            "val": "The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)\/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, advanced and disruptive explosive, fuzing, weapons effects, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable significant improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment.  The DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched, at a minimum, dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD\u2019s relatively small investment leverages DOE\u2019s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services\u2019 needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.\n\nThe JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers that develop technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of munitions laboratory technical directors and senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD gaps, needs, and challenges.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.\n\nThe JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  \n\nThe integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions\u2019 technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 32 current projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success."

These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions and system design and evaluation, including evaluation of lethality, vulnerability and the design of energetic materials (EM) and insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, formulation, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.\n\nThe JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.\n\nEach of the 32 projects has a detailed five year plan with objectives, tasks, deliverables and milestones that is approved annually by a group of 20-plus SES from the DoD munitions laboratories."

                                        "val": "The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new Energetic Materials (EMs) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: 1) new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies, 2) new EM formulations, 3) a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance, and 4) computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.\n\nBoth Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases the only means, to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.\n\nThe Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects and improved lethality.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.\n\nThe desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in part by recommendations of the Long Range Research and Development Program Plan (LRRDPP) and the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining and improving lethality, effects, and safety.  \n\nIn order to clearly establish overmatch, the Department is working to increase the range and speed of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  This thrust includes the development of hypersonic and hyper-velocity weapons.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  DoD may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and the ability to initiate weapons under extreme conditions.\n\nTCG-III is also a forum for the exchange of information on new energetic materials, their performance and sensitivity characteristics, and physical models that can be used to predict the behavior of energetics under adverse and unplanned conditions.  It is a venue in which collaboration opportunities can be identified to facilitate the transition of technology developed in the DOE to the DoD.\n\nThe specific projects in the energetic materials technical focus area for FY 2018 are:\n-  Synthesis, properties, and scale-up of new energetic compounds.\n-  Insensitive munitions and surety.\n-  Cheetah thermochemical code development and experiments.\n-  Micro- and nano-energetics synthesis and initiation.\n-  Hazards analysis of energetic materials.\n-  Reactive processes in energetic materials.\n-  Development of tools for energetic material performance characterization.\n-  Explosives chemistry and properties, and new energetic materials formulation.\n-  Thermal response of energetic materials."

Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department\u2019s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: 1) compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems, 2) trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems, 3) increasing reliability through redundancy, for example, using of two or more smaller initiating systems, and 4) upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. \n\nThe miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects, and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.\n\nThe specific projects in the initiators, fuzes, and sensors technical focus area are:\n-  Firing Systems Technology, comprising FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.\n-  Safe, Arm, Fuze and Fire Technology, comprising Initiation and Detonation, and Advanced Firing System Components.\n-  Advanced Initiation Systems, comprising diagnostics development, microdetonics, miniature initiation systems, and detonators for enhanced safety.\n-  Thermal Battery Performance Modeling to develop a multi-physics modeling capability for thermal batteries.\n-  Thin Film Thermal Batteries to develop, mature, and transition a method to produce a thin, conformal, low-cost thermal battery.\n-  Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) sensors for proximity fuzing of munitions with very low size, weight, and power requirements.\n-  Enabling Robust, Mode-Agile GPS-Denied Weapon Guidance through High-Efficiency Data Processing."

More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. \n\nThe goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny\/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced high-strength, high performance, and ultra-high-performance concretes, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation."

Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating, predicting, and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and\/or components.  These objectives are achieved by identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.\n\nThe specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:\n-  Predictive Materials Aging, including solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.\n-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.\n-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.\n-  Complex system health assessment.\n-  Physical\/chemical reactive transport modeling of material\/system aging and reliability."

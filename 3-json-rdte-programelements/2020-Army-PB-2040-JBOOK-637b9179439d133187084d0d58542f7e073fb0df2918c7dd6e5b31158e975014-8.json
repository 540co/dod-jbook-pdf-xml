The CH-47F project funds modernization, integration and improvements to the CH-47F and MH-47G helicopters through the CH-47F Block II program of record.  \n\nThe CH-47F is a twin-turbine, tandem-rotor, heavy-lift transport helicopter with a useful load of up to 25,000 lbs, representing an essential element of Muti-Domain Battle Operations.  The CH-47F and MH-47G helicopters perform over 95% of the Army's heavy lift missions including troop transport, air assault and resupply in combat, combat support and combat service support roles.\n\nThe CH-47F Block II program provides additional benefits to increase commonality and interoperability between the two platforms, improve design life, lower maintenance cost, enhance reliability, safety, airworthiness, and cybersecurity.  Additionally, funding supports full component qualification for numerous aircraft subsystems such as the Improved Drive Train (IDT) and Advanced Chinook Rotor Blade (ACRB), which increase performance in all environmental conditions (especially at high altitude and increased temperature).  The CH-47F Block II program restores payload lost through mission equipment package (MEP) growth and enhances flight control systems, while providing the most cost effective procurement alternative to maintain heavy lift capability and reduce Operation & Support (O&S) costs.\n\nThe Cargo Project Management Office awarded the CH-47F Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in July 2017.  The EMD phase will produce three production representative test articles to support a Milestone C decision in the 4th quarter of FY21.  This phase will include contractor and Government led system level qualification testing.  The contractor led system level qualification testing includes both ground and flight test.  The Government led system level qualification testing includes Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3), Limited User Test (LUT) and aircraft subsystem Live-Fire Test and Evaluation (LFTE)."

It is capable of training mission tasks and emergency procedures and provides a cost savings when compared to using aircraft for these purposes.  The TFPS will increase safety and mitigate risk to Block II Limited User Test (LUT) aircrews by allowing pilots to train aircraft differences in modifications, handling qualities, performance and human factors considerations before actual flight is performed.  Training in the TFPS reduces LUT timelines and improves aircrew proficiency as confirmed in the CH-47F (Block I) Phase 2 User Test Report.  The initial Block II TFPS will also serve as building block for upgrading the fielded TFPSs to the Block II configuration."

Provide timely, facts-based findings and recommendations for action through formal DoD decision-making processes used to validate operational requirements and apply funding to field integrated, interoperable capabilities. Conduct interoperability assessments, analyses, and integration that evaluate and enhance capability and interoperability of fielded and emerging command, control, communications, computers, and cyber (C5), and systems in response to operational needs and issues.  Conduct integration and integration assessment efforts focused on emerging capabilities in wireless devices and security, tactical command and control and networking, satellite communications, advanced secure digital datalinks, and coalition data exchanges. Employ a deployable capability supporting the collection and analysis of decision quality data for command and control operations from the operational to lowest tactical echelons of command.  Joint analysis supports capability development, acquisition, and systems employment decisions based on quantifiable performance in both actual and replicated operational environments. Projects include:\n\nCoalition Interoperability and Assurance Validation (CIAV) \u2013 CIAV assessments of US and coalition systems support in-theater operations by ensuring C5 system adequacy before their operational employment in the Afghan and Iraq areas of operations.  CIAV is also increasing efforts in the Pacific.  CIAV assessments validate complete and timely exchange of critical information and improve interoperability, enabling coalition forces to fight more effectively and efficiently.\n\nClassified reconfigurable operational wireless network \u2013 the integration, employment, and assessment of a single, rapidly deployed and configurable wireless network that carries multiple classifications. Network is suitable for tactical field settings, temporary installations, and fixed headquarters thereby addressing tactical, operational, and strategic requirements. Employs National Security Agency approved communications security and provides secure communications faster with less hardware and overhead.\n \nJoint fires support joint mission thread interoperability assessment \u2013 assess joint and coalition fire support command and control systems digital (machine-to-machine) interoperability and provide findings and observations.\n\nAdvanced tactical cellular (4G\/LTE) integration \u2013 multiple efforts to increase the availability of 4G\/LTE to tactical forces.  Addresses communications security, smart-phone battlefield apps, and 4G\/LTE survivability in contested and austere environments. \n\nBold Quest (BQ) 2019 coalition interoperability demonstrations \u2013 support the design, plan, and execution of the BQ events which address close air support, counter UAS, IFF testing, and cyber effects on operations for U.S. forces and coalition partners.  Support includes accredited exercise networks, associated C2 systems, and data collection and analysis capabilities.\n \nJoint expeditionary integration capabilities \u2013 integrate, refine, and accelerate the migration of Special Operating Forces (SOF) battle-proven capabilities to general purpose forces in accordance with governing instructions. Rapid migration of SOF \u201cbest practices\u201d provides greater capability to general purpose forces and enhances interoperability with SOF and coalition partners. The capabilities include integrated secure radio networks, tactical data links, tactical cellular, enroute satellite communications, enhanced situational awareness, fratricide prevention, and a more efficient kill-chain. \n\nBattlefield intelligence trusted network environment \u2013 the integration and assessment of an enterprise environment featuring a single, aggregated intelligence sharing capability for multiple partner nations that does not compromise respective national networks or domains.\n\nJoint Planning Services (JPS) \u2013 operational assessment of the JPS pilot will determine if the combatant commanders and Service operational planning requirements would be met by JPS.  JPS is intended to enable planners to develop and maintain complex strategic\/contingency plans in a dispersed, collaborative, cross-functional joint, interagency, intergovernmental, multinational environment.  JPS should also provide rapid access to authoritative, geospatially-enabled planning data and tools and efficient and expeditious information dissemination.\n\nMode 5 analysis \u2013 Plan and execute analysis events at various live venues (such as RED FLAG or BOLD QUEST) in support of certification of Service Mode 5 IFF capabilities.\n\nUSCENTCOM counter-UAS (C-UAS) support \u2013 Conduct analysis activities both at CONUS C-UAS events and in active operational theaters to evaluate effectiveness of rapidly fielded C-UAS systems. Results will inform follow-on fielding and rapid procurement decisions."

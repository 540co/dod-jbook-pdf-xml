By providing fleet input based on current operations with UAS in a simulated combat environment, this CONOPS development investment is the foundation of how the Carrier Strike Group and the Expeditionary Strike Group will operate a combined Manned and Unmanned Naval Air Force. This program establishes the common architecture, including Command & Control, for all unmanned systems to support and inform CONOPS development. This effort provides for a cross-program view of Naval Unmanned Systems and is the entry point for Office of the Secretary of the Defense (OSD) and other services for commonality and interoperability.  Specifically:\n- Provides studies and demonstrations in support of the Naval UAS Family of Systems (FoS) CONOPS development.\n- Horizontally integrates across the Naval UAS FoS for the Naval Aviation Enterprise through interoperability and common system solutions.\n- Develops the Naval UAS FoS Architecture to support integration into the Integrated Warfighter Capability Process.\n- Provides Naval support for development of Standards across Department of Defense (DoD) UAS and North Atlantic Treaty Organization, emphasizing standardization and interoperability.\n- Conducts CONOPS studies, demonstrations, advanced development\/prototyping, and exercises for Vehicle Control, Targeting, and Weapons, Sensor and Payload Employment."

By providing fleet input based on current operations with UAS in a simulated combat environment, this CONOPS development investment is the foundation of how the Carrier Strike Group and the Expeditionary Strike Group will operate a combined Manned and Unmanned Naval Air Force. This program establishes the common architecture, including Command & Control, for all unmanned systems to support and inform CONOPS development. This effort provides for a cross-program view of Naval Unmanned Systems and is the entry point for Office of the Secretary of the Defense (OSD) and other services for commonality and interoperability.  Specifically:\n- Provides studies and demonstrations in support of the Naval UAS Family of Systems (FoS) CONOPS development.\n- Horizontally integrates across the Naval UAS FoS for the Naval Aviation Enterprise through interoperability and common system solutions.\n- Develops the Naval UAS FoS Architecture to support integration into the Integrated Warfighter Capability Process.\n- Provides Naval support for development of Standards across Department of Defense (DoD) UAS and North Atlantic Treaty Organization, emphasizing standardization and interoperability.\n- Conducts CONOPS studies, demonstrations, advanced development\/prototyping, and exercises for Vehicle Control, Targeting, and Weapons, Sensor and Payload Employment."

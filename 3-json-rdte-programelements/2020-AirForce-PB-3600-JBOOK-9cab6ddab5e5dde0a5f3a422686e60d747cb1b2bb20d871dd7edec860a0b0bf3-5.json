            "val": "This program conducts applied research in the area of airmen training, airmen system interfaces, bioeffects, and understanding and shaping adversarial behavior.  The Learning and Operational Readiness project conducts research to measure, accelerate, and expand the cognitive skills necessary to improve airmen training and mission performance. The Human Dynamics Evaluation project conducts research to advance machine intelligence and operator-aiding technologies by developing and\napplying airman-focused research for advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and detecting and exploiting human signatures. The Sensory Evaluation and Decision Science project conducts research to revolutionize the manner in which airmen optimize the capabilities of Air Force systems, including remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and adaptive teams of airmen and machines. The Bioeffects project conducts research on the effects of human exposure to electromagnetic (EM) energy (radio frequency to optical), scalable directed energy weapons, and non-lethal weapons. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

Research is focused in the following areas: human analyst augmentation, human trust and interaction, human signatures, and molecular bioeffects. The human analyst augmentation area develops, integrates, and evaluates human-centric analyst technology to develop cognitive systems engineering solutions for airman data overload, work integration, and mission performance, enhancing operationally effective ISR for the Air Force. This area also includes research to enable and enhance airman-machine teaming for distributed multi-domain operations.  The human trust and interaction area seeks to advance human language technologies to benefit military linguists and analysts as well as to understand, quantify, and calibrate trust factors influencing airman interaction with autonomous systems that can be applied to airman-machine teaming in future weapon systems. The human signatures area develops and applies Science & Technology (S&T) to detect and exploit a variety of human-centered signatures, including behavioral and anthropometric aspects of existing and emerging adversaries as well as bio and molecular signatures of airman performance. The molecular bioeffects area conducts research to protect Airmen from toxic chemicals and materials to include nanomaterials and other advanced development materials and to discover novel biomarkers and molecular mechanisms to support personalized training, performance and protection of Airmen cognitive and physical performance using advanced sense, assess and augment technologies."

Research optimizes airman situational awareness and cognitive performance, improves the airman-machine interface, and seamlessly integrates warfighters with their weapon systems across air, space, and cyber domains.  Research is conducted in four focus areas:  applied neuroscience; human role in semiautonomous systems; battlespace visualization; and battlespace acoustics.  The applied neuroscience area develops technologies to enhance airman-airman and airman-machine collaborations and system interactions in distributed decision-making environments.  The human role in semiautonomous systems area develops new control\/display concepts and technologies to optimize Air Force platform capabilities.  The battlespace visualization area advances the science and technology (S&T) associated with collecting, optimizing, displaying, and assimilating sensory information to enhance warfighter decision-making.  The battlespace acoustics area researches human-human and human-machine communications to exploit the use of voice and acoustic data in collaborative, net-centric environments while accounting for the effects of acoustic propagation."

Research is divided into two core focus areas: optical radiation bioeffects and radio frequency radiation (RFR) bioeffects. Optical radiation bioeffects research enhances combat survivability and systems effectiveness through technologies that enable deployed forces to counter optical threats and exploit optical systems for offensive applications. The RFR bioeffects research investigates basic biological mechanisms of RFR, conducts theoretical and empirical dosimetry, conducts research of bioeffects from short and long-term exposures, develops methods to counter RFR threats, and performs research for exploitation of directed energy systems for offensive capabilities."

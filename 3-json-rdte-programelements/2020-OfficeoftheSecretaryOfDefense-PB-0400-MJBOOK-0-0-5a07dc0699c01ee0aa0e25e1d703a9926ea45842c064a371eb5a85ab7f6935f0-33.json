            "val": "The basic mission of this program element (PE) is to fund innovation to improve the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology (S&T) investments.  The Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF) incentivizes S&T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects:  first, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs; and second, to establish within and among the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  \n\nOECIF funds serve as \u201cseed money\u201d to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovation to be sustained by the Services; therefore, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing transitions rather than one-off projects.  OECIF investments also show areas of Departmental level interest.  The increase in OECIF funding for FY 2020 is aimed to help shape Service investments across six core functional areas within this operational energy domain:  Space Solar Collection, Power Beaming Transmission, Power Beaming Reception, Receiver Power Distribution, Architecture Analytics, and Supporting Technologies.\n\nIt is imperative that DoD sustain a competitive position to innovate and manage stealthy and portable power beaming initiatives which provide freedom of movement for the warfighter.  OECIF projects are selected annually from Service and Combatant Command proposals that align with the Department\u2019s 2016 Operational Energy Strategy and support that fiscal year\u2019s OECIF theme.  The theme reflects the Department's priorities and focuses S&T investments.  The Department is due for a new Operational Energy Strategy, and OECIF is actively shaping and contributing to the Innovation sections.  Ultimately, the true value of an OECIF project is dependent on a successful transition to the Warfighter.  The benefits may be realized through materiel efforts (fielded equipment, enhanced sub-systems) or non-materiel improvements (i.e., modeling and simulations capabilities, education and training, and development of standards).  The overall aim is to improve the operational effectiveness of the Joint Force."

In FY 2020, OECIF projects are expected to emphasize space, weapons, and electronic warfare as emerging capabilities and will be shaped by FY 2018 Operational Energy S&T gaps and roadmaps.  Near-peer competitors are overmatching DoD in power beaming and space solar technologies for battlefield advantage, necessitating a critical OECIF effort to address the shortfalls.  Per the findings and recommendations of the recent DoD study \u201cOpportunities and Challenges for Space Solar for Remote Installations,\" measured, comprehensive investments at the Advanced Technology Development (Budget Activity 3) level will be made in six focus areas:\n \n(1) Space Solar Collection \u2013 Low-cost, lightweight photovoltaics through revolutionary production methods are key to manufacturing at scale.  Once produced, thermal, radiation, and space qualification testing is needed.  FY 2020 investment level:  $7.200 million.\n(2) Power Beaming Transmission \u2013 High-efficiency, compact microwave\/millimeter-wave\/optical source integration with power transmitters is needed.  High specific power transmitters, particularly in the short-wave infrared, will be built and tested.  FY 2020 investment level:  $5.900 million.\n(3) Power Beaming Reception \u2013 Tactically deployable ground receivers for power beaming do not currently exist.  Variable power density-compatible, portable, ruggedized, modular receivers will be developed and tested.  FY 2020 investment level:  $6.100 million.\n(4) Receiver Power Distribution \u2013 Deployed microgrid and storage integration for power receiver usage is required for effective utilization. Operations scenarios for crewed and autonomous users will be formulated and hardware prototypes implemented.  FY 2020 investment level:  $2.400 million.\n(5) Architecture Analytics \u2013 Campaign modeling and examination of the implications of different means of energy conversion and ground and space segment approaches will critically focus investments and drive Conops development.  FY 2020 investment level:  $3.000 million.\n(6) Integrating Technologies \u2013 Leap ahead technologies in large area metrology, high-altitude receiver craft, thermal management, high voltage management, and airborne tether technologies are critical to ensuring integration of the final capability.  FY 2020 investment level:  $5.400 million.\n\nThese elements kick-off efforts for power beaming and space solar capabilities to increase warfighter lethality and reduce logistical burdens.  For contexts of ground-to-ground, elevated, high-altitude, low earth orbit, and higher orbits, the progression of power beaming capabilities to include longer links and higher powers will provide a credible path to an operational capability.  OECIF will continue engagement with OSD, Services, and CCMDs for validation of development strategies for FY 2021 and beyond."

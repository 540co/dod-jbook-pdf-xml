The environment will utilize the services provided by the Common Computing Environment (CCE).   \n\nCCE provides standardized platforms, common application support services, data center migration strategy, and security services for hosting AF mission applications. This acquisition is critical for multiple hosting environments leveraging DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) Core Data Centers (CDC), commercial cloud capabilities and DISA brokered cloud capabilities in compliance with the Air Force Information Technology (AF IT) baselines.  This effort also provides technical expertise, programmatic guidance, and policy navigation that supports AF approved application rationalization processes to multiple hosting environments and enterprise IT Lifecycle Capabilities Integration Environment (CIE) testing of CCE services.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapons system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

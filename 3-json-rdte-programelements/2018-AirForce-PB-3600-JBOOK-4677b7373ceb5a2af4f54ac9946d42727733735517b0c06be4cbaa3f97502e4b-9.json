This initiative is accomplished through each service\u2019s Organizational Server. The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) consumes data from various Air Force Authoritative Data Sources (ADSs), validates it, formats it in a consistent force structure data standard, and publishes it for consumption by programs of record that use force structure data. The AFOS is the ADS for Air Force Authorized Force Structure and provides critical unit, billet, crew platform, vehicle, and command relationship data within the Air Force to the Joint Staff (J8) for war and contingency planning, by providing visibility of the entire force structure as a function of time: past, present and future.\n\nThe AFOS produces consistent force structure data in the Global Force Management Information Exchange Model format that is well defined, centrally managed, and interoperable as a standardized representation of the organization\u2019s hierarchy in all other programs of record that use force structure data. The end goal of the GFM-DI AFOS is to integrate the four force management processes (Assignment, Manpower & Personnel, Readiness, and Allocation), and ensure the data is available to meet the needs of all users, systems and functions. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

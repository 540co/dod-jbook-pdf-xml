This will be done in one of two methods, depending on which solution will result in less maintenance cost in future years.  The first method would be a process that changes the fields displayed and data values in drop down lists depending on the asset type.  The second method would be to develop separate processes for the asset types.  DPAS will conduct user meetings in FY18 to determine the full scope of the requirements and develop the capabilities in FY19.\n\nDPAS will continue to provide support for the Financial Audit.  The Department will have completed the first full audit and have findings that must be addressed.  DPAS will work with each Service or Agency to determine the areas that DPAS can increase capability to permit the findings to be closed.

                            "val": "As adversaries develop more sophisticated technology tactics, the cyber Science and Technology (S&T) community must remain agile, vigilant, and evermore creative in response.  Starting in late FY 2016, the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) reviewed new cyber threats and the emerging needs of the joint operational community.  As a result, a new strategic vision was developed to enhance the DoD\u2019s tactical edge in a rapidly evolving cyber domain.  Beginning in FY 2018, the following new projects were initiated in the research areas (described below): \n\n\u2022\tBehavioral Cyber Science:  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior by moving beyond binary electronic signals towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral science will increase the effectiveness of tools, increase the effectiveness of the cyber workforce, and improve the utility of cyber solutions.  Behavioral cyber science seeks to uncover details about how humans (represented by operators, users, adversaries, and\/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood, from a behavioral science standpoint, and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcomes.\n\n\u2022\tSelf-Securing Systems:  Prevailing in a contested cyber environment will require new sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity to protect the increasingly complex weapon systems and platforms that help DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Exploring foundational research in self-securing systems will arm future DoD systems with the capability to proactively, autonomously, and seamlessly assess cyber threats.  Additionally, future systems will be able to deploy self-defense mechanisms to neutralize cyber-attacks, and enable blue forces to maneuver at will.  Autonomous cyber defenses will need to apply the most current advances in artificial intelligence research.\n\n\u2022\tPrecise Cyber Effects:  Precision offensive campaigns for the cyber domain require accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects to enable DoD leadership to achieve the desired outcomes from cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.  Exploring methods to derive quantifiable metrics will help improve the precision control of selecting cyber mission targets and raise the accuracy of effects; achieving an understanding of second and third order of effects will provide commanders with a higher confidence of success and limit collateral damage.\n\n\u2022\tApplied Mathematics:  Advancing mathematical foundations that are intrinsically linked to all branches of cyber science and technology, will cut across focus areas producing new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.  This area of research will characterize the cyber domain, maintain the integrity of data, harden systems, and analyze potential solutions. \n\nAdvances in these cyber S&T areas will promote strong foundations, while disruptive innovations will create surprise, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas are critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cybersecurity beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense."

Research in behavioral cyber science will advance the understanding and technical rigor of modeling and predicting human responses to cyber activities which will ultimately enhance cyber operations through planning, and training.  Future research must broaden the scope beyond the impacts of cyber actions on equipment to include the impact that these cyber actions will have on human behavior and our adversary\u2019s forces.  Just as an adversary\u2019s behavior may be better understood using behavioral cyber science, behavioral science can be used to improve the actions of cyber defenders and the performance of the cyber workforce.  Data gleaned from observing effects of various cyber operations on users\u2019 productivity, performance, and security will help the DoD design better techniques and processes for use in cyber defense and operation."

The vast majority of DoD weapons systems, platforms, and networks rely on software to operate.  Software can often be disrupted remotely, which necessitates a new kind of security to protect against such cyber-attacks.  Defending the software and network-based aspects of critical weapon systems is challenging for a number of reasons, chief among which is the advanced nature of the adversary in the cyber realm.  Future cyber adversaries will be well-funded, well-informed, and agile.  Building weapon systems, platforms, and networks that defend themselves in real time will be vital in protecting ourselves against this adversary.  The Department needs systems that can autonomously monitor and manage their own health and security posture through advanced sensing and perception, reasoning, and planning.  Such systems identify and classify threats much more quickly than a human operator, and therefore, neutralize the threat more quickly and effectively.  However, researchers must be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of turning security over to autonomous systems.  Verification techniques must be developed to ensure that autonomous and dynamic system changes maintain correct mission-focused capabilities without introducing unintended vulnerabilities.  Conversely, developing techniques to track and audit actions taken by autonomous systems ensures that direct control can be reasserted."

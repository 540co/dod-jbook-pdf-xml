The acquisition and product support workforce provides cutting edge weapon systems, sustainment capabilities, and is charged with providing management, tools, and technical and business capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs throughout their life cycle.  The direct funded acquisition workforce funded in this program element will support all phases of acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel.  These program elements support both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

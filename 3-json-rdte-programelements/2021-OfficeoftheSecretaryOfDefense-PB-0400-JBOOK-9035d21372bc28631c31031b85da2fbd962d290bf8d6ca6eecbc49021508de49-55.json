This program oversees advanced engineering development and rapid fielding throughout the DoD for an integrated and systemic approach for countering nuclear threats and the development of nuclear and conventional physical security material solutions.  Public Law, Presidential and DoD-level guidance, and Combatant Command and Service requirements drive the priorities for these programs.\n\nUnder this PE, funding associated with nuclear and convention physical security material solution for the Department is broken down into seven capability areas: (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The material solutions either (a) lead to a Programs of Record transitioning to Program Element 0604161D8Z for Systems Development and Demonstration; (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial\/Government off-the-shelf product.  The Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort, ensuring systems integration, and promoting interoperability and sustainability.\n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including staffing, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development, and test and evaluation efforts."

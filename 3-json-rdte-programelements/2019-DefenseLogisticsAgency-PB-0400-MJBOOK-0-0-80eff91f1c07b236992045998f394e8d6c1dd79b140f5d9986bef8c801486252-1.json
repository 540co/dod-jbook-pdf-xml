            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, as well as combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides virtually 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate \u2013 including food, uniforms, fuel and energy, medical supplies, construction and barrier materials and equipment, and more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts.  DLA also provides logistics services including logistics information data, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and documents automation and production services. DLAs Logistics Research and Development (Log R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are used to accomplish the agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure.  Log R&D identifies the best commercial business practices and tailors them, as necessary, into the most effective business processes for the agency.  Logistics R&D develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at the lowest possible costs. \n\nThe DLA Log R&D program is organized into three SFAs:\n\u2022Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support: R&D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.  \n\u2022Improving Logistics Processes: R&D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.\n\u2022Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements: R&D efforts to support emergent Logistics R&D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  The SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA scope includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes."

The MLN program supports the Medical Directorate\u2019s mission to develop and implement the critical logistics and medical supply chain business practices that ensure the cost-effective and efficient distribution of medical materiel to the full range of Military Health System operations.\n\n-Weapon System Sustainment (WSS): $29.625M. This project was realigned to SFA Improving Logistics Processes. The WSS program spans multiple weapon systems and supply chains to improve internal processes, provide new methods, reduce costs and lead times, and ultimately, improve readiness for DLA customers.  \n\n-Supply Chain Management (SCM): $20.574M. This project was realigned to SFA Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements. The SCM program provides the Agency with the resources needed to quickly take advantage of new ideas emerging from the Center Commanders, Process Owners, or Staff Directors.\n\n-Strategic Distribution & Disposition (SDD): $19.396M. This project was realigned to SFA Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support. The SDD program improves DLA\u2019s distribution and disposition capabilities, operational effectiveness, and efficiency in support of the Services, COCOMs, and DOD in CONUS, OCONUS, and deployed locations.\n\n-Energy Readiness Program (ERP): $15.796M. This project was realigned to SFA Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements. The ERP includes Program Management Office Support (PMO) for developing program strategies and goals; Alternate Energy Development (AED) to include test and certification to support the addition of synthetic and alternative fuels to mobility fuel specifications and acquisition plan; Improving Class IIIB supply chain through Current Product Improvement (CPI) (such as the study and development of fuel additives and studies to increase sources of supply) and Infrastructure & Process Improvement (such as the development of analytical tools).\n\n-Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR): $9.305M. This project was realigned to Industrial Manufacturing PE 70708011S. The DLIR program researches, identifies, and implements potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available to support the nation\u2019s warfighter. The technical areas of interest is the development of Logistics Data Interoperability & Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility."

Services have engineering responsibility for most Class IX parts. Many T\/Q sub-processes involve interactions with Service engineering functions, which often are time-consuming and costly. Other key T\/Q sub-processes are essential to the procurement function, such as analysis of parts content, source capabilities and problem resolution.\n\nSelected Process Improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical\/Quality (T\/Q) function.

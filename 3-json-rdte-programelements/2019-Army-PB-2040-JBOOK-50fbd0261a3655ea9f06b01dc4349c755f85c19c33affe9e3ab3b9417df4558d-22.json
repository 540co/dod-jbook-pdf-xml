            "val": "The Army has a need to improve capabilities to defend maneuver formations and other tactical echelons from low altitude air attack and surveillance. Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten the ability of maneuver forces to conduct operations.  Specifically, maneuver formations require improved air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Rocket Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.  \n\nThis additional capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach that enables rapid fielding of an initial capability, culminating in a program of record that will field a full capability.  Initially, the Army will field an interim M-SHORAD solution using an Army Senior Leader Directed Requirement, informed by an FY 2017 M-SHORAD Demonstration.  The system or system-of-systems solution will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), and Group 1 - 3 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) while keeping pace and surviving with the maneuver Brigades.  This interim solution will be fielded in up to three M-SHORAD battalions. The objective solution is needed to counter FW, RW, UAS, and indirect fires (RAM) threats. Both mounted and dismounted capabilities are required. As part of the objective solution, the 50 kilowatt laser will be assessed for possible transition from Science Technology to an objective M-SHORAD program in FY2022. \n\nFY 2019 base and OCO dollars in the amount of $118.085 million will continue the interim M-SHORAD capability development and integration of the identified solution into existing maneuver formation equipment. Efforts will include: complete fabrication of production representative articles; begin testing to achieve Urgent Materiel Release; and continue the development and finalization of the required program documentation.\n\nAdditionally, FY2019 funds will continue development of an objective M-SHORAD Family of Systems, to include: complete the objective M-SHORAD Family of Systems Analysis of Alternatives (AoA); complete development and approval of all Milestone A documentation; begin Concept Design Development for all M-SHORAD Family of Systems variants, and continue Contract Package development."

The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.\n\nThe portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) Efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability.  Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.\n\nDTRA\u2019s Counter- Improvised Explosive Device \/ Counter - Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED\/C-sUAS) mission includes three primary lines of effort - attack the supporting threat network, protecting US forces, and building partner capacity.  Since DTRA already provides this support in helping the Department counter IEDs for the US joint force, it follows that DTRA is the most-appropriate Department asset to undertake this C-sUAS coordination mission - to provide counter threat network support to deployed forces, C-IED\/C-sUAS technology solutions, C-IED\/C-sUAS training support (deploying and deployed US joint forces), and building partner nation capacity all while coordinating the overall Department's (C-IED\/C-sUAS) efforts."

The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation-hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic deterrence system requirements.  The Human Survivability effort supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs."

This effort develops and integrates sensing technologies with multi-mission Unmanned Aerial System payloads.  (2) The Countering WMD (CWMD) weapons effects effort develops modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations.  (3)  The Innovative Technologies and Engineering effort takes promising technologies discovered under fundamental and basic research and further develops them to increase the effectiveness of weapons against blast doors and other underground structures for functional defeat of Underground Facilities (UGFs), WMD, and their delivery systems."

Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and to (2) to assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries."

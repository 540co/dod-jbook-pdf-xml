Funds support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects. In addition, this PE provides support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address environmental quality requirements under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Program.\n\nThe Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change to the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal. The Project involves systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life. It provides support to the system acquisition community (Program and Project Managers) to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process. The goal of the effort is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs, including efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities.\n\nThe Pollution Prevention Tech Support Project funds the management support costs to execute the Toxic Metals Reduction, Airborne Lead Reduction, and Low Global Warming Potential (LGWP) environmental quality technology programs, which support Cross Functional Teams and the Army's top modernization priorities by addressing potential obsolescence of legacy materials and current and emerging impacts on human health and the environment."

The focus of ESAL is on improving readiness, enabling mission capabilities, improving acquisition processes, reducing supportability burden, and minimizing total ownership cost. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment has defined the functions of the ESAL project in coordination with the Army Acquisition Executive and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology). This Project provides direct support to the Army acquisition community to pursue environmental sustainability and comply with legal statutes, policies and regulations during the life cycle of Army materiel. ESAL helps address Army Modernization Priorities, while sustaining readiness and achieving compliance with its weapon systems, industrial base, field and deployed activities directed by international treaties, Federal statutes, Executive Orders, Department of Defense (DoD) and Army policies and regulations."

            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates technologies to support Air Force electronic combat warfighting capabilities.  The program focuses on developing components, subsystems, and technologies with potential aerospace combat, special operations, and airlift electronic combat applications. It develops and demonstrates technologies for integrating electronic combat sensors and systems into a fused and seamless whole. It integrates and focuses research efforts in electronic warfare (EW) and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding. It develops and demonstrates technologies for navigation and timing in radio frequency (RF) contested and denied environments. It develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for RF electronic combat suites and advanced warning and countermeasure technologies to defeat electro-optical, infrared, and laser threats to aerospace platforms. It also develops and demonstrates technologies that identify and mitigate avionics system cyber vulnerabilities as well as protects avionics and other critical technologies. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nStarting in FY 2017 to improve reporting to Congress, Project 634335, Cyber Concepts was created to capture all cyber activity that was previously performed under Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

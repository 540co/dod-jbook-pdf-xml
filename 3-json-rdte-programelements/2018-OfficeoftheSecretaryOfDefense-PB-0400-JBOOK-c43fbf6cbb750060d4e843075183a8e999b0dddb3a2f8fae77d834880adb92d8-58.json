            "val": "PE 0305304D8Z was established in FY2013 and plays a pivotal role in the Department\u2019s ability to achieve audit readiness, enhance the Department\u2019s goal of energy efficiency, gain a full accountability of Real Property assets, as well as improve data quality and integration across the full spectrum of EI&E business functions.  The PE helped conduct a full Business Process Re-engineering of the processes used to collect energy information, and publishing an EEIM data standard and a additional effort to build out data stores and portal requirements for Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) management.  Funding is also used to support ASD EI&E Senior Real Property Officer accountability requirements by supporting management and oversight of reconciliation efforts and auditability by determining requirements for the department's Real Property inventory records and asset management processes, business rules and associated data standards.  A major component of this capability is an enterprise EI&E Data Analytics & Integration Support (DAIS) platform coupled with a independent verification & validation capability. With access to real time data through services WSDLS, reports generated through business intelligence provide immediate indicators driving improved and quicker decisions.\n\nIn 2015, it was determined that the current state of cyber security of energy-related (and other real property-related) control systems (such as the electronic\/computer controls on heating, ventilation & air conditioning equipment) is deficient, and a $1,000,000 increase in FY2016 funding was allocated above the EEIM baseline to support a multi-year real property-related control systems cyber security initiative."

Integration with accurate Real property asset, Utilization, Military Construction, Environmental, and installation Geospatial data is equally key to ensuring these decisions for planning and reporting are possible.  It also supports development of The geospatial portal for visualizing energy layers with other EI&E data on installation or area maps for improved spatial analysis.  This portal is the DOD aggregated repository for DoD Common Installation Picture layers.  Additionally, the map viewer is customized and easier  for OSD senior staff to manipulate and includes an online catalog of maps, documents and data; and a secure, robust data exchange module.

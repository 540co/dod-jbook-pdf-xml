The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is developing the concepts for an MOKV based on a modular open systems architecture designed to common interfaces and standards, making upgrades easier, and enabling a more competitive, broader supplier industrial base. \n\nMOKV will rely on a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) architecture that balances performance across the sensor, Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications, and kill vehicle elements. Analysis shows that having multiple kill vehicles on each interceptor can dramatically improve the performance of the system, significantly reduce the burden on interceptor inventory, and reduce cost per kill to defend the Homeland."

In FY 2019, MDA will continue limited risk reduction for selected kill vehicle and carrier vehicle component technologies that lower technical risk.  MOKV limited component technology risk reduction will draw from existing efforts such as engagement management, communications, seekers and advanced sensors, divert attitude and control systems, integrated avionics, and inertial measurement units.

Second, conduct risk reduction activities to identify and mature the technology necessary to increase the reliability and performance of our kill vehicles using the Advanced Technology Innovation Broad Agency Announcement and competitive procurements.  Make investments that mitigate the component technology gaps for future multi- object kill vehicles that enhance the competitive environment. Third, leverage the technical expertise of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, University Applied Research Centers, and Universities and government laboratories to independently develop reference concept using proven modeling and analysis techniques."

DoD ABIS supports identity superiority capabilities for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.

DoD ABIS has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).\n\nThe Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) is the Executive Agent for DoD Biometrics and the proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services and DoD.  DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvements, and implementation of efficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers.\n\nJustification:\n\nFY 2019 RDT&E funding in the amount of $989 Thousand (DT2: Non-MIP Biometrics) supports developmental testing and limited user testing for the SLEP (DoD ABIS v 1.3) \nFY 2019 funding in the amount of $1.411 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability assessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders."

The resulting contract for DoD ABIS Sustainment Services and SLEP was awarded on June 30, 2017.  This upgrade is extremely critical in order to replace end of life hardware and software components, including Commercial Off the Shelf products whose versions currently included in DoD ABIS v1.2 are no longer supported.  The SLEP (v1.3) will extend the service life of the current capability through FY22 and transition to sustainment and will improve interoperability with other government entities such as the FBI, DHS, and Department of Justice.  The Army is currently staffing an Information System-Capability Development Document (IS-CDD) for BEC Increment 1 that will continue to improve upon the DoD ABIS."

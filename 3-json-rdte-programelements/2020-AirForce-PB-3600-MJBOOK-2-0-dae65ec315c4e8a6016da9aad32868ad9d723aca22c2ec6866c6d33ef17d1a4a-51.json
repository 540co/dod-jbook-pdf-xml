            "val": "Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) enables tactical edge Joint and Coalition information interoperability via air, space, and surface systems, to include a Backbone Network for high capacity data transfer.  As requirements emerge, BACN will integrate new hardware and software capabilities that improve system performance, interoperability, availability and open mission system technologies.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, expansion of external time reference capabilities, Military GPS enhancements, integration of advanced antennas and waveforms, and assimilation of mandates levied on the BACN systems.  This effort will include an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that will develop and integrate Military GPS on the E-11A BACN platform. Military GPS is required for BACN fleet to fly in increasingly contested AORs. Safety of flight considerations, including performance, aircraft structural integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements will be addressed.  Efforts will include required non-recurring engineering and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, the development of simulators\/trainers, development of training materials, and technical publications.\n\nExecute the acquisition and sustainment of two (2) complete Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) Payload systems operation and maintenance training simulators and two (2) Payload Control Element (PCE) operations and maintenance training simulators.  The BACN Payload simulators are designed for replication of both the E-11A and the EQ-4B platforms with platform-dependent payload configurations; one simulator for each platform.  The PCE simulators will be specifically designed for both the PCE-Launch (L) configuration and the PCE-Mission (M) configuration.  This effort would include design of all trainers (E-11A payload, EQ-4B payload, PCE-L, and PCE-M), training materials, operations and maintenance technical manuals for the assigned trainers.\n\nExecute risk reduction activities for development of future capabilities on BACN payload\/aircraft efforts. \nThis effort will including developing the data and publications needed for a Program of Record\nThis effort will include Acquisition Support Contractors\n\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BACN capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

As requirements emerge, BACN will integrate new hardware and software capabilities that improve system performance, interoperability, availability and open mission system technologies.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, expansion of external time reference capabilities, Military GPS enhancements, integration of advanced antennas and waveforms, and assimilation of mandates levied on the BACN systems.  This effort will include an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that will develop and integrate Military GPS on the E-11A BACN platform. Military GPS is required for BACN fleet to fly in increasingly contested AORs. Safety of flight considerations, including performance, aircraft structural integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements will be addressed.  Efforts will include required non-recurring engineering and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, the development of simulators\/trainers, development of training materials, and technical publications.\n\nExecute risk reduction activities for development of future capabilities on BACN payload\/aircraft efforts. \n\nExecute the acquisition and sustainment of two (2) complete Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) Payload systems operation and maintenance training simulators and two (2) Payload Control Element (PCE) operations and maintenance training simulators.  The BACN Payload simulators are designed for replication of both the E-11A and the EQ-4B platforms with platform-dependent payload configurations; one simulator for each platform.  The PCE simulators will be specifically designed for both the PCE-Launch (L) configuration and the PCE-Mission (M) configuration.  This effort would include design of all trainers (E-11A payload, EQ-4B payload, PCE-L, and PCE-M), training materials, operations and maintenance technical manuals for the assigned trainers.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BACN capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F."

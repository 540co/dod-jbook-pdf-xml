Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.\n\nThe Basic Research Initiatives program element (PE) supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative, and the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship Program (Vannevar Bush), formerly known as the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program."

This plan defines actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of producing high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for the Department.  SSBR initiatives support the five Basic Research Office strategic goals:  (1) drive the direction of DoD basic research investments; (2) coordinate and conduct oversight of DoD basic research programs; (3) improve the science and engineering (S&E) workforce and public outreach; (4) enhance university-industry collaboration; and (5) engage with the academic research community and international partners.\n\nThe Minerva Research Initiative, a department-wide basic research program in the social sciences directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, seeks to build a fundamental understanding of the sources of present and future conflict.  It is one of the Nation\u2019s only social science basic research programs in support of national security.  Minerva promotes a deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radicalization and regional instabilities develop, and supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally, and are updated annually according to inputs from across the defense enterprise."

STIx showcased and connected the nation's brightest minds to communicate new ideas and share novel approaches to confronting old challenges facing the defense community.  Its Ted-like lightening talks were streamed online over two days and are posted on the web.\n\nPlanned and published a broad agency announcement for the Defense Enterprise Scientific Initiative (DESI) pilot program with assistance from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in August 2017.  DESI was funded through the FY 2017 plus-up.  The program aims to inspire the collaboration among universities and industries in fundamental research.\n\nExecuted the first competition for the I-Corps @ DoD Commercialization pilot program, and supported 6 teams established in FY 2016.  One team received follow-on private capital to commercialize their research and another received the most improved award from the National Science Foundation's I-Corps teaching team.  The second competition is currently underway and will fund up to 12 teams.\n\nSelected ten laboratory scientists for the 2017 class of Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative (LUCI) Fellows.  The research topics included advanced manufacturing, robotics, data analytics, optics and novel engineering materials.  The awardees included NDSEG and SMART Fellowship recipients.  Organized the first review of the LUCI program in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory in September 2017."

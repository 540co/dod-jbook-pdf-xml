This effort develops and integrates new capability and architectures to optimize fielded weapon systems and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) to defeat these emerging threats. \n\nThe Missile Defeat Project coordinates and integrates Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) efforts to develop counter threat capability.  This effort measures the effectiveness of new architectures and revolutionary concepts against evolving threats by working with the IC, Combatant Commands, government labs, program offices, industry, and academia. \n\nTo meet this challenge the Missile Defeat Project leverages existing test and simulated environments to perform analysis of industry and government reference concepts and architectures to provide innovative technical solutions for missile defeat.  We are developing virtual and physical testbeds to robustly test, evaluate, and prototype architectures and assess their ability to improve time critical targeting and defeat of road-mobile threats.  The virtual testbed complements testing at physical ranges by providing an infrastructure for addressing different training, test, and evaluation needs.  This effort also includes systems engineering and analysis to devolve technical requirements, identify promising solutions, and inform future investment decisions.\n\nIn accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year FY 2017, the Department shall designate a military department or Defense Agency with acquisition authority with respect to missile defeat.  The Missile Defeat Project will transfer all activities and funding to other stakeholders starting in FY 2019.  The FY 2019 request enables this transfer without interrupting ongoing efforts.  \n\nFY 2018 AMENDED BUDGET REQUEST JUSTIFICATION: $26.400 million Base is required to address emergency warfighting readiness requirements.  Funds are required for various classified projects.  Additional classified details can be provided under a separate cover."

The system will meet the full scope of Army Contracting requirements, including those in secure and non-secure locations, those supporting combat or non-combat contingencies, those within or outside the borders of the Continental United States, those supporting grants and assistance agreements, and those performing weapons systems, construction, installation, and other specialized contracting activities. \n\nThis is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed each of the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, Army received an OSD Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 29 October 2014. On 24 March 2016, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology re-designated the ACWS as an ACAT IAM (MAIS) program and authorized the release of the RFP to procure a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system. ACWS just completed an aggressive Source Selection and conducted an Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) meeting with the Army Acquisition Executive in March 2017, and received approval from the Defense Acquisition Executive to proceed to contract award in April 2017.  Contract Award is anticipated in May 2017."

RR will include several key activities conducted in parallel.  First, the program will conduct Global Analysis and Business Blueprinting to optimize the Army\u2019s \u201cTo-Be,\u201d End-to-End, Procure-to-Pay processes and business scenarios. The program will define applicable Business Process Designs, identify any gaps between the COTS product and the ACWS requirements and determine how to resolve those gaps.  This will all be done with the goal to align Army processes, as much as possible, to the COTS product processes. This will save significant development dollars.  This phase will also include design of the required interfaces that are not included as part of the original COTS solution. The ultimate goal of this phase is to maintain the COTS baseline and reduce requirement for customization with a plan that allocates capabilities and interfaces across all software builds. The allocated baseline will be reviewed\/ approved during a Preliminary Design Review."

These activities are conducted for the purpose of meeting the USD AT&L timeline goals to sunset SPS. The anticipated contract award date is 3Q FY 2017. The first task order (guaranteed minimum) will be the RR phase focusing on BPR, Global Analysis and Blueprinting. During the Risk Reduction phase, ACWS will continue to prepare for its ATP-2 (MS B) in FY 2018. The next 48 months will be development and deployment, followed by 60 months of sustainment activities."

FY2016 and FY2017 funding is now documented in the exhibits for PE 1206441F.\n\nPrior Years: Total Program Element above includes $39.831M for Project 65A040 Commercially Hosted Payload funded in FY 2011 and FY 2012.  MDAP PNO 210 includes only Project 653616 SBIRS High EMD."

            "val": "The SBIRS RDT&E FY 2018 budget justification exhibits describe three elements of the SBIRS program: 1) the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program of record PNO 210 MDAP, 2) the Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) (non-MDAP) and the 3) Evolved SBIRS follow-on (pre-MDAP PNO 499).\n\n1. SBIRS EMD:  The Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces, and its allies. SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. SBIRS supports Missile Defense, Battlespace Awareness, and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable, accurate, and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, the intelligence community, and other users. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance over legacy systems in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's (AFSPC) Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements. The space segment consists of Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements, communications infrastructure, and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. Three HEO payloads and three GEO satellites are on-orbit.  Two of the three GEO and two of the three HEO satellites have completed AFSPC and USSTRATCOM operational acceptance and are certified for Integrated Tactical Warning\/Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations.  HEO-3 is in a storage\/residual operational mode and GEO-4 (Flight 3) is proceeding through on-orbit checkout and infrared sensor tuning following the Jan 2017 launch. The program of record ground segment development exploits both the new scanner and starer sensor data through software processing and builds user messages for missile warning and missile defense. Also, data exploitation efforts enable access to raw and processed data to expand capabilities for battlespace awareness and other applications.  FY 2018 funds support ground segment development.  The baseline requirement document is the 1996 SBIRS ORD. Enterprise systems engineering and integration (SE&I) provides intra- and inter-program requirements development, enterprise master planning, validation and verification, specialty engineering, and architecture development. \n\n2. SMI:  The primary objective of SMI is to enable and inform future decisions to maintain and evolve a capable, resilient, and affordable OPIR architecture by maturing technologies and mitigating risk areas to facilitate OPIR modernization within the Department's constrained resources. SMI supports the Program of Record (PoR) by assessing future parts and material obsolescence and designing future space and ground modifications focused on affordability and capability while simultaneously maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements.  The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current PoR SBIRS constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. Based on the outcome of these studies and technology development, the Sensor Ground Demonstration will develop capability for current, next generation sensors, processors, and algorithms.  SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR mission data processing, data fusion, data dissemination, algorithm development, network connectivity, efficient interfaces and sensor performance assessments to enable greater exploitation of SBIRS PoR and other data sources. SMI exploitation efforts build upon PoR capabilities and inform the PoR decision process. The data exploitation efforts identify affordable, responsive and resilient measures to improve technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to enhance OPIR support to the warfighters and other data users. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View (WFOV) Testbed activities explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem\/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture. Hosted Payloads and WFOV Testbeds support maturation of mission data processing algorithms for tactical and strategic applications which are critical demonstration efforts to enhance PoR capabilities and to reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the PoR.  Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and to reduce risk for possible SBIRS follow-on architectures.  SBIRS Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) infrastructure modernization efforts under SMI will introduce Telemetry, Tracking and Command systems (TT&C) and Ground Control automation, Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) mission data processing as well as competition into SBIRS Ground with an emphasis to on-ramp to EGS as soon as practical.  SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded tradespace and improve the competitive environment.\n\n3.  The Evolved SBIRS RDT&E FY 2018 budget justification exhibits describes the SBIRS Next-Generation OPIR program (pre-MDAP PNO 499). This program, BA 05 PE 1206441F, project 657106, EVOLVED SBIRS, is a new start.\n\nSBIRS Next-Gen OPIR: The SBIRS\u2019 primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces, and its allies. SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. The SBIRS Next-Gen OPIR will provide improved strategic missile warning coverage and increased resiliency in a strategic constellation to meet the requirements laid out in the Air Force draft Capability Development Document (CDD) based on the AFSPC Space Warfighter Construct (SWC) in response to the Space Enterprise Vision (SEV). The SBIRS Next Gen OPIR systems includes both the space and ground elements. The Next Gen OPIR space segment will consist of  GEO and HEO satellites, providing real-time persistent global infrared coverage using a highly resilient bus with modernized payloads. The space segment will begin development of HEO space vehicles in FY21.  FORGE and EGS are infrastructure modernization efforts also aligned with AFSPC SWC. The FORGE effort will implement an open framework for mission data processing and migration of C2 of satellite operations to integrate with EGS. FORGE and EGS efforts will provide the flexibility to integrate new mission data processing capabilities and more efficiently allow the system to meet evolving warfighter needs.\n\nThis program element is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. SBIRS supports Missile Defense, Battlespace Awareness, and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable, accurate, and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, the intelligence community, and other users. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance over legacy systems in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's (AFSPC) Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements. The space segment consists of Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements, communications infrastructure, and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. The three HEO payloads and two GEO satellites are on-orbit.  Both GEO and two of the three HEO satellites have completed AFSPC and USSTRATCOM operational acceptance and are certified for Integrated Tactical Warning\/Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations.  HEO-3 is in a storage\/residual operational mode.  The program of record ground segment development exploits both the new scanner and starer sensor data through software processing and builds user messages for missile warning and missile defense. Also, data exploitation efforts enable access to raw and processed data to expand capabilities for battlespace awareness and other applications.  SBIRS ground system cyber defense increases resiliency by resolving legacy DSP network architecture issues and establishes an active cyber defense capability. FY 2018 funds support ground segment development.  The baseline requirement document is the 1996 SBIRS ORD. Enterprise systems engineering and integration (SE&I) provides intra- and inter-program requirements development, enterprise master planning, validation and verification, specialty engineering, and architecture development."

SMI supports the Program of Record (PoR) by assessing future parts and material obsolescence and designing future space and ground modifications focused on affordability and capability while simultaneously maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements.  The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current PoR SBIRS constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. Based on the outcome of these studies and technology development, the Sensor Ground Demonstration will develop capability for current, next generation sensors, processors, and algorithms.  SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR mission data processing, data fusion, data dissemination, algorithm development, network connectivity, efficient interfaces and sensor performance assessments to enable greater exploitation of SBIRS PoR and other data sources. SMI exploitation efforts build upon PoR capabilities and inform the PoR decision process. The data exploitation efforts identify affordable, responsive and resilient measures to improve technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to enhance OPIR support to the warfighters and other data users. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View (WFOV) Testbed activities explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem\/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture. Hosted Payloads and WFOV Testbeds support maturation of mission data processing algorithms for tactical and strategic applications which are critical demonstration efforts to enhance PoR capabilities and to reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the PoR.  Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and to reduce risk for possible SBIRS follow-on architectures.  SBIRS Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) infrastructure modernization efforts under SMI will introduce Telemetry, Tracking and Command systems (TT&C) and Ground Control automation, Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) mission data processing as well as competition into SBIRS Ground with an emphasis to on-ramp to EGS as soon as practical.  SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded tradespace and improve the competitive environment."

SBIRS and other sensors provide a rich data set for exploitation. SMI data exploitation enables access to raw and processed data for data analysts and application developers to expand capabilities for battlespace awareness and other applications. SMI data exploitation efforts are complementary to, and enhance, the exploitation capabilities delivered by the PoR and inform future PoR exploitation efforts.  SMI will develop tools and algorithms to enable users to apply OPIR data to support their mission needs. Data exploitation efforts are also evaluating tools for command and control, mission management, and mission data processing for risk reduction to support evolution of the SBIRS PoR ground system to an open architecture that could support PoR and other future satellites and payload alternatives.

The end-state will be a modern technical infrastructure which is cyber-secure and resilient against the Advanced Persistent Threat and employs streamlined architecting, acquisition, and operational processes.  Through early architecture studies and prototyping, the government will establish clear ownership of the technical baseline to meet Better Buying Power principles as the EGS effort evolves through development.  This effort provides focus and expertise for the development, test, certification and enforcement of standards and interfaces for all AFSPC satellite ground systems to enable transition planning for legacy ground systems, new capability demonstrations, and systems acquisition leading to an enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems."

The program office will collaborate with appropriate contracting agencies to support each individual effort. Data exploitation efforts in the laboratory and the Battlespace Awareness center will leverage existing external contracts, as well as new internal competitive contracts.   Activities, such as SBIRS obsolescence and affordability enhancements to the existing satellite design, will leverage existing Program of Record contracts. Technology maturation and component prototyping and\/or qualification could leverage existing contracts; in fact many are planned in collaboration with AFRL and other government agencies.  Where practical, other efforts could be competed.  FFRDC and SETA contractors will also be used to conduct and support studies.  New technology, replacement components, and system designs will be acquired with government data rights to the maximum extent to allow their incorporation into any future OPIR satellite production or system development.  Contracting partnerships with other agencies will also be used to study, develop, demonstrate and prove emerging capabilities."

SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. The SBIRS Next-Gen OPIR will provide improved strategic missile warning coverage and increased resiliency in a strategic constellation to meet the requirements laid out in the Air Force draft Capability Development Document (CDD) based on the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Space Warfighting Construct (SWC) in response to the Space Enterprise Vision (SEV).\n\nThe SBIRS Next Gen OPIR systems includes both the space and ground elements. The Next Gen OPIR space segment will consist of Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) satellites, providing real-time persistent global infrared coverage using highly resilient bus with modernized payloads. The space segment will begin development of HEO space vehicles in FY21. The Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) and Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) are infrastructure modernization efforts to meet requirements laid out in the AFSPC SWC. The FORGE effort will implement an open framework for mission data processing and migration of C2 of satellite operations to integrate with EGS.

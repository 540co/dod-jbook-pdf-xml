CSEL provides a hand held radio as part of the mandatory aircrew survival gear. CSEL is a joint program (AF, Army, and Navy) and is the DoD program of record for personnel recovery survival radios. CSEL supports four of five Personnel Mission Phases: Report, Locate, Support, and Recover.\n\nA National Security Agency (NSA) Cryptographic Modernization mandate and the Ultra High Frequency Follow-On satellite constellation are at the end of life and are driving upgrades to base stations. This effort includes development to modernize the system to integrate common waveforms, integrate broadcast reception for non- CSEL devices, provide for cryptographic modernization, leverage software defined capabilities based on the FY16 cryptographic study, and to procure intellectual\nproperty. CSEL will leverage software defined capabilities to replace the legacy handheld radio with a new device that supports report, locate, and recovery missions. The new device will leverage technological advancements and efficiencies to develop a more intuitive device that enables secure communication between the joint warfighter and rescue support teams. This funding will also be used to perform various studies and analysis in support of the CSEL Enterprise.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CSEL capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nIn FY2018, PE 0305176F, Combat Survivor Evader Locator efforts were transferred to PE 1203176F, Combat Survivor Evader Locator, due to the creation of a new Major Force Program (MFP) for Space programs. In FY2021, CSEL efforts were transferred back to PE 0305176F to more closely align the program's efforts with a more applicable MFP.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

This program supports fundamental broad-based scientific and engineering research in areas critical to Air Force weapon, sensor, and support systems.  All research areas are subject to long-range planning and technical review by both Air Force and tri-Service scientific planning groups. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nIn FY 2018, a portion of HQ AFRL S&T civilian manpower in PE 0601102F, Defense Research Sciences, was transferred to PE 0602298F, Science and Technology Management - Major Headquarters Activities, to provide increased transparency to Congress on personnel in Major Headquarters Activities (MHA). \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."

Research stresses high-risk, far-term, game-changing capability breakthroughs essential for future leaps in warfighter system performance, functionality, reliability, and survivability while simultaneously reducing component and system power, size, mass, and life cycle costs. Major areas being investigated in this project are complex electronics and fundamental quantum processes; plasma physics and high energy density non-equilibrium processes; and lasers and optics, electromagnetics, communication, and signal processing. While the following specific sub-areas are the focus of the project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major efforts as well as those in the other projects within this program."

Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are aero-structure interactions and control; energy, power, and propulsion; and complex materials and structures. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program."

                "val": "The increase in FY 2020 supports the continuation of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) at a higher level of funding than in FY 2019. FY 2020 supports increased investments in Advanced Technological Development (ATD) focused on Disruptive Technologies providing a greater than 70% solution to the following areas: Buried Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), Attack the Network, Home-Made Explosives (HME), and System Attributes across the Portfolio Range including Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence. Strategically aligned investments include increased investments in improved autonomous capabilities supporting the detection and defeat of improvised threats and the integration of Artificial Reality (AR)\/Virtual Reality (VR) into C-IT capabilities.  These areas of investment continue to be identified time and again as challenging problem sets for the warfighters as identified by the CCMDs and warfighting commands in their Integrated Priority List (IPLs) and Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON).  The Continuation of ATD activities is critical to advancing current initiatives to the prototype phase in the following areas: Remote Controlled IED (RCIED) & Stand-off Detection.  This investment supports further development, testing, and prototyping of advanced Modelling, Visualization, and Simulation capabilities for processor-intensive analytics to support warfighters operating in tactical environments. The capability directly supports mission planning, targeting, and post-operation analysis by troops operating in tactical theaters of operation. For example, the capability will support mission planning by providing first-person experiential mission planning through immersion in a 3-D virtual model of a target mission environment that is augmented by inputs from multiple sensor platforms. The tactical user may interact with the virtual model of the target mission environment through head-mounted and\/or handheld devices. Mission planning augmented in this manner may improve targeting accuracy and provide improved force protection in tactical environments."

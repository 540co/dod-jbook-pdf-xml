The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU\/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  The HBCU\/MI program is authorized by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2362 and is funded by annual appropriations.  This competitive program provides support through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts for research, education assistance, and instrumentation purchases.\n\nWork in this PE provides a foundation to enhance participation of HBCUs\/MIs in DoD research, including infrastructure; strengthen research and educational opportunities at HBCUs\/MIs and increase the number of minority graduates in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines important to the national defense; and build a more diverse pool of scientists and engineers to meet future workforce needs.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Services\u2019 Research Offices and DoD Laboratories (includes the Army Research Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory) for Centers of Excellence (COE).  Currently funded centers through cooperative agreements include COE in Autonomy, Cyber Security, and Research Data Analysis."

The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU\/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.\n\n\u2022  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.\n\n\u2022  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work\/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer intern programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.\n\n\u2022  Instrumentation purchases.  The program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements to essential research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.\n\n\u2022  Technical assistance.  The funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU\/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts."

The competition resulted in 75 equipment grant awards totaling $28.500 million.  Recipients included: 29 HBCUs, one Tribal College, and 45 in other categories of MIs.  Initiated a special leadership project with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) under which TMCF, a non-profit organization, assists in the selection of HBCU\/MI students for scholarships and internships in pursuit of STEM careers.  Under the newly established Centers of Excellence (COEs) in support of the ASD(R&E) Science and Technology priorities in the areas of Cyber Security, Research Data Analysis, and Autonomy, supported 12 students in the summer of 2016 at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome, NY.  Under the TMCF and the COEs, increased the number of FY 2016 summer interns from 79 (in FY 2015) to 85 participants in the DoD laboratories.  The students received stipends for participating in the research at the DoD laboratories.  Established an OSD and Department of the Navy (DoN) Cyber Security Information Assurance Program Partnership, which provided internship\/co-op opportunities for four HBCU\/MI students in the area of information assurance\/cyber security.  Conducted two outreach webinars to expose HBCUs\/MIs to opportunities in DoD totaling $0.230 million.  Nearly 250 individuals representing over 50 HBCUs\/MIs attended the webinars.  Co-hosted two technical workshops (October 2015 and January 2016) with the Office of Naval Research in which representatives from seven local HBCUs and three other institutions of higher education participated."

                            "val": "Manpower Operations Systems (MOS) is a portfolio of enterprise IT systems and modules that support manpower business operations for the Total Force (active and reserve). The investment in the portfolio improves dataflow and increases reliability, functionality, and accuracy of data while reducing the manpower required to operate and maintain these systems\/operations. Development is partially driven by regulatory and policy changes mandated by Congress, DOD, Department of the Navy (DON), and United States Marine Corps (USMC).  These systems support all five tiers of Manpower: 1) Individual Marine, 2) Small Unit Leader; 3) Unit, 4) Installation Personnel Administration Center (IPAC)\/Disbursing Echelon, and 5) Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA)\/Defense Finance and Accounting Service. The MOS portfolio provides support in functional areas such as permanent change of station assignments, retention, mobilization, manpower planning, line of duty determination, personnel accountability, individual augmentation, personnel records management and maintenance, management of case incidents, civilian professional development planning, pay entitlement determinations, promotion and performance evaluations and self-service\/visibility of personnel data. MOS programs interface with other systems to provide manpower data and web services functionality for pay and personnel transactions between systems. Systems in the portfolio include the Web-enabled Manpower Assignment Support System (WebMASS), Automated Performance Evaluation System (APES), Total Force Retention System (TFRS), Optical Digital Imaging - Records Management System (ODI-RMS), Marine Corps Force Augmentation System (MCFAPS), Secure Personnel Accountability (SPA) and the Requirements, Transition and Manpower Management System (RTAMMS).  The current systems have become obsolete and are unable to maintain an acceptable Cyber Security posture.  Modernization efforts will involve business process and application reengineering, with a focus on redefining the Human Resource\nDevelopment Process (HRDP) to deliver a portfolio of streamlined capabilities on a modern and secure platform.\n    \nMarine Corps Enterprise Information Technology Services (MCEITS) provides an overarching portfolio of capabilities to deliver \"Power to the Edge\" for the Marine Corps. Born from an effort to establish a Continuity of Operations Plan of HQMC Automated Information Systems, MCEITS enables realignment of the existing USMC environment of applications, databases, networks, and facilities into an integrated architecture of programs to deliver new information technology capabilities based on a common infrastructure and shared services. MCEITS is a unifying framework of both the Enterprise Services to be delivered, and the infrastructure and systems which must be deployed to enable delivery of those services. Initially it will encompass the Operational, Technical, and Systems architectures of the enterprise environment. However, ultimately it will extend to transform information access both in garrison and in the deployed environment. Combined with policy, procedure and standards provided by HQMC (C4), MCEITS will allow for architectural standardization, consolidated management, and seamless interoperability of and access to the data residing in currently fielded applications (business and tactical). Testing efforts will be focused on MCEITS provided services operating within a MCEITS hosting environment. MCEITS enables services to be federated throughout the Marine Corps to include Content Discover and Delivery, Collaboration and Text Chat, between the service consumer and provider. Efforts for MCEITS will focus on application migration development, the analysis, research and design of increments 3 & 4 and the technology refreshed software and hardware infrastructure, modernized and enhanced MCEITS high availability, automation and service management with continued Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) efforts.  \n\nMarine Corps Recruiting Information Support System (MCRISS) is an enterprise level system to automate administrative procedures for the recruiting station operations. This customized automated System, centered on procedures in the Guidebook for Recruiters, Volume I, dramatically improves efficiency and effectiveness in Marine Corps recruiting.  Furthermore, Military Entrance Processing Command requires Marine Corps recruiting to provide information in electronic format only. MCRISS is the Marine Corps Recruiting Command's program to manage applicant processing from commitment to accession\/commission into the Marine Corps and Marine Corps Reserve. This enterprise approach allows for efficient sharing of information about potential recruits and recruiter screening efforts, yielding a more cost effective process. The current system requires modernization of the systematic recruiting components to provide efficiency for the Recruiting force from the Headquarters element down to the Recruiter, and requires numerous updates in order to become fully compliant with Cyber Security and CNA policies and mandates to protect PII\/PHI data captured and stored in the system. The Modernization effort will involve  a competitive evaluation of several prototype systems, leading to a selection of a viable platform and the complete replacement of the current MCRISS system with modern and secure technology.\n\nPaperless Office\/Acquisition (PA) funding supports development and enhancement of Purchase Request (PR) Builder, which is the Marine Corps enterprise solution for the electronic generation of purchase requests, funding documents, miscellaneous payments, and serves as the front-end system for feeding the DOD enterprise contracting writing system Standard Procurement System (SPS). PR Builder is a fully web-based, Mission Assurance Category (MAC) III sensitive business system that provides the Marine Corps with a net-centric capability to electronically create, route for approval, and apply funding to Purchase Requests (PRs), Funding Documents, and Miscellaneous Payments. PR Builder is the authoritative procurement generation system within the Marine Corps electronic Paperless Acquisition (PA) Systems Business Enterprise that provides system-to-system interaction with the Marine Corps' Standard Procurement System (SPS)\/Procurement Desktop Defense (PD2,Department of Defense (DoD) Standard Accounting, Budgeting, and Reporting\nSystem (SABRS), Electronic Document Access (EDA). These systems are critical to Marine Corps purchasing, contracting and procurement tracking control.   \n\nReadiness Reporting System-Marine Corps (RRS-MC), formerly Defense Readiness Reporting System-Marine Corps (DRRS-MC)  - the Command Individual Risk and Resiliency Assessment System (CIRRAS), formerly known as the Force Preservation Program Tool Integrated Clinical Management-Risk Mitigation System (FPPT ICM-RMS), funding will develop software to enable commanding officers and senior enlisted advisors to make more informed and timely decisions on Force Preservation (FP) risk assessments, based on identifying and tracking individual Service Member (SM) behaviors associated with increased risk or resiliency as defined by the Marine Corps \"Six Fs\" (Fidelity, Fighter, Fitness, Family, Finances, and Future).  CIRRAS will close FP implementation and process gaps by fielding an enterprise-wide system to manage individual SM FP risk by providing a consistent approach and a standardized methodology to support protective factors and mitigate adverse outcomes.  This funding will deploy additional FP functionality to increase the ability to perform, inform, and record behavioral Service Member risk assessment within the Marine Corps. The enhanced CIRRAS capabilities to be implemented will automate the risk and resiliency scores, send automated alerts to leadership of \"at risk\" personnel, and implement additional system interfaces that will provide further key FP indicator data to assist in prevention of SM suicide.\n\nTechnology Services Organization (TSO): This Technical refresh\/upgrade of Standard Accounting Budgeting Reporting System (SABRS) database technology from ADABAS to a newer database architecture provides a modern and well-supported database technology that ultimately enables the normalization of Marine Corps financial data in a true relational database. The newer database architecture will provide a modern data platform to support transactional operations within the DON General Fund accounting systems to optimize performance, readily scale, and reliably support data structure, quality, and availability for subsequent analysis to drive decision making.  Successful implementation will be transparent to the SABRS user community while minimizing the potential for unanticipated system degradation\/outages and secure the system's operational longevity.  This Multi phased project (over 4 years), system supports 5k+ direct users, impacts entire DON General Funds accounting.  Out year costs will be assumed into planned sustainment of SABRS. \nThe current configuration is antiquated with diminishing industry support. There is a limited pool of applicants available to work on ADABAS.  Sustainment is cost prohibitive and the technology stack limits flexibility to fully support 21st century data\/system requirements.  TSO will be unable to mitigate identified technical and support risk associated with current technology which could result in systems degradation and\/or outage.  This further leaves TSO unable to improve data integrity and audit compliance in SABRS by employing a more modern database.  The impact on the operational capability is the risk to DON accounting and Financial Management operations increases daily for major system degradation or outage in both likelihood of occurrence and extent of the negative impact of such an occurrence. This will result in the system becoming less and less viable to the point where it will no longer support Marine Corps operations."

Define, develop, and deliver an initial or \"core\" capability based on mature technology. 2. \"Core\" capability will be incrementally improved over an extended period of time. Incremental Development Model: 1. Iterative cycles of requirements definition, design, build and evaluation. The contracting strategy across the portfolio is to utilize competitive firm-fixed price contracts. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMarine Corps Enterprise Information Technology Services (MCEITS) is using an incremental acquisition approached implemented in separate releases followed by Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3Is) delivering capabilities faster and more efficiently.  The program will deliver an initial capability and continue integration and production of the system in accordance with the USMC Information Enterprise Strategy. The objective is to balance needs with available commercial and government solutions and resources, and to rapidly adopt evolving technologies and requirements and keep pace with the continuously evolving DoD Net-Centric enterprise to provide capabilities to the Marines. This strategy is supported by an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracting vehicle which will allow the contractor to provide the full range of capabilities, services and solutions necessary to satisfy the requirements through incremental implementation of technology, processes and capabilities. Capabilities will be delivered through individual task orders to ensure technology and services are inserted according to the overall program goals, user requirements and program schedule.\n\nPaperless Acquisition (PA) will use an incremental development methodology utilizing short development periods. The contracting strategy is to use a firm-fixed price contract to reduce risk to government, with additional capabilities defined by a Marine Corps Configuration Control Board and delivered to the service integrator as a modification to the contract. The delivery of small functional capabilities allows for measurable enhancements to the base system while keeping Post Deployment System Support costs relatively low. \t\n\nReadiness Reporting System-Marine Corps (RRS-MC)(Formerly Defense Readiness Reporting System-Marine Corps (DRRS-MC) is a Mission Assurance Category I (MAC I) Classified system that integrates information on reportable unit readiness (Marines\/ Equipment) and mission effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces.  Mission (Core\/Assigned) determined to be vital to the operational readiness and mission effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces. The operation mission of Command Individual Risk and Resiliency Assessment System  (CIRRAS), formerly known as Force Preservation Program Tool Integrated Clinical Management-Risk Mitigation System (FPPT ICM-RMS), is that it will enable Commanding Officers and Senior Enlisted Advisors to make informed decisions on force preservation assessments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMarine Corps Recruiting Information Support System (MCRISS) utilizes modular\/incremental development to maintain system operability while allowing for continued development. Contracting strategy for Legacy system support includes competitive firm-fixed price IDIQ contracts; MCRISS Modernization effort to be executed leveraging direct-award opportunity to a qualified 8(a) small business partner.\n\nTechnology Services Organization (TSO) SABRS:  Funding will assist with research and development of the most efficient approach for transitioning the DON General Fund Accounting System, SABRS, to a modern data platform in order to eliminate the risk associated with an aging and expensive technology with dwindling number of technical experts.  This Technical refresh\/upgrade of SABRS database technology from ADABAS to a newer database architecture provides a modern and well-supported database technology that ultimately enables the normalization of Marine Corps financial data in a true relational database."

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  \n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nStryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and ECP 2 efforts. ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration a suite of complementary lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).\n\nLight Armored Vehicle improvement program will design, test and modify two Light Armored Vehicles (LAV-25A2s) for Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) to inform operational concepts for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in support of Global Response Force early entry operations.  This will directly support the expeditionary maneuver excursion that will be conducted by the XVIII Airborne Corps in FY17-18.\n\nM113 improvements will develop an affordable solution for upgrading the M113s to enhance protection, survivability, mobility and power generation to support the current and future network systems.  This will provide the necessary enhancements to the M113 capability for Echelons Above Brigade (EAB) units with priority to the forward deployed units and equipment sets.  The Armored Multi Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program will replace all M113 family of vehicles in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT).\n\nThe Recovery Vehicle Improvement program is a group of ECPs that will allow the current recovery vehicle to regain Single Vehicle Recovery for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle. The current M88A2 is not capable of single vehicle recovery of the M1A2 SEPv2 in all situations and the M1A2 SEPv3 fielding in FY20 will further exacerbate the recovery problem."

The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes M1 Abrams turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles.  The HERCULES provides Single Vehicle Recovery of the 70 Ton Abrams tank.\n\nThe 1998 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) required Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) of a 70T Main Battle Tank.  The Abrams SEPv2 CURRENTLY exceeds the 70T ORD requirement and the M88A2 is unable to safely perform SVR of MBT in all conditions.  SEPv3 further exacerbates the problem.  Current doctrine requires a holdback vehicle for loads > 70T and the M88A2 multi-vehicle towing is not resourced or trained.  The approved CPD as of 10 Jan 2017, requires the Improved M88A2 (M88A2E1) to enable \u201cSingle Vehicle Recovery of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.\u201d\n\nTechnical assessments and analyses will be used to clarify the capability gap (Single Vehicle Recovery), evaluate design solution concepts, and inform key program decision points.  The goal of the assessments will be to provide confidence to Army Leadership that a M88A2E1 solution is affordable, achievable, and technologically feasible with manageable risk. Limited analyses, conducted to date, suggests that upgrades to the M88A2 track, suspension, transmission, hydraulics and potentially powertrain are required. \n\nFY 2018 Base dollars in the amount of $5 million will be used to support M88A2 baseline testing and conduct sub-system trade analyses.  FY 2018 Base dollars will also be used for Program Management Support and Contractor and Government Systems Engineering for labor and travel to effectively manage the program."

This approach was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY2011.\n\nThe Abrams vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. In order to restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams. The ECPs will incorporate lost power generation and distribution technologies, force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection Systems, technologies to mitigate obsolescence issues, in-bound technologies under development, and technologies to decrease the overall weight of the tank."

To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army existing programs of record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army program of records, including continued SINCGARS integration and Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command \u2013 Platform (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP 2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY 2017.   The Bradley M2A4 Vehicle is the combination of the M2A3 Base Vehicle with ECP 1 and ECP 2 components installed and integrated.   Additionally, a follow on Engineering Change Proposal to ECP 2, ECP 2b integrates Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) to replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability along with other technology upgrades and insertions (i.e. laser pointing, color camera, laser range finder, Vehicular Integration for Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and, Reconnaissance\/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY) architecture compliance, etc). Product Manager Bradley will execute a Non Development Initiative (NDI) to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System. A separate integration effort begins in FY 2018 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats."

ECP 1 production contract was awarded in FY 2014, and began fielding in FY 2015.  ECP 2 is scheduled to begin fielding in FY 2019 to address powerpack and electrical power upgrades, which will enable the vehicle to host Army directed inbound technologies with no further performance degradation to the vehicle. ECP 2 development has been executed on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract to the current platform Original Equipment Manufacturer. Initiate studies and analysis in order to integrate Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) sights began in FY 2016. The 3GEN FLIR (ECP 2b) system will be developed by Project Manager, Terrestrial Sensors (PM TS) and be provided to Product Manager Bradley as a Horizontal Technology Insertion effort.  Product Manager Bradley will execute a Non Development Initiative (NDI) in order to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System in FY 2018."

Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and ECP 2 efforts. ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs)."

In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  \n\nOn 2 July 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker Operational Needs Statement (ONS) Lethality effort.  ONS Lethality Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contracts for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Logistics Products Development\/Test Support were awarded in Jan 2016 and May 2016, respectively (Cost Plus Incentive-Fee basis).  The ONS Lethality Production\/Retrofit contract was awarded in May 2016 through an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).  Definitization of the Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Production contract occurred in March 2017.\n\nThe ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approval to initiate the ECP2 effort was received in a 30 September 2016 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM)."

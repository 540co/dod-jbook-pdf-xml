Activties include funding for research and development, support equipment, contract services and all associated costs specifically identified to support the JPRA headquarters at Ft. Belvoir, VA and other JPRA operating locations.\n\nIn FY16, the Common Distress Reporting System (CDRS) began development.  CDRS will integrate all personnel locating devices into the existing reporting device architecture & Combat Survivor Evader Locater base stations to provide one common operating picture for timely and efficient recovery operations of isolated personnel.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year."

The program supports core missions such as Sensitive Reconnaissance Operations (outlined in CJCSI 3250.01) in addition to other missions that include execution of CCMD OPLANs and CONPLANs, Humanitarian Assistance\/Disaster Response (HADR), Counter-Insurgency (COIN) operations and third-party treaty verification\/monitoring via the OLIVE HARVEST mission. \n\nThe Air Force continues to invest and modernize the U-2 program in the 2020 President's Budget by addressing reliability, maintainability, supportability, diminishing manufacturing sources\/ material shortages (DMS\/MS), flight test, safety issues, and integration of capability development activities in support of the broader ISR portfolio. RDT&E efforts will address sustainment, modification, and modernization of sensors and associated mission equipment, and focus on integrating\/expanding platform capabilities within the larger ISR portfolio; these efforts include (but are not limited to) ASARS 2B\/C, avionics and navigation tech refresh, mission planning software and infrastructure upgrades, modernization of aircraft data links, next generation SIGINT, and developing a quick reaction capability (QRC), enabling improved collection against emerging threats and capabilities.  \n\nAdditionally, the U-2 program will continue to prioritize emergent and\/or experimental RDT&E efforts designed to mitigate the rapidly evolving combat environment (e.g. electromagnetic requirements) in order to maintain safety and operational relevance through current and future U-2 operating locations. \n\nCurrently, the U-2 Program provides funding for an Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) acquisition effort. This effort will design, fabricate, integrate, and demonstrate system capability enhancements for a high altitude deep look SAR system. This mitigates a Diminishing Manufacturing Supply and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issue with the current U-2 SAR sensor.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

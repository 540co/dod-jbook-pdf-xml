            "val": "Replacement of the legacy tanker fleet will take place in several stages.  The initial tanker replacement increment of KC-46s will replace roughly a third of the current capability.  Future programs will ultimately recapitalize the entire tanker fleet over a period of more than 30 years.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the tanker replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The program is procuring four RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability which will ultimately be operationally fielded.  During production, the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots.  The KC-46 program held a MS C DAB on 12 Aug 2016 and received approval to enter Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  The program awarded LRIP Lots 1 and 2 on 18 Aug 2016 and LRIP Lot 3 on 27 Jan 2017, totaling 34 aircraft.  KC-46 funding also supports Training Systems, Direct Mission Support, Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, government developmental and operational test support, mission planning capability development, various studies and analyses, and future tanker replacement planning activities.\n\nThe KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for worldwide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battlespace awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nThe Aircrew Training System (ATS) and the Maintenance Training System (MTS) are being developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The ATS contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation.  The ATS contract will provide Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), to include Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), Boom Operator Trainers (BOTs), Fuselage Trainers (FuTs), and Part-Task Trainers (PTTs) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).  The ATS contract will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire a technical data package to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  \n\nThe MTS acquisition focuses on designing, developing, testing, producing, and fielding an optimized training system for KC-46 maintainers by integrating various forms of training media and Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs) into a \"blended\" solution.  This blended solution includes the appropriate mix of hardware and software, \"high-fidelity\" Augmented Hardware Training Devices (AHTDs), PTTs, Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), and emerging technologies to meet validated Air Mobility Command (AMC) maintenance training requirements. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it passed MS C approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. \n\nIn FY 2016, $26.691M is no longer a part of the KC-46 program baseline (BPAC 655271) since it was approved to source the Counter-small Unmanned Aerial System Joint Emergent Operational Need (C-s UAS JEON), AFLCMC\/HBU (Force Protection) program, as a Rapid Acquisition Authority (RAA) funded effort.  This funding will not be reported in the Selected Acquisition Report (SAR)."

                            "val": "Replacement of the legacy tanker fleet will take place in several stages.  The initial tanker replacement increment of KC-46s will replace roughly a third of the current capability.  Future programs will ultimately recapitalize the entire tanker fleet over a period of more than 30 years.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the tanker replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The program is procuring four RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability which will ultimately be operationally fielded.  During production, the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots.  The KC-46 program held a MS C DAB on 12 Aug 2016 and received approval to enter Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  The program awarded LRIP Lots 1 and 2 on 18 Aug 2016 and LRIP Lot 3 on 27 Jan 2017, totaling 34 aircraft.  KC-46 funding also supports Training Systems, Direct Mission Support, Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, government developmental and operational test support, mission planning capability development, various studies and analyses, and future tanker replacement planning activities.\n\nThe KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for worldwide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battlespace awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nThe Aircrew Training System (ATS) and the Maintenance Training System (MTS) are being developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The ATS contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation.  The ATS contract will provide Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), to include Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), Boom Operator Trainers (BOTs), Fuselage Trainers (FuTs), and Part-Task Trainers (PTTs) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).  The ATS contract will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire a technical data package to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  \n\nThe MTS contract was awarded 6 Jul 2016 to The Boeing Company.  The MTS acquisition focuses on designing, developing, testing, producing, and fielding an optimized training system for KC-46 maintainers by integrating various forms of training media and Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs) into a \"blended\" solution.  This blended solution includes the appropriate mix of hardware and software, \"high-fidelity\" Augmented Hardware Training Devices (AHTDs), PTTs, Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), and emerging technologies to meet validated Air Mobility Command (AMC) maintenance training requirements. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it passed MS C approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. \n\nIn FY 2016, $26.691M is no longer a part of the KC-46 program baseline (BPAC 655271) since it was approved to source the Counter-small Unmanned Aerial System Joint Emergent Operational Need (C-sUAS JEON), AFLCMC\/HBU (Force Protection) program, as a Rapid Acquisition Authority (RAA) funded effort.  This funding will not be reported in the SAR."

                            "val": "The KC-46 Program acquisition strategy is to procure an existing commercial, FAA certified aircraft modified to meet USAF requirements. The KC-46 program released a final RFP on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010. The KC-46 program held a MS B DAB on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter EMD from the USD(AT&L) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft. The KC-46 contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, and resulted in a FY 2011 EMD Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract. The EMD phase will develop, build, and test four KC-46 aircraft, and will qualify the KC-46 as a tanker and certify pairings with receiver aircraft.\n\nThe MS B acquisition strategy planned for two LRIP lots followed by 11 Full Rate Production (FRP) lots for a total aircraft procurement of 175 production aircraft. An update to the acquisition strategy occurred in support of Milestone C (MS C) that increased LRIP from two to four lots and the remaining nine to be FRP lots with the total aircraft buy remaining at 175 Production aircraft (+4 EMD aircraft, with a grand total of 179 aircraft).\n\nLRIP began with two Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and two FFP Not to Exceed (NTE) options (LRIP-1 Qty 7, LRIP-2 Qty 12, LRIP-3 Qty 15, and LRIP-4 Qty 15) followed by nine FFP FRP options [via NTE values + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)]. LRIP Lots 1 and 2 were awarded on 18 Aug 2016 and LRIP Lot 3 was awarded on 27 Jan 2017.  The FRP options will be exercised following successful completion of IOT&E.\n\nThe ATS acquisition strategy is to provide ATDs, and associated support structure, to each MOB and the FTU. The ATS contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation. The ATS contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per FAR Part 15, and resulted in an FY 2013 EMD FPIF contract. The ATS EMD phase will develop and procure ATDs; and will be supported with courseware, Training System Support Center, the technical data package, and support equipment to ensure system availability and concurrency with the aircraft. The ATS initial production options were exercised in Aug 2015. \n\nThe MTS acquisition strategy is to acquire MTDs, and associated support structure, for two AMC active duty Regional Maintenance Training Facilities.  The MTS contract was awarded 6 Jul 2016 to The Boeing Company. The MTS procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per FAR Part 15, and resulted in an FY 2016 EMD FFP contract. The MTS EMD phase will develop and procure MTDs; and will be supported with courseware, Training System Support Center, the technical data package, and support equipment to ensure system availability and concurrency with the aircraft.\n\nThe KC-46 Program is responsible for the development, testing, and production of a drogue-equipped, wing-mounted refueling system to meet Capability Development Document (CDD) thresholds and objectives for simultaneous refueling of two probe-equipped receivers. The system can be installed or removed from the KC-46 as mission needs dictate.\n\nThe long-term support concept for the KC-46 is organic two-level maintenance (2LM): organization level (O-level) and depot level (D-level). For the purposes of this program, all maintenance other than O-level shall be referred to as D-level. The product support strategy will initially employ Interim Contractor Support (ICS) before transitioning to a 100% organically-managed maintenance and supply support capability. Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solutions will be evaluated during EMD as viable approaches to facilitate the transition."

The contract ceiling price of $4.9B is the government's maximum financial liability on the prime contract.  The \"Total Cost\" value represents the MS C Service Cost Position (SCP), which accounts for the ceiling price of the contract plus the financial and schedule risk of potential design changes for the KC-46 aircraft.\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: The KC-46 is evaluated against traditional Research and Development (R&D) program expenditure benchmarks.  Unlike many traditional R&D programs, the KC-46 EMD contract is a FPIF contract with progress payments.  Twenty percent of incurred costs are withheld until the end of the contract, when they are liquidated.  Mandatory funding obligations and progress payment withholds will cause the program to lag traditional expenditure benchmarks, painting an inaccurate portrait of overall program health."

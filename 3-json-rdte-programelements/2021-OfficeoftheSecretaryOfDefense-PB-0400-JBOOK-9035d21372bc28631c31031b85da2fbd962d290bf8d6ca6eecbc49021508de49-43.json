The program will develop and deploy ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) 5G networks at DoD sites to evaluate and enhance 5G systems and technologies for domestic and expeditionary DoD missions.  This will include both the direct use of commercially available capabilities and DoD-specific technology enhancements that highly leverage commercial capabilities.  The program will also develop, test, and evaluate technology solutions to identify and mitigate the security challenges that 5G and NextG technologies will present in order to enable the military to operate through zero-trust networks. The program will:\n\n\u2022 Deploy flexible 5G infrastructure at approximately eight U.S. military facilities to enable varied applications and networking prototypes\n\u2022 Evaluate at least sixteen different DoD 5G applications at DoD facilities across the Services \n\u2022 Invest in DoD-focused 5G tactical, operational and strategic networking prototypes to expand the utility of commercial technologies for DoD missions \n\u2022 Demonstrate the capacity to \u201coperate through\u201d in contested environments using dynamic spectrum utilization and by learning how to both defend and exploit 5G networks through security vulnerability assessment\n\nThe program will deliver fieldable prototype capabilities that will remain in place at designated DoD locations as well as lessons learned to promulgate 5G knowledge and tradecraft.  This will ensure that both near-term and future generations of information and communications technologies will be capable of supporting US military and national security objectives.\n\nThe program will be executed through established support agreements with DoD Service laboratories and through existing DoD and Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) (including General Services Administration (GSA) contracts) that are suitable and cost-effective for 5G technology prototyping and telecommunications network equipment procurement and integration."

Develop tactical, operational, and strategic networking prototypes to demonstrate capabilities to dynamically share congested spectrum between military systems and commercial wireless networks.  \n\nCapabilities will be prototyped and evaluated at-scale within highly dynamic and contested RF environments.  The Congested\/Contested Spectrum research, development, and experimentation activities will deliver fieldable prototype capabilities that will remain in place at designated DoD locations.  Those that do not perform sufficiently well will still provide lessons learned to promulgate 5G knowledge and tradecraft.  These deliverables will inform base\/camp\/station modernization and recapitalization investments as prototypes transition to enduring infrastructure."

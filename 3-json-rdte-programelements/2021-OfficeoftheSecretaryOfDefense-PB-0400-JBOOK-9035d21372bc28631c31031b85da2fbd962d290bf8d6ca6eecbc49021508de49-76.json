Funding supports policy and guidance for incorporation of alternative means of PNT delivery to augment GPS. Funding also supports the DoD\u2019s PNT Oversight Council and inputs into interagency activities under the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee.\n\nIn support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), GPS continues to provide a force multiplier for the Joint Force and key US allies. Its modernization, and alternative, complement means of PNT provision will maintain this advantage. Superior PNT provides enhanced Joint Force lethality through precision targeting, exacting ISR, efficient logistics, blue force tracking, and a myriad of other force enhancements. These are enjoyed by the Joint Force and key US allies. As such, they ensure efficient and effective force employment.\n\nThe Integrated Planning and Management Project encompasses the Nuclear Management Office's (NMO) responsibilities for establishing overall DoD policy and oversight with respect to the capability development, interoperability, standards, and architecture for National Command Capabilities for our Nation\u2019s Senior Leadership.  The NMO serves as the single point of contact within the Department for policy, long-range plans, programs and budget, integrated mission advocacy, and management of decision-maker capabilities.  NMO\u2019s objective is to ensure capabilities are in place to provide complete and timely situational awareness and decision tools for senior decision-makers.  Additionally, the NMO assists the DoD CIO as the Executive Agent and primary OSD advocate for the White House Military Office with oversight of a wide range of DoD command, control, and communications (C3) assets and oversees the efforts of the Services and Agencies in the design, integration, and deployment of critical and sensitive C3 capabilities.  Two overall areas of focus include: 1) National Senior Leader C3 Systems, National Security\/Emergency Preparedness (NS\/EP), DoD support to Civil Authorities; Continuity of Government (COG); 2) Cyber Mission Indications and Warnings.\n\nNMO provides guidance, oversight and policy direction support for Senior Leadership communications and Continuity communications which enable the National Security Strategy's \"build a more lethal force\" line of effort.  By coordinating and integrating with the National Security Agency in the development of a security policy that provides guidance to the NMO community on cyber secure connection interfaces and security patterns on a continuous basis to addresses hardware, firmware and software vulnerabilities.  Working with DISA, the Services, and other federal government agencies to ensure the safety of our Nation's critical undersea cable infrastructure.  Provide guidance and oversight to all NMO cryptographic modernization programs, ensure NSA and the appropriate Service delivers their cryptographic capability on time and work with the combatant commanders' staff to ensure they have operationalized any potential risks with potential cryptographic program delays.\n\nCoordinate the DoD's critical time dissemination resiliency plans and initiatives with senior representatives from the precision, navigation and timing (PNT) community.  Work with the Joint Staff, Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps to ensure their PNT plans include primary and alternate capabilities.  Continue analysis of White House, DoD Services, DoD Agencies and Combatant Command initiatives to ensure the effectiveness of our airborne command, control and communications, commercial and military satellite communications, and their supporting ground infrastructure.  Analysis will ensure our Senior Leadership C3 is operationally effective during all phases of a conflict."

This will provide the department with a single repository of DCI and AT data to perform analysis and manage risk perf DODD 3020.40.     The development focus in FY19 will be on the development and implementation of the Mission Assurance Workspace and Viewer on SIPRNet and JWICS.   The MA Workspace and Viewer will provide the department\u2019s leadership with a consolidated MA dashboard, and analytical capabilities to perform planning and analysis of Mission Assurance activities per DoDD 3020.40 and 3020.45."

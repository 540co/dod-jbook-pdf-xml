            "val": "The Weapons Technology Program Element develops and tests a high-powered directed energy laser to build the foundation of the next-generation laser system on a high altitude unmanned airborne platform. The MDA's High Energy Laser (HEL) investment incrementally develops scalable, efficient, and compact HEL technology in the laboratory before beginning a high power laser flight test program.  The technology required for tracking the target, aiming the laser, and building flight demonstrators is developed under the TMI PE (0604115C).\n\nMDA collaborates with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HELJTO), and the Air Force in a systems engineering based strategy to research, develop and test directed energy weapons technology.  MDA is developing a set of common core technology that will enable both missile defense and air dominance missions. These core technologies include fiber launchers; high brightness, high efficiency diode pump modules; and high power, high efficiency fiber amplifiers.  In FY 2017, MDA, DARPA and the Air Force will complete a 30 kilowatt packaged Fiber Combined Laser (FCL) system at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory.  The system consists of the laser, batteries and thermal device. MDA will also upgrade the Diode Pumped Alkali Laser (DPAL) testbed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to conduct a 30 kilowatt demonstration with improved beam quality. In FY 2018, MDA will complete these final milestones and conclude the FFRDC laboratory high-powered directed energy laser activity.  \n\nThe Agency will make the directed energy technology developed under this PE available to industry for incorporation into the Low Power Laser Demonstrator and for further laser scaling development to power levels required for robust, speed of light missile defense.\n\nThe Common Kill Vehicle Technology PE 0603294C will address any future technology investments in Solid Divert and Attitude Control System (SDACS) beginning in FY 2018."

Using Directed Energy weapons to negate a ballistic missile in boost phase, before a threat missile can deploy countermeasures, will revolutionize missile defense by dramatically reducing the role of interceptors.  In FY 2010, the Airborne Laser program proved it is possible to acquire, track and destroy a boosting missile, addressing many aspects of the boost phase kill, but also underscoring the complexity and challenges of fielding such a weapon system.  The experience gained from that successful first foray into directed energy system illuminates a new path that integrates a highly efficient, compact electric laser into a high altitude, low-Mach Unmanned Aerial Vehicle capable of flying in the stratosphere.  Flying at low speed in relatively calm air at 60,000 feet significantly reduces the need for the complex beam pointing and atmospheric jitter compensation systems that were challenges for the Airborne Laser program.  The key to realizing this future high altitude, unmanned directed energy system is the laser.\n \nThe Directed Energy Research project funds the laboratory development of two high energy laser technologies, the DPAL with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and FCL with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (MIT\/LL).  Both laser technologies have considerable promise for scaling to very high average power while simultaneously achieving high system electrical-to-optical efficiencies, exceeding 40 percent, and very low system weight and volume.\n\nThe MDA strategy is to reduce technical risk through dual path laboratory development and transition the laboratory development to industry in FY 2018 for high altitude unmanned platform integration and test."

LLNL successfully demonstrated over 16 kilowatts (kW) in FY 2016; will demonstrate 30 kWs in FY 2018.\n\nMDA's key fiber laser investments are targeted at driving the weight per kilowatt of power in the fiber amplifier system down while increasing the individual fiber amplifier power output.  MDA joined with DARPA and the Air Force to demonstrate 44 kWs in a room-sized, 40 kilogram per kilowatt configuration in FY 2015, to a packaged 7 kilograms per kilowatt 30 kW system in FY 2018.\nSpecific and\/or unique accomplishments to each FY are as follows:"

Technology investment focused on DACS subsystem and system elements that support longer operation, multiple discrete DACS firing events, precision attitude control, safe operation and minimum kill vehicle mass.  In FY 2017, MDA continued investment in a competitive next generation solid DACS development with industry to reduce propulsion component risk for the MOKV.  The concept(s) developed for MOKV application transitioned to implementation with the industry MOKV developers.  MDA continued to conduct testing of lightweight, long duration Cooled Gas and Multi-Pulse Attitude Control Systems having application to both a Kill Vehicle and a Third Stage Rocket Motor, while anchoring system sizing and performance prediction models.  MDA defined the baseline requirements using analytical tools to identify mature technology capable of supporting MOKV development.\n\nThe project also modeled and assessed electromagnetic rail gun projectile technology readiness, suitability, and integration requirements for ballistic missile defense applications."

This provides integrity and oversight of the BMDS as well as supports MDA in the development and evaluation of technologies that will respond to the changing threat. Additionally, PWS includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation, and provides facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations.  Other MDA wide costs includes:  physical and technical security; civilian drug testing; audit readiness; the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program; legal services and settlements; travel and agency training; office, equipment, vehicle, and warehouse leases; utilities and base operations; data and unified communications support; supplies and maintenance; materiel and readiness and central property management of equipment; and similar operating expenses. PWS is allocated on a pro-rata basis and therefore, fluctuates by year based on the adjusted RDT&E profile (which excludes: 0305103C Cyber Security Initiative, 0603274C Special Programs, 0603913C Israeli Cooperative Program and 0901598C Management Headquarters)."

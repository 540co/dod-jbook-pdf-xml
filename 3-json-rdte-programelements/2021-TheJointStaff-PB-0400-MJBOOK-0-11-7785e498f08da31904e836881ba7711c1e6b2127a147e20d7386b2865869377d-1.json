Accordingly, the Joint Staff requires an experimentation capability to analyze and validate priority joint concept required capabilities. \n\nConcept analysis and validation will have a multi-faceted nature to meet the Chairmen\u2019s Title 10 responsibility of, \u201cidentifying new joint military capabilities based on advances in technology and concepts of operation, and recommending investments and experiments in such capabilities.\u201d Wargames will assess baseline mission and campaign level outcomes of the concepts as well as identify a tradespace of potential new capabilities. This tradespace of capabilities is further explored with quantitative models and software that identify the most efficient cost and capability tradeoffs to help meet the Title 10 responsibility of \u201cadvising the Secretary on new and alternative joint military capabilities, and alternative program recommendations and budget proposals, within projected resource levels.\u201d \n\nThe National Defense Strategy directs \u201cearly design tradeoffs in the requirements process to increase the speed of delivery.\u201d The Joint Staff approach to tradespace exploration follows that guidance by providing a cost conscious and operationally relevant prioritization tradeoff technique early in the portfolio design process. Using this rigorous prioritization approach, the capability development cycle can efficiently focus resources on more detailed experimentation of specific capabilities to inform the requirements process. The analysis from the experimentation program will be used to provide foundational evidence to directly inform the Joint Military Net Assessment (JMNA), the Chairman\u2019s Program Recommendation (CPR), and ultimately the Defense Planning Guidance for Joint Force development and design."

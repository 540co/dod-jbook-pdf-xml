            "val": "The Advanced Technology and Sensors (ATS) program coordinates the development of advanced technologies (sensors, data links, targeting networks and products, and quick reaction capabilities) in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned. Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly transition advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for remotely piloted aircraft. This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The ATS program also increases interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.\n\nThe funds in this project are distributed in priority order for the goal of building a comprehensive Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and on the results of the Airborne Sensors for ISR Analysis of Alternatives, as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year.  The program office has the ability to initiate an I&TS project, within the GEOINT Capabilities Working Group (GCWG) construct but outside the normal annual GCWG vetting process, to expedite development and acquisition of urgently needed capabilities for the warfighter. \n\nFunds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards (e.g. Open Mission Systems (OMS), Sensor Open System Architecture (SOSA), Common Open Architecture Reconnaissance Processor Standard (COARPS), AgilePod and data reduction) and interfaces.\n\nThe funds in this project are distributed in priority order for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT\/Multi-INT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and on the results of the Airborne Sensors for ISR Analysis of Alternatives, as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. The program office has the ability to initiate an I&TS project outside of the normal GCWG process to support rapid development, demonstration and\/or acquisition of urgently needed capabilities.\n\nTraditional focus areas include, but are not limited to: development, demonstration, and rapid transition of common radar and EO sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Low Frequency SAR, antenna, Infrared (IR), Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI), Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) and their operational modes (high resolution imagery, Ground and Dismount Moving Target Indicator (GMTI\/DMTI), persistent surveillance, wide area motion imagery, Spectral Identification) for multiple airborne platforms at all altitudes; development and demonstration of advanced tactical sensor and associated tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination processing algorithms and tools (automatic registration, automatic and assisted target detection, network centric warfare, etc); development of integrated multi-sensor capabilities to detect and identify obscured targets; development and implementation of standards (Common GMTI\/DMTI, National Imagery Transmission Format; and monitoring and enhancement of Imagery Intelligence product quality (radar and EO\/IR imagery, GMTI data, and spectral information) and timeliness throughout the image chain (from sensor to user); and development and integration of airborne sensors to support an open stems architecture pod capability. These efforts focus on reducing the find, fix and track elements of the time critical targeting kill-chain timeline while improving operator and decision-maker efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F."

The program acts as a replacement for the sense and avoid capability of the pilot on board a manned aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force is pursuing a software intensive approach to maintain safe separation, avoid collisions, and provide the ability to safely integrate with other airspace users. The software solutions identified in this Information System Capability Development Document (IS-CDD) are open and modular and accept inputs from any type of sensor or data link and will operate any legacy and future Group 4 and 5 RPA. The effort includes technology maturation, risk reduction, EMD and life-cycle costs, such as: 1) prototyping activities, 2) agile development, test and implementation of the software, 3) development of open system architecture using modular design, standards-based interfaces, and widely-supported consensus-based standards, and 4) collaboration with the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other services to develop national policy and standards.\n\nThe program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F,0605898F, and 0605833F."

The effort develops, tests, and will implement new sensor data compression and decompression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors. Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression capabilities for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, and Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). Outputs will meet standard certification for use within the Department of Defense GEOINT and Measurement and Signatures Intelligence(MASINT) architectures.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F."

The effort will develop, test and implement new sensor data compression and decompression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors. Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression capabilities for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, and the DCGS. Outputs will meet standard certification for use within the Department of Defense GEOINT and MASINT architectures."

            "val": "The program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for electro-optical sensors, radar sensors and electronic counter-countermeasures, and components and algorithms. It also develops and demonstrates radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) sensors for detecting, locating, and targeting airborne, fixed, and time-critical mobile ground targets obscured by natural or man-made means. This program develops the means to find, fix, target, track, and engage air and ground targets anytime, anywhere, and in any weather. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603203F, Advanced Aerospace Sensors, and associated Projects will be transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio. \n \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It provides aerospace platforms with the capability to precisely detect, track, and target both airborne (conventional and low radar cross-section) and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets in adverse clutter and jamming environments.  Project activities include developing multi-function radio-frequency systems including radar and electronic warfare technology and the position and timing information to enable distributed sensing.  Desired warfighting capabilities include the ability to detect concealed targets in difficult background conditions.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project  63665A, Advanced Aerospace Sensors Technology, will be transferred to Program Element 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, Project 63665A, Advanced Aerospace Sensors Technology, as part of the Air Force Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

This project also conducts advanced investigations to determine solution credibility, in terms of underlying technology and in terms of consistency with future Air Force missions within highly contested environments.  This project includes robust techniques to support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and targeting missions within adverse weather conditions and against adversaries employing deceptive techniques.  This project includes development of software-intensive solutions suitable for cloud-based integration and for development\/operations-like operational environments.  This project develops technology for effective management of online and offline information sources incorporating both constrained and cooperative sensing. This project has been realigned to better reflect technical areas being emphasized such as autonomy, multi-domain and multi-sensor information processing, leverage of machine learning developments and enterprise-level modeling, simulation and analysis.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 6369DF, Target Attack and Recognition Technology will be transferred to Program Element 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, Project 6369DF, Target Attack and Recognition Technology, as part of the Air Force Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

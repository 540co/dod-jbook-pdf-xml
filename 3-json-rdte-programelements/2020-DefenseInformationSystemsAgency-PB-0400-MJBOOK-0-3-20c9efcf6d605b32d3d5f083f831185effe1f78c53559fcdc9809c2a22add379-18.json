DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. \n\nDCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.

The T&E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team's State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time.\n\nThe T&E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity. Of the six DCGS PoR systems, two hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, & Computers\/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases. One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending. Of the three remaining PoRs, two are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events. Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year.\n\n1.

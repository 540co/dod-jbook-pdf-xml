            "val": "The Technology Transfer Program captures and manages all intellectual property (patents and inventions) developed by the Air Force and leads efforts to transfer the intellectual property to commercial sector for the production and transition of the technology to the warfighter.  \n\nTechLink, Department of Defense's (DoD)'s first National level Partnership Intermediary, directly supports these activities for all Air Force, Army, Navy, and independent DoD Research Laboratories. TechLink brokers technology transfer agreements between DoD laboratories and US industry for the manufacture and use of DoD inventions.  These agreements enable DoD to leverage the investment and capabilities of the private-sector in development of new defense-related products and services, lowering DoD costs and also helping ensure that DoD-developed or co-developed technologies are transitioned to DoD operational use.  This program impacts virtually all technology fields, including medicine, software, electronics, communications, advanced materials, and energy-related technologies.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Technology Transfer capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nIn FY 2021, all efforts and civilian manpower under Project 646030, AFWERX, will be transferred to the Air Force Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation, Budget Activity (BA-04), Administration and Service-wide Activities, for proper execution of AFWERX activities.\n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $0.130 million to account for availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Both of these activities enable DoD to leverage the investment and capabilities of the private-sector in development of new defense-related products and services, lowering DoD costs and also helping ensure that DoD-developed or co-developed technologies are transitioned to DoD operational use."

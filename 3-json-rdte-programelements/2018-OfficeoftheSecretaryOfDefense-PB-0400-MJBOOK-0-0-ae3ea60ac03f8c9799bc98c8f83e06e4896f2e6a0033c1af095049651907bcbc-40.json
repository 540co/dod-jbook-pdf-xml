This effort measures the effectiveness of new architectures and revolutionary concepts against evolving threats by working with the IC, Combatant Commands, government labs, program offices, industry, and academia. \n\nTo meet this challenge the Missile Defeat Project leverages existing test and simulated environments to perform analysis of industry and government reference concepts and architectures to provide innovative technical solutions for missile defeat. We are developing virtual and physical testbeds to robustly test, evaluate, and prototype architectures and assess their ability to improve time critical targeting and defeat of road-mobile threats. The virtual testbed complements testing at physical ranges by providing an infrastructure for addressing different training, test, and evaluation needs. This effort also includes systems engineering and analysis to devolve technical requirements, identify promising solutions, and inform future investment decisions."

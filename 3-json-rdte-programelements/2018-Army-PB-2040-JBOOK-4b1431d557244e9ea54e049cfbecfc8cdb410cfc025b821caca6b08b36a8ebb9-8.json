OTC consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives. Sustainment funding maintains existing testing capabilities at all locations by replacing unreliable, uneconomical, and irreparable instrumentation, as well as incremental upgrades of hardware and software for M&S and instrumentation systems to assure adequate test data collection capabilities. This data supports acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army including programs such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Advanced Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV),  Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Patriot Advance Capability Phase 3 (PAC-3), Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T), Stryker, Bradley, Abrams, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS),and the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A)."

Where practical, efficiencies will be gained through the common use of developmental instrumentation in operational testing.  A key element is sustaining aging instrumentation which maintains existing capabilities at test facilities by replacing unreliable, uneconomical and irreparable instrumentation, as well as lifecycle replacement and incremental upgrades of instrumentation and software, reducing their average age to assure adequate testing capabilities. This Project develops and sustains developmental test instrumentation and capabilities that provide the data necessary to support acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army. Significant examples include new instrumentation for the testing of Command, Control, Communication and Computer (C4) systems, upgrades to existing radars to extend their economic life, common data collection and analysis tools, non-intrusive instrumentation to test Unmanned Ground Vehicles and sensors, high speed - high definition digital imaging systems to capture missile flight events, and automation software to improve data collection of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing."

This refurbishment replaced obsolete equipment that has been in use for the past 40 years to extend the life of the amplifiers.  The Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) continued their development of a complete test capability to support high volume, high-speed production\/acceptance test capability for body armor and vehicle armor plates.  The ATC also continued the improvement and development of methodology for capturing crew survivability data during live fire and fire suppression testing for combat vehicle programs.  Instrumentation, transducers, and other sensing technologies are being developed to measure parameters which my result in crew injuries.  At the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), instrumentation was developed to increase the capability to test C4ISR tactical networks in support of developmental testing.  The new equipment ensures compliance with customer requirements for speed, capacity, and reliability.  At the White Sands Test Center (WSTC), provided funding to replace obsolete components for existing FPS-16 Monopulse Tracking Radar systems supporting missile defense programs.  The WSTC also acquired the excessed Multiple Object Tracking Radar \u2013 4 (MOTR-4) from Vandenberg Air Force Base to replace two degraded FPS-16s.  At the Yuma Test Center (YTC), a usability life extension effort for the Close-In radar systems (Continuous Wave Doppler\/Pulse Systems) was begun to mitigate obsolescence and a lack of available components from industry.  This effort will result in extended operational capabilities that are supported by the manufacturer with enhancements to support smart munitions."

The WSTC will complete the development of a secure wireless network to provide internet protocol data and communication connectivity to the Test Support Network (TSN) from \u201cunwired\u201d areas of the test range.  The YTC will replace tape video recorders with hard drive based video recorders due to obsolescence of the technology.  This effort will include procurement of high definition cameras to support missions throughout the range.  The RTC will design, procure, develop, and integrate an end-to-end mobile system to measure the performance of couter-unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) systems under test.  The ATC will develop a common methodology and technology for collection of analog data to support the next generation of instrumentation used for ballistics analysis and automotive instrumentation.  This common methodology will provide a more efficient use of resources and broaden a common understanding of these measurements for evaluator across the command.  The EPG will develop a test data management and control system to provide test personnel and evaluators cloud-like, secure access of current and prior test data allowing for quick analysis and review."

Operational Test (OT) Instrumentation collects required data from systems under test and the systems which they integrate with to  support effectiveness, survivability, and suitability analysis; these systems also provide real-time position location and status tracking to support test control. The Army's Operations Tempo (OPTEMPO) has reduced the number of tactical units and vehicles available to support OT, making enhancement of live forces through simulation essential for testing in a realistic, operational environment by simulating tactical engagements, additional units, message traffic, effects, and terrain. ATEC OT Modeling, Simulation and Instrumentation (MS&I) funding is used to adapt capabilities from other organizations (including within ATEC), purchase off-the-shelf systems, and develop and sustain OT-unique simulation and instrumentation systems. As required, the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) provides development and integration of major simulation and instrumentation systems. The MS&I (Sustainment and Minor Development) program funds the expertise and the adaptation, purchases, minor development and sustainment requirements that support systems undergoing OT. Costs unique to specific systems under test may require Program Manager (PM) funding."

The M1A1 tank provides armor-protected mobile firepower to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).   Efforts under the mod line pertaining to the M1A1 include improvements such as:  lethality systems, to increase armament accuracy and provide for off-board targeting improvement; survivability systems (including passive and active); communications and command and control; mobility; increasing the crew's situational awareness through sensor enhancements and intra-vehicular data sharing; and environmental testing of components.  The AVLB provides the Marine Corps only armor-protected assault gap crossing capability.  Continued funding is required to address obsolescence and address operational deficiencies to adapt the tank and AVLB to a changing operational environment and support user-defined product improvements.   Funding also supports items such as miscellaneous tools and test items for the M1A1 tank and associated supporting platforms, safety and sustainment modifications to the bridge launcher, and Materiel Fielding Support.\n\nThe Engineer Mods and Tool Kits line funds modifications and initiatives which are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, product quality deficiencies and other issues that affect vehicle reliability, availability and readiness.  This approach ensures proper vehicle sustainment and life cycle management in response to evolving needs of the Marine Corps fleet.  Operational needs to provide personnel survivability on engineer equipment is essential to current and future operations.  Research and development funding develops and integrates new lighter, compact armor technology and supports ballistic testing for applications to existing and future acquisitions.    \n\nCorrosion Prevention and Control (CPAC): The useful life of Marine Corps assets will be extended through a comprehensive CPAC RDT&E program aimed at identifying and certifying new corrosion control products, materials, processes and procedures for legacy and new acquisition. The CPAC RDT&E Program works to standardize and substantially improve strategies, objectives and processes to prevent, detect, and treat corrosion and its effects on Marine Corps ground vehicles and weapons systems. This mission responds to the Congressional directives and DoD and SECNAV instruction to reduce the negative operational effects and associated total ownership cost of Marine Corps ground vehicles and weapons systems.\n\nThe Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV) provides tactical mobility for Warfighters with multi-mission vehicles designed to support urgent operational needs and protect personnel from the effects of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), underbody mines, and small arms fire threats.  Multiple vehicle categories (CATs) have been procured, fielded, and sustained: MRAP All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) - Combat Operations (ops) in rural, mountainous, urban terrain.  Category I - Urban combat operations, ambulance. Category II - Multi-mission ops-convoy lead, troop transport, ambulance, utility vehicle. Category III - Mine\/IED clearance ops, explosive ordnance disposal.  Operational needs to provide personnel survivability is essential to current and future operations.  Research and development funding develops and integrates support efforts such as ballistic glass or other safety issues, new armor technology and ballistic testing."

A sustained effort is maintained in the Marine Corps for development and testing in support of fleet Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) initiatives, vehicle quality deficiency resolutions, safety initiatives, environmental\/state transportation mandated vehicle changes, and system component refresh modifications efforts to include addressing deficiencies of HMMWV vehicles due to up armoring and age degradation of the fleet. Since transportation asset operational availability declines at a steady rate over time, SLEP, fleet overhauls, and enhanced depot level modifications are essential in maintaining a viable transportation capability in the Marine Corps Operating Forces.\n\nThe M88A2 Modification program funds research, development and testing of improvements in all areas of the M88A2 HERCULES vehicle, which provides the MAGTF heavy combat recovery capability. Funding addresses obsolescence and Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to improve performance and develop safety related ECPs to correct hazards noted during the standard day to day operation of the M88A2 Improved Recovery Vehicle. \n\nThe HMMWV Sustainment Modification Initiative (SMI) program was cancelled effective FY 2016.  FY 2015 funding supported engineering studies and analysis to evaluate the vehicle performance, safety and reliability. This program does not have funding beyond the FY15 HMMWV project. Future Legacy HMMWV safety and reliability efforts will be funded as a part of the Motor Transport Modification project 2509.  \n\nP-19 Replacement (P-19R) is replacing the obsolete A\/S32P-19A Crash Fire Rescue fleet in support of expeditionary airfield operations and the supporting establishment. The vehicle is outfitted with advanced fire suppression equipment and provide rescue and aircraft fire fighting capabilities to permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps. The P-19 Replacement may also be employed to fight structural fires in support of base camps and as firefighting support to other elements of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), such as ammunition supply points, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) distribution points, or hazardous material storage facilities.\n\nThe Family of Trailers & Ancillary Equipment program will explore options for \"lightening the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)\" weight and cube attributes of the light and medium\/heavy trailer fleet.  Seeking technologies and other current and emerging options that can be employed to achieve optimum lift capability while constrained to the desired weight and cube.  Transportation and expeditionary goals will be considered in the research and development phase for the trailer fleet.

These systems provide required heating, cooling, storage, and servicing for systems throughout the Marine Corps. Current efforts seek to replace all legacy ECUs with systems of higher reliability and higher efficiency using EPA-approved refrigerants, more energy efficient enhanced mobility, easier to repair, and quieter than their predecessors. With environmental control systems consuming 50-70% of tactical electric power in theater, this savings will be a significant contribution to reducing the USMC fuel demand, and lightening the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). The Warfighter benefit includes a decreased logistics footprint, less reliance on petroleum-derived fuels, increased local energy security, and reduced tanker losses (fewer on the road). The operational imperative to reduce fuel usage will consequently reduce refueling operations and exposing Marines to hazardous fuel convoy operations.\nEfforts such as research, development, integration testing of\n(1) Field Refrigeration Systems (FRS) Refrigerant Unit (RU) replacement. This effort seeks to replace legacy RUs in current USMC Large and Small FRSs complying with EPA regulations while increasing efficiency thus reducing overall power requirements\/demands.\n(2) The Enhanced Environmental Control Unit (E2CU) program is the second generation of a family of environmental control units from 9,000 BTU to 60,000 BTU\/Hr cooling output. The E2CU program will provide tactical Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and superior reliability for all MAGTF units in all operational concepts. E2CU will have significant average fuel efficiency improvements over the current ECU family has been demonstrated while complying with newer EPA regulations on refrigerants.\n\n\nMobile Power Equipment:\nThe Family of Mobile Electric Power Equipment consists of command and control systems for power management and distribution (intelligent power management), tactical generators ranging from 2 to 200 kilowatts, power distribution systems, energy storage systems, load banks, floodlights, cabling, and electrician tool kits. This equipment is to procure, field, manage and provide electricity on the battlefield. Systems may be mounted on prime movers, skids or trailers. Systems support maneuver, combat support, and combat service support units requiring tactical power to operate weapons systems, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems, medical and messing facilities, environmental control equipment, and water purification systems. With over 10,000 generators and using diesel engines in the Operating Forces, improving their fuel efficiency and reliability will be a significant contribution to reducing the USMC fuel demand, and lightening the MAGTF. The Warfighter benefit includes a decreased logistics footprint, less reliance on petroleum derived fuels, increased local energy security, and reduced tanker losses (fewer on the road). The operational imperative to reduce fuel usage will consequently reduce refueling operations and exposing Marines to hazardous fuel convoy operations.\n\nEfforts encompass research, development, integration, and testing of the following items:\n(1) Intelligent Power Management Systems (IPMS) which support a robust, scalable solution to interconnect, control, store and distribute power from various sources. As a result, the power requirements will be met in a more efficient manner thus reducing fuel consumption. The IPMS will use multiple electrical inputs from military generators, vehicles and renewable sources. Subsystems include Digital Control System (DCS), Energy Storage Unit (ESU), and Intelligent Power Distribution System (IPD).\n(2) Large Advanced Power Sources (LAMPS) procurement of newer more fuel efficient large format generators (100-200kw) replacing the legacy generators and ensuring commonality with the Army large format generators.\n\n\nAdvanced Power Sources:\nThe Advanced Power Sources (APS) efforts will focus on achieving the Marine Corps goal of lightening the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) through reduced logistical fuel resupply needs. The Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Source (MEHPS) Capability Development Document (CDD) addresses the USMC Expeditionary Water and Waste (E2W2) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and supports the MAGTF intent to: travel lighter and faster, use less fuel, depend less on the supply chain; and reduce energy production, storage, and distribution requirements. This CDD addresses the Operational Energy (OE) ICD identifying the power and energy criticalities to the Joint Force. The Mobile Electric Hybrid Power System (MEHPS) will focus on hybrid power systems capable of improved fuel efficiency and silent operations in the 0.5-5kW and 10-15kW power range. These systems will be smaller, lighter and more efficient systems that reduce the demand for fossil fuels, extending the Commander's operational reach. These efforts will transition into production of systems that integrate with the Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG), Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS), and future generator sets. The Battery Maintenance and Storage Shelter effort will focus on developing a modular solution to store and maintain a variety of battery form factors and chemistries.  This will provide an environmentally protected, deployable battery maintenance and storage shelter with the capability to maintain and condition deployable batteries that will significantly decrease O&M costs to the Fleet by extending the life of fielded batteries."

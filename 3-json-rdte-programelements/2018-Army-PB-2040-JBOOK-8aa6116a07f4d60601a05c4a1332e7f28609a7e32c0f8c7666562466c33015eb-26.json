            "val": "Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary all-weather, surface-to-surface long-range artillery precision guided missile used by Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard & soft targets in open, complex, and urban environments. \n\n788: ATACMS Product Improvement Program (PIP) focuses on safety, cost reduction, reliability, deficiency corrections, standardization, and new or improved operational capabilities. FY18 Base funds in the amount of $5.000 million supports operational testing, corrections of identified deficiencies, and fielding support activities for a Height-of-Burst capability via proximity sensor. \n\nDZ9: ATACMS Mods effort will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory. Block (BLK) I\/IA ATACMS currently have warheads that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). Starting with a BLK I\/IA missile, this modification effort will integrate, test, and qualify an ATACMS configuration to include a policy compliant warhead, obsolescence refresh, and re-grained rocket motors. Performance of a characterization effort will include qualification and flight testing to assess ATACMS performance with inclusion of a proximity sensor. Additional efforts include launcher updates to enable firing of the new ATACMS configuration. There is no FY18 funding.\n\nVT9: Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) develops, integrates, and tests the Switchblade Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL).  Multi-Pack Launcher provides the capability to launch up to 6 Switchblade missiles remotely in a Force Protection Environment. The mission for the MPL is to be placed in a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in a constant ready-to-use state to enable Soldiers to remain in the safety of a building while launching Switchblade missiles.  There is no FY18 funding. \n\n045:  Hellfire Prod Imp Prog integrates the Longbow 7A missile, which provides increased seeker capability to acquire and attack a wider variety of targets, and integrates a blast fragmentation sleeve and proximity fuse to increase lethality onto the MQ-1 Gray Eagle Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  In addition, this program supports the integration with missile technical and software support from both the Federal government and the Longbow prime contractor and the upgrade of a limited number of Longbow missiles for integration testing.  There is no FY18 funding."

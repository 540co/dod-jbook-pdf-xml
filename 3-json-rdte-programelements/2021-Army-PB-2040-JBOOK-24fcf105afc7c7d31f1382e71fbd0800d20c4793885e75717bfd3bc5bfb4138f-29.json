Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to continue to develop and modernize the platform to meet Army and DoD policy-driven cloud computing and cybersecurity requirements. Prior to funding being committed, DoD ESOH stakeholders and authoritative information technology organizations were consulted to determine necessary system interface upgrades to be incorporated. Expanding DENIX's architecture to create a Level 2 container separate from the current Level 4 container will not only provide a more secure, cybersecurity risk-adverse environment, but it will also optimize performance, capabilities, and mandatory reporting for ESOH stakeholders using a PaaS delivery model. This phased solution begins in FY 2018 by prototyping of system architecture optimization that improves user experience, enabling web conferencing in FY 2019 and applying machine learning concepts to improve data quality in FY 2020-2022."

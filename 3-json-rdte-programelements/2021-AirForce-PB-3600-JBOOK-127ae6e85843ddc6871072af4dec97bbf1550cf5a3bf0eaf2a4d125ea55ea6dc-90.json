            "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1206442F, Next Generation OPIR efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1206442SF, Next Generation OPIR from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 05 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) RDT&E FY 2021 budget justification exhibits describe the Next-Gen OPIR Space, Ground, and Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) programs.\n\n1. Next-Gen OPIR Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) (Project 657009): SMI supports Next-Gen OPIR by assessing and demonstrating new technologies better enabling the detection of emerging global missile threats, material obsolescence, designing space and ground modifications focused on affordability and capability,and maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements, and technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for space and ground architecture enhancements. SMI includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current Program of Record (PoR) constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded trade space and improve the competitive\nenvironment. The three major thrust areas under SMI are Demonstrations, Technology Maturation and Data Exploitation. The Demonstrations mature and demonstrate technologies with ground and on-orbit prototypes. Demonstrations advance system performance and algorithms for tactical and strategic applications to enhance PoR capabilities. Finally, demonstrations reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the current PoR. Technology Maturation assesses and addresses needs to support resiliency of PoR assets and future architectures that must respond to an evolving threat environment. Data Exploitation enables access to OPIR data sources to expand technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to support warfighters and other data users.\n\n2. Next-Gen OPIR Ground (Project 657106): Next-Gen OPIR Ground, also known as Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE), will consist of Command and Control (C2) migration to Air Force Space Command's (AFSPC) Enterprise Ground Services (EGS), modernization of Mission Data Processing (MDP) to implement an open framework, and required development and\/or upgrades to Relay Ground Stations (RGS) to meet AFSPC guidance on the current and future space domain demands. FORGE and EGS efforts combined will provide the flexibility and scalability to integrate new satellites, sensors and capabilities more rapidly and efficiently in order to meet evolving threats and warfighter needs. The Next-Gen OPIR ground efforts enable cyber enhancements for both space and ground systems.\nEGS will introduce common ground services such as Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C), mission management, and automation. To support initial Next-Gen OPIR Space satellite launches without driving risks into the FORGE development schedule, the program will establish a risk reduction ground Next-Gen OPIR Interim Operations (NIO) capability based on a limited SBIRS Block 20 solution that can be utilized if FORGE becomes delayed.\n\n3. Next-Gen OPIR Space: Is a transition from the legacy SBIRS program. Next-Gen OPIR implements the direction of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 130-17, dated 21 December 2017, by developing the next generation of strategically survivable space-based missile warning OPIR platforms in both GEO and Polar orbits. This program will deliver improved core missile warning capabilities that are more survivable against emerging threats. The full Next-Gen OPIR constellation will consist of a minimum of GEO and Polar satellites in sufficient number to meet global warning coverage with no exploitable holes (5 GEO + 2 Polar) plus required backup and attrition and reconstitution reserve. The Air Force intends to acquire Next-Gen systems in block procurements. The Block 0 acquisition strategy consists of three GEO and two Polar satellites. The first GEO satellite is required no later than FY 2025 and the first Polar satellite is required in FY2027. All five Block 0 satellites need to be on orbit by FY2029. Follow-on blocks will be addressed in future acquisition strategies. Next-Gen OPIR Space, Block 0 Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO)(NGG) (Project 657120): The Program Office intends to acquire the NGG capability in two contract actions. Phase 1 was awarded in August 2018 and encompasses requirements analysis, design\/development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System CDR. Phase 2 will be awarded in FY2021 for the manufacturing, assembly, system integration and test, launch and early on-orbit test through the delivery of NGG satellites 1-3 for operational acceptance of each space vehicle.\n\nNext-Gen OPIR Space, Block 0 Polar (NGP) (Project 657121): The Program Office intends to acquire the NGP capability in three contract actions. Phase 0 awarded in June 2018, encompassing system and payload requirements analysis and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Requirements Review. Phase 1 will be awarded for design and development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System CDR. Phase 2 will be awarded for the manufacturing,\nassembly, integration and test, and delivery of NGP satellites 1&2.\n\nNext-Gen OPIR Space, Block 1 (Project 657122): The Air Force plans to acquire subsequent blocks in a competitive environment. The Block 1 satellites will be based on the Enterprise OPIR Capability Development Document (CDD), validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in May 2019. The Next Gen OPIR Block 1 program acquisition will begin in FY 2023 in time to deliver its first satellite by FY 2030. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop\nnew or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Next-Gen OPIR weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

Additionally, SMI supports space and ground design efforts focused on delivering affordable capabilities, maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing improvements, producibility enhancements, and technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for space and ground architecture enhancements. SMI includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current SBIRS Program of Record (PoR) constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded trade space and improve the competitive environment. The three major thrust areas under SMI are Demonstrations, Technology Maturation and Data Exploitation. The Demonstrations mature and demonstrate technologies with ground and on-orbit prototypes.  Demonstrations advance system performance and algorithms for tactical and strategic applications to enhance PoR capabilities.  Finally, demonstrations reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the current PoR. Technology Maturation assesses and addresses needs to support resiliency of PoR assets and future architectures that must respond to an evolving threat environment. Data Exploitation enables access to OPIR data sources to expand technical intelligence products, battlespace awareness processing, and data dissemination tools to support warfighters and other data users."

The demonstrations explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem\/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture. The demonstrations support maturation of Mission Data Processing (MDP) algorithms for tactical and strategic applications which are critical efforts to enhance PoR capabilities and to reduce program risks for future OPIR systems.\n\nThe Wide Field Of View (WFOV) demonstration matures WFOV technology and validates multi-mission capabilities including the potential for a single sensor to simultaneously perform strategic and tactical missions. WFOV is ready for launch in FY 2021. Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and reduce risk for future architectures. The WFOV payload and bus are separate development efforts. The WFOV testbed program provides a bus capable of demonstrating on-orbit mission performance and mitigating the development risks for employing WFOV sensors. The testbed program will integrate, test, and launch a prototype WFOV payload with a government-owned free-flyer spacecraft.  The WFOV testbed will host the WFOV payload. As an integrated Space Vehicle, the WFOV system will prove on-orbit mission performance of WFOV sensors. The WFOV payload will provide the critical on-orbit data required to develop and validate WFOV algorithms, as well as on-board MDP throughput requirements for strategic missile warning. \n\nThe Block 1 Prototype (space vehicle) is under development and will be responsive to emerging missile types and threats to the current missile warning architecture as well as evolving threats to the enterprise. The Block 1 Prototype will inform future OPIR architecture to include those achieved by the Space Force, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other mission partners. The Block 1 Prototype has a Class-C mission assurance with a 3-5 year designed mission life. The Block 1 Prototype is targeting an initial launch capability beginning in 2025. The technology demonstrations will incorporate resiliency capabilities while advancing the state of the art performance technology. The demonstrations will focus on the rapid advancement, technology insertion, and launch of future generations of missile warning technologies. These assets will incorporate threat mitigation technologies and other resiliency features with the goal of demonstrating these technologies in ground and on-orbit. These demonstrations will facilitate tech insertion, validate technical performance, inform future OPIR requirements, and reduce technical risk to the enterprise."

Activities, such as SBIRS obsolescence and affordability enhancements to the existing satellite design, will leverage existing Program of Record contracts. Technology maturation and component prototyping and\/or qualification could leverage existing contracts. Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) and Other Transaction Authorities are planned in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) and other government agencies. Where practical, other efforts are competed. An SMC BAA will be used to acquire and mature high priority technology items. Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contractors will also be used to conduct and support studies. New technology, replacement components, and system designs will be acquired with government data rights to the maximum extent, allowing incorporation into future OPIR satellite production or system development. Contracting partnerships with other agencies will also be used to study, develop, demonstrate, and prove emerging capabilities. Funding in execution years will be realigned within the Next-Gen OPIR program element to respond to execution requirements. To accelerate contracting actions and program execution, a local SMC contract vehicle will be utilized for the OPIR Battlespace Awareness Center (OBAC) and government lab services."

FORGE and EGS efforts combined will provide the flexibility and scalability to integrate new satellites, sensors and capabilities more rapidly and efficiently in order to meet evolving threats and warfighter needs. The Next-Gen OPIR ground efforts enable cyber enhancements for both space and ground systems. EGS will introduce common ground services such as Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C); mission management; and automation. To support initial Next-Gen OPIR Space satellite launches without driving risks into the FORGE development schedule, the program will establish a risk reduction ground Next-Gen OPIR Interim Operations (NIO) capability based on a limited Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Block 20 solution."

The Next-Gen OPIR GEO (NGG) missile warning satellites enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. Development consists of new payloads in a highly resilient bus, providing real-time persistent global infrared coverage to meet validated Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) requirements on current and future space domain demands.\n\nThe Program Office intends to acquire the NGG capability in two contract actions. Phase 1 awarded in August 2018 encompasses requirements analysis, design\/development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Critical Design Review (CDR). Phase 2 will be awarded in FY 2021 for the manufacturing, assembly, system integration and test, launch, and early on-orbit test through operational acceptance of  NGG satellites 1-3."

The first GEO satellite is required by FY 2025 and the first Polar satellite is required in FY 2027. All five Block 0 satellites need to be on orbit by FY 2029. The program office awarded two sole source contracts (one to a GEO prime and one to a Polar prime) under the authority of two Justification & Authorization documents. Next-Gen GEO Phase 1 was awarded in FY 2018, encompassing requirements analysis, design\/development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Critical Design Review for SV #1. Next-Gen GEO Phase 2 will be awarded in FY 2021 as a modification to the Phase 1 contract. This will include material buys for SV #2 and #3, as well as complete the manufacturing, assembly, system integration and test, launch, and early on-orbit test through the delivery of GEOs 1-3 for operational acceptance of each space vehicle. The Space Force plans to acquire subsequent blocks in a competitive environment. The Block 1 satellites will be based on the Missile Warning and Missile Defense OPIR Capability Development Document (CDD), validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in May 2019. Funding in execution years will be realigned within the Next-Gen OPIR program element to respond to execution requirements."

The first GEO satellite is required by FY2025, and the first Polar satellite is required in FY2027. All five Block 0 satellites need to be on orbit by FY2029. The program office awarded two sole source contracts (one to a GEO prime and one to a Polar prime) under the authority of two Justification & Authorization documents. The Next-Gen Polar Phase 0 was awarded in FY 2018, consisting of requirements development and culminates in a FY 2020 SRR. Phase 1 will be awarded in FY 2020, encompassing requirements review, design, development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System CDR for Next-Gen Polar Satellite Vehicles (SV) 1 and 2. Phase 2 will be awarded in FY 2022, encompassing build, integration, test, launch, and transition to operations for Next-Gen Polar SVs 1 and 2. The Space Force plans to acquire subsequent blocks in a competitive environment. The Block 1 satellites will be based on the Missile Warning and Missile Defense OPIR Capability Development Document (CDD), validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in May 2019. Funding in execution years will be realigned within the Next-Gen OPIR program element to respond to execution requirements."

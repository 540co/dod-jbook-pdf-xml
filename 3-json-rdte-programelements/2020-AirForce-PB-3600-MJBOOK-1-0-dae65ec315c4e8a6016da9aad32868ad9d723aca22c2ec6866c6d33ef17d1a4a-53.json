Air Force acquisition teams lead the upgrade and fielding of new equipment\/systems by assessing deficiencies in existing equipment, identifying and assessing existing products or developing new technology, and conducting required Safe-to-Fly tests, certifications, and studies. Program efforts include, but are not limited to, the following projects: directed energy protective equipment; flight helmets and visors; oxygen breathing systems for aircrew; radios and locator beacons; support equipment; nuclear flash blindness protection; night vision devices; noise reduction devices; anti-gravity (anti-G) suits; flame resistant, retardant and blast\/ballistic protective gear; aircraft seating; impact protection equipment; flotation devices; parachutes; ejection seats; physiological monitoring devices and other aircrew\/life support\/ground crew systems required by the warfighter. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Life Support capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

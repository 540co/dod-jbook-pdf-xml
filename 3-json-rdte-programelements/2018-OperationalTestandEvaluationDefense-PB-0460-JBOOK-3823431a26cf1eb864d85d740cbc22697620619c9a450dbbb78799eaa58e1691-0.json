Key elements of DOT&E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2016 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.  \n\nCybersecurity Evaluations\n\nDOT&E sponsored seven Combatant Command (CCMD) and two Service cybersecurity exercise assessments in FY 2016.  In addition to the nine exercise assessments, DOT&E performed two assessments during visits to operational sites not involved in an exercise.  All DOT&E-sponsored assessments included a \u201cfix\u201d phase during which DOT&E-funded cybersecurity experts helped CCMD and Service personnel address critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  As part of our new Cyber Readiness Campaigns (CRCs), DOT&E worked with U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. European Command, and U.S. Southern Command to evaluate a larger spectrum of cybersecurity related issues than is possible during a short exercise.  The CRCs included more frequent and focused assessment events, and they helped commands address persistent, mission-critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  To enable more threat-representative and longer-duration adversary portrayal, DOT&E initiated a Persistent Cyber Opposing Force (PCO) capability as part of U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s CRC as well as at U.S. Northern Command.  DOT&E worked with U.S. Cyber Command to expand the use of PCOs to better understand and address our network vulnerabilities, to be more threat representative, and to allow more efficient use of limited cyber red team assets.  To support cybersecurity assessments of live DoD networks, DOT&E conducted lab-based cyber testing of cross-domain solutions (CDSs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  These are critical components in many DoD systems and networks, and DOT&E\u2019s testing resulted in recommendations to improve CDS and PLC security and test procedures.   Using personnel with advanced cybersecurity expertise, DOT&E conducted evaluations of a small number of offensive cyber capabilities in direct support of the capabilities\u2019 sponsor.  DOT&E transmitted critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD\u2019s cybersecurity posture. DOT&E\u2019s FY 2016 cybersecurity evaluations included trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs."

Key elements of DOT&E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2017 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List. \n\nCybersecurity Evaluations \n\nDOT&E plans to sponsor approximately 10 CCMD and Service cybersecurity assessments and CRCs in FY 2017, each including a \u201cfix\u201d phase as described above.  DOT&E plans to continue working with the CCMDs and Services to develop multi-year plans for exercise cyber assessments and CRC events.  These plans will focus on assessing the CCMD or Service\u2019s ability to complete missions in a contested cyber environment.  To support threat-representative assessments, and to enable continuous improvement of DoD\u2019s cybersecurity posture, DOT&E will continue to work with U.S. Cyber Command to establish a PCO capability for all CCMDs and Services.  Primary objectives for DOT&E\u2019s assessments in FY 2017 include the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats and the assessment of operational missions during realistic cyber attacks.  DOT&E will assess Cyber Protection Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC or exercise events.  DOT&E will continue to develop techniques to efficiently and effectively assess offensive cyber capabilities, and conduct timely evaluations of these capabilities. DOT&E will use the DoD Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) and other lab and cyber range assets to support events, for added threat realism. DOT&E will transmit critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD\u2019s cybersecurity posture.   FY 2017 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs."

Pending CCMD and Service agreement, DOT&E plans to conduct CRC events with all of the CCMDs and Services.  Each CRC will include frequent assessments focused on new cybersecurity technologies or procedures to address problems identified in prior assessments. CRCs will culminate in a capstone event during a major exercise that evaluates the cybersecurity of critical missions, as improved by the new technologies and procedures.  Using the PCO, DOT&E will continue to work with the CCMDs and cyber red teams to increase the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats.  The goal is to have the majority of assessments in FY 2018 include advanced threats that stress critical missions.  DOT&E will assess Cyber Protection Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC or exercise events.

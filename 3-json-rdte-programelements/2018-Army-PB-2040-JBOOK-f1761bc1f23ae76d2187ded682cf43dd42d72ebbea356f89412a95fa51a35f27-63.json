The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  Army TENCAP facilitates the continued access to National Intel Community (IC) 'joint' efforts and compatibility with those National standards and software baseline for those Army PORs that benefit from these leveraged National IC technologies, resulting in cost-savings through cost-sharing, and Army participation in collaborative Intelligence. Funds will be used for final-stage integration efforts identified and vetted through the Army TENCAP annual TGOSG, such as advanced Air Vigilance software enhancements, POR sensor integration into the Theater Net-Centric Geolocation network, integration of the future AMDAS capability into PM DCGS-A family of systems and operational concepts, transition and integration of Army TENCAP technologies discovered and leveraged by the annual MERIT project selection process, as well as other transitioning technologies discovered and\/or leverage through other joint TENCAP outreach efforts."

The QRC was transitioned into an Army AIS POR by the AAE in May 2013 and assigned to Army Program Executive Office - Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEWS), the chartered acquisition authority for management and execution of the Army's TENCAP mission and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for the AV POR.  The Army TENCAP continues to leverage the IC common software development and support contract to field the AV systems, and ensure this primarily software based system can continue to access and leverage the common software, and input or ingest the latest sensor collects into the common IC data library.  As an AIS POR, the AV POR is currently fielding systems per its Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) and with software and system capabilities that meet its latest validated Capability Drop (CD) requirements.  The AV POR is currently scheduled to meet Full Deployment (FD) by 2020, and will continue to evolve to meet future validated Capability Drop requirements and maintain its effectiveness against emerging threats."

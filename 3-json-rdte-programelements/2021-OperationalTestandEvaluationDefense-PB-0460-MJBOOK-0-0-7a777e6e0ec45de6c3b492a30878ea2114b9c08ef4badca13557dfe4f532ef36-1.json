            "val": "This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME).  \n\nThis Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of LFT&E.  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives. JLF was initiated in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets. Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command, and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to increase the affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of Tri-Service aircraft through joint coordination and development of survivability technologies, design tools and assessment methodologies.  The JASP coordinates and conducts RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability, and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) and is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E.\n\nThe Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME) was chartered 50 years ago to serve as Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) focal point for munitions effectiveness information. The JTCG\/ME produces Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) that are the sole source for all Joint Service Authenticated non-nuclear weapons effectiveness data and methodology for DoD. The JMEMs are the \u201chow to\u201d manuals for putting ordnance on target and as such, directly impacts combat readiness, effectiveness, and survivability. JMEMs are used by the Warfighters in operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training; by the DoD, Joint, and Service planners in force-on-force modeling, mission area analysis, requirements studies and weapon procurement planning; and by the service acquisition community in performance assessment, analysis of alternatives and survivability enhancement studies. The JTCG\/ME continually evolves weapons effectiveness and target vulnerability data, standards, methodologies, and processes based on the strategic environment for better munitions effectiveness evaluation and support to a more lethal force. JTCG\/ME also increases efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department\u2019s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering and targeting capability to Coalition partners. The JMEM requirements and development processes are driven by operational lessons learned (Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support and Freedom Sentinel), Joint Staff Data Call and the needs of Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Military Targeting Committee (MTC) guided by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5140.01, Munitions Requirements Process (MRP) - DoD Instruction (DoDI) 3000.04 and Operational Users Working Groups (OUWGs) input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. Considerable effort goes into these user forums to establish Warfighter requirements for current and future JTCG\/ME products, as well as continued training events and day-to-day support -- all with the goal of enabling greater force lethality, strengthening partner capabilities, and optimal use of resources.  \n\nThis program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E, JASP, and JTCG\/ME programs."

                                                "val": "JLF Programs and LFT&E Initiatives\nThe FY 2019 JLF budget will support at least 28 projects (tentatively 9 new starts and 19 projects continuing from previous FYs).  JLF projects have been focused to either (1) build a more lethal force, (2) strengthen alliances and attract new partners, or (3) reform the department for greater performance and affordability.\n\nBuild a More Lethal Force\nIn FY 2019, JLF will continue to investigate means to advance the survivability therefore lethality of our systems in expected theater of operations. As an example, JLF will assess the vulnerability of aircraft to fuel tank fires due to ullage ignition in order to explore methods to reduce aircraft losses while maintaining mission effectiveness.  JLF will investigate the penetration of long yawed rods in order to support munition development such as the AIM-9X, ensuring the desired lethal effects are achieved when these weapons are employed.  JLF will also improve test instrumentation to allow more accurate assessment of imposed forces and crew casualties during mine or improvised explosive device attacks.  JLF will be performing assessments of flammable materiel commonly found in current Naval vessels during operations to better model and prevent fire initiation, as well as promote better design to contain the spread of fire and improve fire suppression techniques.\n\nStrengthen Alliances and Attract New Partners\nJLF is leveraging existing M&S tools and expanding their capabilities to expand evaluation of active protection systems that may be installed on a variety of U.S. platforms to defend against a variety of threats.  This work will be performed particularly in conjunction with efforts of partner nations such as Israel.  Furthermore, JLF will conduct a variety of underwater explosion tests and analyses of effects upon ship hulls.  These tests will be using hardware from a decommissioned Canadian ship and test execution conducted in cooperation with both Canadian and European Union partners.\n\nReform the Department for Greater Performance and Affordability\nIn FY 2019, the JLF program is sponsoring work by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Air Force Institution of Technology to assess the merits of test program methodologies utilized across industry, academia, and government, with the goal of leveraging the merits of these communities toward evaluating lethality\/survivability.  JLF will produce frameworks to allow the DoD to better tailor Live Fire test rigor for a variety of program timelines, including a sensitivity analysis to determine what general qualities are most important to test before rapidly fielding hardware or software.  In addition, JLF will better quantify the point of diminishing returns for major program of record Live Fire test programs in order to maximize return on investment.  Finally, JLF efforts will allow the DoD to better model the combined effects of multiple complex systems in a multi-model threat environment (for example, combined air and ground threats combined with electronic attack and cyber attack), enhancing performance in battle as well as focusing DoD investment in new hardware technologies.\n\nJASP\nIn FY 2019 the JASP will continue work on at least 23 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiate 11 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness. Improve aircraft survivability to fire by increasing the speed and efficiency of fire detection and suppression systems and the accuracy and confidence in prediction of threat initiated fires onboard aircraft. The Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness\nIn FY 2019, JTCG\/ME will continue to develop, enhance, and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness. This includes target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and CCMDs\u2019 needs.\n\nJTCG\/ME will deploy and continue to enhance future versions of its major JTCG\/ME Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) products, the JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS), Joint Antiair Combat Effectiveness (J-ACE), Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool, and the Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE). JTCG\/ME will continue to progress and develop non-kinetic JMEM capability with Joint-Non-Kinetic Effects (J-NKE) Tool, as well as support specialized solutions to address operational needs to include direct  analytical support to operations, Probability of kill (Pk) Lookup Tools, Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) analysis and tables, and munitions weaponeering guides.

Project\u2019s objectives will directly support NDS objectives to include building a more lethal force, new partnerships, or DoD business reforms. \n\nBuild a More Lethal Force\nIn FY 2020, JLF will continue to increase the accuracy and capability of critical modeling and simulation tools to support test and evaluation efficiency and ensure credibility of DOD assessments and weaponeering tools.\n- For example, one effort will increase the capability of existing naval M&S survivability and lethality evaluation tools. More specifically the project will develop more accurate damage effects as the threat penetrates multiple ship compartments, as typically seen in a realistic engagement.\n- Another effort will increase the capability of existing M&S tools used to evaluate fire propagation across ship compartments and the ensuing threat to the ship\/occupants, as well as recoverability capabilities pertaining to the damage caused by spreading fires.\n\nJLF efforts will also continue to resolve survivability and lethality related system design challenges of currently fielded U.S. systems.\n- For example, one JLF effort will address an evaluation shortfall related to body armor performance.  Existing LFT&E methods do not adequately correlate body armor data to actual injury.  This task will support the development of appropriate measures, techniques, and analyses to enable a more credible correlation of body armor data with injury.\n- JLF will enable the development of more rigorous test infrastructure needed to evaluate the effectiveness of fuel self-sealing bladders with aircraft.  Self-sealing bladders could significantly mitigate the vulnerability to the aircrew.  This test infrastructure will ensure self-sealing bladder's performance is more accurately characterized prior to final design reviews.\t\t\n\nReform the Department for Greater Performance and Affordability\nIn coordination with the Army and the Air Force, JLF will increase aircraft and ground combat vehicle survivability\/lethality M&S.\n- One effort will apply innovative techniques to increase the efficiency of existing M&S tools largely used to estimate lethality of piercing threats against our systems.  Improved lethality models will increase the credibility of our lethality evaluations and the credibility of weaponeering tools.\n\nJLF will also continue to lead innovation in LFT&E methods to increase LFT&E efficiency and support rapid fielding.\n- A new effort will develop an advanced teaming analysis capability to enable future survivability and lethality evaluations of a system-of-systems.  Current LFT&E has limited capability to assess the effectiveness of the system in the context of other supporting systems.  LFT&E is currently constrained to single system analyses, which is not always operationally representative.\n- Another new JLF effort will provide an M&S capability that will enable efficient evaluation of active protection systems integrated with ground combat vehicles.\n- JLF will develop machine learning algorithms to more effectively characterize armor performance.  Such algorithms will enable efficient LFT&E of future armor compositions and will inform future armor designs.\n\nJASP\nIn FY 2020 the JASP will continue work on 27 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiate 13 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E. The JASP will support the NDS objective to \u2018Build a More Lethal Force\u2019 by developing measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by advancing system hardening against rocket-propelled grenade, small-arms, and high-energy laser threats and increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness. Reform the DoD for Greater Performance and Affordability by funding the development of more efficient M&S tools and threat models to enable more effective aircraft survivability capability development, test and evaluation. \n\nThe Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue, and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness\nIn FY 2020, JTCG\/ME efforts will continue to assist the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in supporting the National Defense Strategy lines of effort of enabling greater force lethality, strengthening partner capabilities, and optimal use of resources through efficiency. \n\nJTCG\/ME will: \n-Develop, enhance, and standardize data\/methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness.

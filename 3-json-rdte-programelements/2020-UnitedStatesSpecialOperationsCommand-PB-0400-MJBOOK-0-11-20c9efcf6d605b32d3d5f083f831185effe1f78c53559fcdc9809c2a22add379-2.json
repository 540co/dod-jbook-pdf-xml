The Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) is part of a family of systems providing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), and analytical capabilities at the Component\/TSOC level and below through a combination of reach back, forward support, and collaboration.  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighters, analysts, and sensors to find and fix High Value Targets and provides a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services with SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and multi-national partners.  It connects the SOF warfighters and support analysts with essential intelligence information and provides situational awareness information to SOF leadership at all echelons. The three components of DCGS-SOF include the following: The Enterprise All Source Information Fusion (ENT\/ASIF) provides infrastructure, processing and intelligence analytical tools capabilities to allow for worldwide SOF intelligence information sharing via a globally connected cloud based architecture as well as a forward disconnected capability. SOF Geospatial Intelligence Processing Exploitation, and Dissemination (SGIP) provides capabilities in garrison and deployed environments of manned and unmanned sensors. SOF Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED) provides SIGINT exploitation capability in both garrison and deployed environments. Middle-Tier Acquisition (2016 NDAA Section 804) to accommodate rapid prototyping, may be utilized."

These alliances enable more agile access to (searchable, discoverable) and sharing of larger data domains and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements. The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, Interagency, and Coalition tactical Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by engineering development teams for SOF and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) FADE.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change."

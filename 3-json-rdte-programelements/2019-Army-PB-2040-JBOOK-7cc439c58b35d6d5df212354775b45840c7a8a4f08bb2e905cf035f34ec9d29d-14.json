Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. OTC conducts independent operational tests that provide significant data to Army decision-makers on key Army systems and concepts. This PE finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment."

Mission support for JTE includes supporting two Joint Tests under the Joint Test program, and assigned special projects.  ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, Suffolk VA, United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) J81 (Hawaii), and Marine Corps Warfighter Laboratory (Quantico, VA) with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support.

This Project finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.  \n\nOTC consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air Defense Artillery Test Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives. The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), Limited User Test (LUT), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE). OTC conducts operational tests required by public law (Title 10 USC 2399) that provide significant data to the Army decision makers on key Army systems and concepts."

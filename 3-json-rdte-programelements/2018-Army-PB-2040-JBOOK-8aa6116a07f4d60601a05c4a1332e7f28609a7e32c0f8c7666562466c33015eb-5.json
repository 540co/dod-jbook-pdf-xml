An AoA supporting the MS A decision has been completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with the OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015. Two DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) agreements were awarded to support efforts under the Material Solution Analysis (MSA) Phase. TMRR will include two DOTC award agreements for competitive prototyping leading to flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY19. Data from the TMRR phase to include results from the flight demonstrations will support the FY21 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award. EMD will be a competitive award to a single contractor. The EMD phase will complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and limited user test."

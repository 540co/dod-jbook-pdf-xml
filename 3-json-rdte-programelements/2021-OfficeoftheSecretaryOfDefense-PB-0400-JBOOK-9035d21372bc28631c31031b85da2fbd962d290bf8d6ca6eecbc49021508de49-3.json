            "val": "This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems. The goal is to develop joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs. The program invests in research of technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technologies with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts. Increasing the lethality, range and performance of munitions, while striving to increase the safety for our warfighters for munitions in procurement and under development guide program investments. This munitions based science and technology (S&T) program focuses on enhancements in weapon speed, range, and lethality while largely utilizing existing advanced insensitive munitions (IM) technology to maximize weapon safety. U.S. power projection capabilities related to near peer competition are lagging and there is an urgent need to provide US warfighters with increased or new capabilities. The program is striving to develop the most lethal weapons possible and communicating associated risks intelligently, so U.S. warfighters can make informed decisions about their weapon systems capabilities and safe handling requirements. IM compliance requirements remain an important aspect of munitions reliability and readiness and thus will remain a critical characteristic of the program. The 2018 National Defense Strategy denotes that \u201cChallenges to the U.S. military advantage represent another shift in the global security environment. For decades the United States has enjoyed uncontested or dominant superiority in every operating domain. Today, every domain is contested\u2014air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.\u201d Therefore, the program will invest in technologies that will enable U.S. warfighters to regain the operational and battlefield advantages that technologies can provide through increased performance, range, and lethality to improve the Joint Force military advantages and build a more lethal force. This program's investment portfolio has been aligned to complement, and utilize, the Department's priority technology areas.\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) are established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2025, 2030, and 2035 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their weapons system strategic plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plans, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate. The Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) utilize a Technical Advisory Board (TAB) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) technology experts and laboratory representatives, plus senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting."

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs."

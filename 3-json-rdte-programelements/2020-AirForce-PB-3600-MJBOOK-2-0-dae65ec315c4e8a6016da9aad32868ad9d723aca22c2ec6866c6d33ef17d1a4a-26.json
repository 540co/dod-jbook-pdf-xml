Operational since 1980, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions, such as, offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day\/night and all-weather) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)\/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD\/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies to meet emerging warfighter requirements and combat current and evolving enemy threats.  \n\nModification programs include: Operational Flight Program (OFP) development required to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to meet DoD mandates and keep the F-16, the respective training simulators, and other hardware subsystems current; Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which is a two-phased RDT&E effort, includes a Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to increase Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective); EMD Hardware\/Advanced capability improvements require funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence; Modular Mission Computer (MMC)Upgrade\/Display Generator Upgrade resolves shortfalls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability addresses cyber-security and includes Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground\/flight test for fielding; F-16 Training Simulator updates enable the USAF to exercise\/train using the most current F-16 OFP available to all block configurations, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers; Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) on F-16 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and flight test; Comm Suite Radio Upgrade (CSU) improved satellite communication (SATCOM) radio upgrade with Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capability to meet next-gen tactical narrowband SATCOM with better crypto capabilities; an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar capable on all blocks that offers advanced electronic protection capabilities as well as improved reliability and maintainability on F-16 aircraft; MIDS JTRS provides a real-time, jam resistant and secure information system for the transfer of combat data, voice and navigation information between widely dispersed battle elements; Hybrid Flight Control Computer (HFLCC) Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS)  development and integration prevents most controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents using terrain database and prediction algorithms for aircraft trajectory recovery and executes an automated fly up maneuver to avoid collision; Advanced Identification Friend or FOE (AIFF-Mode5)on F-16 aircraft provides improved airspeed and location info to ground stations and other equipped aircraft in vicinity; Digital Radar Warning Receiver improves on existing radar warning receiver performance and improves Electronic Warfare (EW) threat detection range, azimuth, detection time, and allows reduction of radio frequency compatibility issues with other on board transmitters.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-16 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

OFP SW development effort is now completely developed at Hill AFB (309 SMXG). Numerous Integration contracts (CPFF, FFP) are required to allow for Improved Avionics, Weapon, ADS-B, MIDS JTRS integration to successfully field with each OFP.\nMMC Upgrade awarded to Raytheon on 22 Nov 2016. PDG Upgrade awarded to General Dynamics Mission Systems on 17 Apr 2017.\nThe EMD HW\/Advanced capability improvements will develop, test, and qualify aircraft weapons systems, including subsystems and uses various contract types (Cost Plus and Fixed Price).\n\nThe Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) contract for development and production of the APG-83 radar awarded to Northrop Grumman 31 May 2017. The US Government is the prime integrator and a separate contract is in work for Lockheed Martin to provide integration support.\n\nAIFF Mode 5 Out program uses numerous contracts for DMS resolution, integration, production, support and installs. Funding will be awarded on the following contacts: harness IDIQ, Bracket IDIQ, Falcon 2020, Mode 5 IDIQ, and SASSM\/EGI IDIQ.\n\nAutomatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS) development will accomplish test and evaluation of the AGCAS system on F-16 Block 25\/30\/32 aircraft. Contracts are expected to be awarded by the end of 2018 with LM, flight test, and engineering contractors.\n\nDRWR is organically being integrated on the F-16 by F-16 System Program Office (AFLCMC\/WWM) and the Electronic Warfare Avionics (EWA) group at AFLCMC\/ WNY, Warner Robins AFB, GA. The ALR-69A production contract (managed by AFLCMC\/WNY) was awarded on 30 March 2018 to Raytheon, Goleta, CA (CAGE CD 06129). The ALR-69A software is organically managed by AFLCMC\/WNY utilizing the 579 SMXS (Software Maintenance) team and the OEM Raytheon, Goleta, CA. The ALR-69A hardware is sustained by the 408 SCMS (Supply Chain) and 402MXW (Hardware Maintenance) group at Warner Robins AFB, GA.\n\nFlight Test requires both organic test range support and various contract support for integration test of F-16 subsystems to ensure capabilities meet CAF fielding schedule, which includes Radio Frequency (RF) compatibility."

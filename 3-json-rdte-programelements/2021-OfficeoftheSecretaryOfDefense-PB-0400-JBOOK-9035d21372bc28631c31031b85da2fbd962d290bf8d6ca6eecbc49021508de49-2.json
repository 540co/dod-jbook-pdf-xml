Conduct annual review of the Centers.  Expand the HBCU\/MI Program to develop three new Centers of Excellence using the FY 2020 congressional increase. The first Center is an Aerospace Research and Education Innovation Center as directed by Congress ($2M congressional add). Additional program increase funding will be used to establish two new Centers to address R&E priority areas to include Materials Science and Biotechnology.  Conduct increased outreach activities, to include, one webinar and two technical assistance workshops to expose HBCUs\/MIs to opportunities in DoD. Also continue MSI town hall series in partnership with the National Academies of Science to examine strategies to expand HBCU\/MI STEM workforce preparedness and research & education activities. Collaborated with the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) for Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security at the University of Maryland \u2013 College Park to broaden HBCU\/MI partnership portfolios. Projected to commit $1.000 million towards the HBCU\/MI and UARC partnership, supporting two HBCU\/MI."

JCC2 establishes congressionally directed focal point to provide integrated JCC2 solutions to all echelons for execution of cyberspace operations to enable and accelerate planning\/collaboration between Cyber Mission Forces and Combatant Commands (CCMD).\n\nIt will integrate Cyber C2 with Joint, Coalition and inter-agency C2 to enhance multi-domain operations, reduce planning time, improve decision quality and speed resulting in a shorter kill chain. Capabilities will be developed to address the Cyber Mission Forces used to conduct cyber operations.  Additionally, it will establish the Continuous Infrastructure\/Continuous Development (CI\/CD) Framework (a cyber factory) to pace development with warfighter need. JCC2 development activities include, but are not limited to: rapid prototyping, development of software\/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations; risk reduction for emerging technologies; and development and assessment of operational systems for inclusion into JCC2 to meet capability requirements.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JCC2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Capabilities will be developed to address the Cyber Mission Forces used to conduct cyber operations.  Additionally, it will establish the Continuous Infrastructure\/Continuous Development (CI\/CD) Framework (a cyber factory) to pace development with warfighter need. JCC2 development activities include, but are not limited to: rapid prototyping, development of software\/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations; risk reduction for emerging technologies; and development and assessment of operational systems for inclusion into JCC2 to meet capability requirements.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JCC2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F."

The JCC2 program office will utilize new and existing contract vehicles and concept, development, risk management, production, or deployment plans as part of a streamlined approach. The JCC2 program office will establish continuous integration\/continuous development pipeline to facilitate the rapid development, integration, and fielding of capabilities to remain responsive to evolving warfighter requirements. The JCC2 program will execute the agile development requirements provided by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and USCYBERCOM stakeholder in accordance with the prioritization provided by the multi-Service JCC2 governance structure. The initial JCC2 capability will deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for immediate deployment and operational use. Subsequent build iterations will continue to deliver enhanced capabilities incrementally building the JCC2 capability to match warfighter needs. The JCC2 baseline capability relies on extensive development and evaluation efforts to analyze integration constraints and opportunities of Service-specific cyber capabilities."

Project 221 matures, integrates and demonstrates protection and survivability technologies such as active protection systems (APS), advanced vehicle armors, blast mitigation and occupant safety devices to address both current and emerging advanced threats to ground vehicles. Project 441 matures and demonstrates advanced ground vehicle power and mobility technologies such as powertrains, power generation and storage, water and fuel logistics, and running gear subsystems for military ground vehicles to enable a more efficient, mobile and deployable force. Project 497 matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware (computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command\/control\/driving mechanisms) and software that result in increased crew efficiencies, vehicle performance, reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) burdens and vehicle maintenance costs. Project 515 matures and demonstrates unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) technologies with a focus on sensors, perception hardware and software, and robotic control algorithms that enable UGV systems to maneuver on- and off-road at speeds which meet mission requirements with minimal human intervention.  \n \nWork in this PE is coordinated with, PE 0602105A (Materials), 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability, Robotics Technology), 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), 0602784 (Military Engineering Technology), 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), 0603005 (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology), 0603734 (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), 0604115A (Technology Maturation Initiatives), and 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n \nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM)"

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio..   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

EBC systems provide an operational capability for small combat units (battalion and below) and Soldiers in varying environments, which are rapidly deployable and re-locatable, require no Military Construction, and need limited materiel handing support. This Project matures technologies that can be combined to create mission specific lab demonstrators and develops metrics and methodologies to measure performance characteristics.  \n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier\/Squad Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602784A and 0603734A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is led, performed, and\/or managed by the Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA."

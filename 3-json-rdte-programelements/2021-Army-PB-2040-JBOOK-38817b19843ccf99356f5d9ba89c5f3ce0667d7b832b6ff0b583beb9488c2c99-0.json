Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense capabilities. As the Army proponent for GMD, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conducting warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identifying capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and developing Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to realize the GMD capabilities. As the Army integrator for global missile defense, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible for reviewing programs managed by the Army, other Services, Defense agencies and National agencies to ensure that they are correctly synchronized and will ultimately provide the capabilities required by USSTRATCOM to execute its global missile defense responsibilities."

Prototypes will be used to fully evaluate distributed cooling and legacy approaches; 3) Technology Complex Compound Materials for Thermal\/Energy Management prototypes will be manufactured and tested for suitability in high velocity impacts.  The planned compound is Coordinative Molecular Bond Armor Material and has potential to provide ballistics and thermal protection; 4) Upgrades are planned for the Advanced Measurement Optical Range facility to support laser radar development and testing; 5) HardWare-In-the-Loop (HWIL) for both open-loop device characterization and closed-loop dynamic hardware-in-the-loop simulation to characterize guidance and track-loop performance.  Simulate trajectories, and engagement would be utilized to drive the HWIL simulations (e.g. 3DOF, 6DOF); 6) Integration of a Fire Control (FC) for the near-term Long-Range Weapon System requirements for initial operational capability. Long range hypersonic weapon analysis, integration and fielding support."

JEMS provided all the blue position and location information for over 92,000 entities and routed to the Command Post of the Future (CPoF) and to the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) (next generation CPoF).   JEMS was used to fill intelligence reporting gaps providing situational awareness to military role players and monitored health status of select Red force targets as they were neutralized and indicated that those targets were destroyed (to mission command).  \n\nProvided Joint Embedded Messaging System (JEMS) Support to US Army Central Command (USARCENT), Directorate of Command and Control.  JEMS was used during the Iron Union 11 Exercise to integrate a variety of C4I systems displaying Red and Blue forces with the Emirates Land Tactical System (ELTS).  Message formats were successfully sent to OTH-Gold enhanced Contact Report from JEMS to ELTS \/ both ways.

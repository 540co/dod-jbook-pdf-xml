These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

This funds R&D at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&D.\n\nThis project provides funding for the pilot administrative program authorized by the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (SEC. 5141.

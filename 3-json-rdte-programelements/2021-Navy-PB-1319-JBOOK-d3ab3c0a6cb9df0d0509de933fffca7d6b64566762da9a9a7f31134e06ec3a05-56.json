            "val": "Section 872 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2018 (P.L. 115-91) directed the Secretary of Defense to task the Defense Innovation Board (DIB) to undertake a study on \"streamlining [the Department's] software development and acquisition regulations.\" The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) submitted the final report to Congress in May 2019. The DIB's report made recommendations aimed at transforming the way the Department acquires, develops, and deploys software and manages digital talent. The DIB encouraged the creation of a \"new appropriation category for software capability delivery that allows (relevant types of) software to be funded as a single budget item, with no separation between RDT&E, production and sustainment.\" The recommendation stemmed from the DIB's observation that current law, regulations, and policies (including those governing program funding and appropriations) treat software acquisition and development as a series of discrete, sequential steps; and that this approach is at odds with modern software, which is continuously updated to provide new functionality.  This program has been designated as a Software and Digital Technology Pilot Program by the Secretary of Defense or the explanatory statement regarding this Act.  The funding in this line is requested to be used for expenses necessary for agile procurement, production, modification and operation and maintenance of the pilot program requirements.\n\n\nThe Risk Management Information (RMI) software pilot program is a consolidation of DON risk management requirements into a single Program of Record (POR) to provide modern safety reporting and management capabilities for both active and reserve Navy and Marine Corps commands. RMI enables agile responses to business rule changes, automation of routine actions, improved data integrity, and facilitates self-service for organizations and individuals. RMI is being developed in three increments of capabilities: Streamlined Incident Reporting (SIR), Safety Program Management (SPM), and Analysis & Dissemination (A&D). A fourth requirement, Portal integration, will be accomplished as part of the development of the three RMI increments since each will be built on the same Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) platform. Each of these capabilities will be acquired as individual Abbreviated Acquisition Programs using an incremental development approach for reengineered business processes, while consolidating five legacy systems Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS), Enterprise Safety Application Management Systems (ESAMS), Portsmouth Occupational Accident and Illness Reporting System (POAIRS), Medical Mishap and Compensation (MMAC), and Injury Tracker (INJTRK)."

The focus of SPM is to develop a system that increases the SPM capability for a material solution in full compliance with DoD and occupational health standards and policies, safety incident reporting, and incident data capture.\n\nThe SPM program establishes subject matter expertise teams to create SPM modules that satisfy the requirements as set\nforth in the Functional Requirements Document (FRD). Critical to the FY21 success is the subject matter experts (Navy and Marine Corps from all chain of command levels, ashore and afloat) defining the use cases for each of the SPM modules\nthat identifies the sequence of events, interdependencies and relationships across the modules. The subject matter experts further establish detailed requirements to support the development of SPM modules, (approximate total 11) resulting in design specifications, updated business processes, training curriculum and testing criteria for developers to create the frontend SPM application. \n\nIn FY21, RMI also creates an SPM architecture and Single Point of Entry (SPOE), and integrates the SPM modules into\nan Enterprise Data Warehouse (Analysis and Dissemination) that facilitates increased business efficiency by implementing\nlogical business flow and connected beginning-to-end reporting structures and tool sets. The data warehouse will provide\na \"data lake\" construct enhancing the Navy's predictive analytics capability resulting in the identification of contributing factors to safety events. These factors serve as leading indicators for users to identify and mitigate safety-related risk factors. \n\nThree incremental deployments to projected completion of Enterprise Data Warehouse (Analysis and Dissemination) in FY21. Final Increment 3 deployment foundation is partnership between NAVSAFECEN and Army Analytics Group (AAG) - parallel and complementary efforts.\n\nSIR Release 1 deployment date re-baselined to 31 August 2020 with Release 2 scheduled for Q1FY21."

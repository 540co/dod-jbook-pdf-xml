            "val": "This project develops and conducts both kinetic and non-kinetic technology demonstrations to advance warfighter capabilities. The technologies address enabling and enduring Air Force requirements as well as integrated enterprise transformational capabilities intended to reshape the future force. This project includes conventional weapons and component technologies; directed energy weapon technologies; electronic combat technologies; cyber-attack, cyber defense, and cyber support technologies; and development of corresponding susceptibility, vulnerability, and lethality databases. The transformational integrated technology demonstrations will utilize cross-discipline modeling and simulation to demonstrate capabilities in a near-operational environment.  Using modeling and simulation, this project seeks to determine advanced science and technology capabilities which reduce operational risk and accelerate transition into existing and future operational systems. \n\nEfforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E),Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the Secretary of the Air Force in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603605F, Advanced Weapons Technology, and associated Projects 633151, High Power Solid State Laser Technology and 633152, High Power Microwave Technology, are transferred to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, is transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63431G, RF Warning & Countermeasures Tech, is transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, with the exception of the work and funding that is associated with the Navigation Technology Satellite-3 Vanguard demonstration.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities, and Project 63691X, EO\/IR Warning & Countermeasures Tech, are transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63670A, Weapon Technology Development, is transferred from PE 0603601F, Conventional Weapons Technology, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63670B, Weapon Concept Development, is transferred from PE 0603601F, Conventional Weapons Technology, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, with the exception of the work and funding that is associated with the Golden Horde Vanguard demonstration.\n\nThese transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment, and not a new start.\n\nThe Air Force Science and Technology portfolio will continued to be managed at the Enterprise level by the Air Force Technology Executive Officer, dual-hatted as the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Commander, and executed across the various AFRL Technology Directorates and locations.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It establishes and maintains an all-source, physics-based, threat-to-countermeasures electronic warfare systems engineering methodology.  It develops a core analytic function, supported by simulation-based wargaming and interactive engineering modeling capabilities to evaluate advanced countermeasures concepts.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities, from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, is transferred to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE Consolidation in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Operating Concept and AF Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

This project develops the ability to deliver cyber-attack capabilities (access, stealth, persistence, intelligence, and weapons delivery), cyber defense capabilities (attack detection, attack attribution, and response automation) and cyber support capabilities (situation awareness and war gaming). This project will also develop 1) a science and engineering capability demonstrating new models of computation, 2) novel approaches for high performance, interactive, net-centric, distributed and embedded computing systems, and 3) the technological tools enabling affordable, large-scale, and complex software-intensive systems.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on cyber technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, is transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Information Technology Directorate located in Rome, New York. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

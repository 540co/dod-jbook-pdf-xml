            "val": "This program element develops upgrades to existing financial management systems. These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.\n\nThere are two projects within this program element: Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1), and DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD), formerly known as DEAMS Increment 2. Project 675178: DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD) started in FY2019 under PE 0901538F. Project 675179: DEAMS Increment 1 was under PE 0901538F through FY2019.\n\nThe Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. The DEAMS implementation will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). DEAMS is a key enabler and provides the core accounting system for all enterprise business system development necessary to sustain financial statement auditability.\n\nDEAMS enhancements will be governed in Capability Support Phase after Increment 1 Full Deployment (FD).\n\nDEAMS is the Air Force's target core accounting and financial management solution and is a key component of the long-term business process improvements needed to sustain auditability and correct financial system weaknesses.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver accounting and financial management capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $11.378 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.\n\nThe remaining DEAMS Increment 1 development activities will be completed using agile software development methodologies under a project called DEAMS Rapid Acquisition.  In FY2019, DEAMS CCD was added to the FY2018 NDAA, as a Section 873 Agile Pilot program; Rapid Acquisition will also be a stepping stone in the implementation of agile development methodologies for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD).  Under Rapid Acquisition, the program contracted with a new System Integrator (SI) to sustain the DEAMS R12 baseline, develop the remaining Inc. 1 requirements (disbursing, reporting, Governance\/Risk\/Compliance (GRC)), and provide continual enhancement and improvement to the deployed system, utilizing agile software development.\n\nDEAMS CCD capabilities will be implemented utilizing an agile software development methodology. Requirements for CCD include, but are not limited to, development of the core accounting and reporting functionality necessary to enable deployment of modernized personnel, contracting, and logistics systems. Additional capabilities under requirements definition include complex acquisition management, reimbursable cost accounting, military entitlement accounting, advanced accounting controls and audit sustainment, treasury cash accountability, and management accounting and billing for revolving funds. Included in these capabilities are selected requirements deferred from Increment 1. \n\nRequirements will be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced after every sprint. The PMO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.\n\nAdditional user deployments enabled by future increment capabilities include acquisition program executive offices; ranges, laboratories and test centers; and air logistics centers. These deployments will add an additional 4,600 users to Inc 1 baseline for a total of 22,500 users.\n\nThis funding request will support development of the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) compliant information artifacts and plans necessary to support the program, Capability Process Maps (CPMs) for each business capability, and mapping of financial management processes the capability will require (Blueprinting). Additionally, the funding will support acquisition strategy planning by early identification\/definition of Information Technology Functional Requirements (ITFRs) and Information Assets (IA), Acquisition Strategy Determination, Solution Approach, and Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation.\n\nFunds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities. Additional activities also include studies and analysis to support both program planning and execution.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver accounting and financial management capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.\n\nDEAMS user deployments include:\n- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)\n- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome\n- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)\n- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan\n- U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio\n- Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) (Incremental Deployments)\n- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs\n\nOn 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increments. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Inc 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Force in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (FD ATP) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. (FD ATP date is August 2020 and Capability Support Authority to Proceed (CS ATP) date is February 2021.)\n\nThe remaining DEAMS Inc 1 schedule includes the Oracle e-Business Suite R12 upgrade and development and deployment of the remaining Increment 1 capabilities (disbursing, reporting, and Governance\/Risk\/Compliance (GRC)), as well as enhancements and improvements to the existing baseline.  In accordance with the FY2019 NDAA, DEAMS is an Agile Pilot program as defined in Sec 873 of the FY2018 NDAA, and all remaining development will be accomplished using agile software development methodologies.\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 is developing capability which allows for deployment to the remaining user locations. However, DEAMS has also begun transitioning previously deployed locations to the Operation and Support (O&S) phase.\n\nFunds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver accounting and financial management capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

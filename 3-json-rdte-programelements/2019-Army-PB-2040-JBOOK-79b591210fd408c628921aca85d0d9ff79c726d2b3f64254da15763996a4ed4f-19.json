            "val": "The program element \"Distributive Interactive Simulations - Engineering Development\" applies to the Army's Advanced Simulation Program, which enables operational readiness and the development of concepts and systems for the Future Force through the application of new simulation technology and techniques.  The development and application of simulation technology will provide the means to link electronically a range of various simulation tools in a manner that is transparent to the user.  The amalgam of simulations and tools is linked together to enable execution of an event; to verify the scenarios, tactics\/techniques and procedures; to train testers on new hardware\/software; and to conduct trial test runs before costly live field tests.  The tools developed are available for reuse by developers and users of simulations throughout the Army.  \n\nProject C74 funds the HQDA-chartered mission of the Simulation-to-Mission Command Interoperability (SIMCI) Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) in support of Army Training and Readiness. The SIMCI OIPT mission is to provide policy recommendations to Army senior leadership to improve organizations by allowing Soldiers to fight in the same manner in which they train. This is accomplished by interoperability between Mission Command (MC) systems and the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) systems the Army uses to stimulate MC systems for training Soldiers and their Leaders. SIMCI also invests in targeted solutions to critical problem areas that exist between MC and Simulations. The SIMCI OIPT, led by Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (STRI) and PEO Command Control Communications-Tactical (C3T), uses focused collaborative processes among its 30+ Army organizations to identify key\/critical interoperability shortfalls and the required materiel solutions.\n\nProject C77, Army Geospatial Data Master Plan, focuses on activities that start with data acquisition from multiple sources and culminate in (1) accurate, robust and timely geospatial data and data management and (2) integration and conversion tools that support multiple battle command, training and mission-rehearsal applications. Project C77 continues development efforts associated with the Ground-Warfighter Geospatial Data Model (GGDM) and Geospatial Data Standards.\n\nOne Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) Project C78 develops and delivers a software application that represents activities of units and forces in simulation to support Army Training and Readiness. The application is used by Army agencies to support the concept evaluation, experimentation, materiel acquisition and training throughout the communities.  The focus of this project is systems\/software engineering and design for development and evolution of the architecture and software tools for a universal system of Army computer-generated forces -- OneSAF. OneSAF is a high fidelity brigade-and-below SAF that represents a full range of operations, systems and control processes in support of stand-alone and embedded training and Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) simulation applications. OneSAF is fully interoperable with the Army's emerging virtual, live, and division-and-above constructive simulations and provides next-generation simulation products. OneSAF replaces a variety of legacy simulations used within the Army to support analytic and training simulation activities."

SIMCI investments consist primarily of cost-sharing initiatives, leveraging initial system solutions of acquisition programs to enhance the interoperability of multiple systems in the Joint Operational Environment. SIMCI investments accelerate implementation within MC and M&S systems, of common data models and information exchanges that are used by other Services and coalition nations, thus enhancing the inherent ability of Army systems to interoperate seamlessly in a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) environment.  \n\nFY 2019 funding continues progress with embedding simulation into Mission Command Systems via the Ozone Widget Framework, continues management of the SIMCI OIPT's Army-wide collaborative, interoperability enhancement activities, including architecture alignment, data model alignment, common standards, components, and products. It is focused first on reducing costs and improving capabilities in the areas of automating Operational Plans, Orders, and Reports in support of Army, Joint, and Coalition operations.  Objectives are: identify and articulate to HQDA senior leadership specific standards that require Army-wide implementation; co-develop data standards, architecture standards, implementation specifications and Joint\/Coalition products; continue transition of SIMCI knowledge and proof-of-principle products to Army and Joint acquisition programs."

This will support the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army's request to find redundancy within the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) community and reduce it.  Objectives are to compare the current M&S capabilities with what will be required in the upcoming LVC-Information Assurance (LVC-IA) and Integrated Training Environment (ITE) environments, which will eventually become the Simulated Training Environment (STE) in 2025.  This will be Army-wide, as well as, Joint combined interagency products.  Focus on ITE with the creation of the blueprint for STE, which is slated to be implemented in 2025."

The AGDIMP and the GIO charter, Geospatial Annex to COE IP, and AR 115-11 require the establishment of an enterprise architecture framed around geospatial standards that address geospatial\/GEOINT data, services, and applications to enable the Army Geospatial Enterprise (AGE). This Army Geospatial Enterprise serves the Army's Programs\/Systems, Organizations (most importantly our soldiers) to provide the geospatial foundation of accurate, robust, and timely geospatial data, robust tools and services that support mission command, intelligence, training, mission-rehearsal and other mission-applications. Project C77 addresses a geospatial\/GeoINT standard-base framework that supports the ground-warfighter. This geospatial standard framework must also fit within the broader National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) and Allies Systems for GeoINT (ASG) architecture and standards.  The establishment of a ground-warfighter, standards-based framework support the management, dissemination, and update of geospatial data and services from National systems and organization to tactical systems and ground-warfighter in an enterprise fashion that will minimal translation into unique and often proprietary data formats and internal application databases.  \n\nFY 2019 funding continues development efforts associated with the Ground-Warfighter Geospatial Data Model (GGDM) and integration of Geospatial Data Standards into the U.S. Army Geospatial Enterprise (AGE) and the Army M&S Enterprise."

The application is used by Army agencies to support the concept evaluation, experimentation, materiel acquisition and training throughout the communities.  The focus of this project is systems\/software engineering and design for development and evolution of the architecture and software tools for a universal system of Army computer-generated forces -- OneSAF. OneSAF is a high fidelity brigade-and-below SAF that represents a full range of operations, systems and control processes in support of stand-alone and embedded training and Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) simulation applications. OneSAF is fully interoperable with the Army's emerging virtual, live, and division-and-above constructive simulations and provides next-generation simulation products. OneSAF replaces a variety of legacy simulations used within the Army to support analytic and training simulation activities.  \n\nFY 2019 funding allows for continued development of the software product line by addressing OneSAF Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3Is) as prioritized and approved by the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). This funding also provides for the management of the infrastructure, equipment, laboratories, and processes needed to develop, test, and release the required product baseline."

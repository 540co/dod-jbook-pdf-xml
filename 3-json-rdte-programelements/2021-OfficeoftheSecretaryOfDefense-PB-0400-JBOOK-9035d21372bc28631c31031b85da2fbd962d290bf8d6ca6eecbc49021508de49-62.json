It addresses the challenges of 1) having enduring access to a multiplicity of modern manufacturing processes that require commercial volumes to maintain long term viability and 2) protecting the intellectual property (IP) of the microelectronic parts that are manufactured.\n\nThis PE supports the 2018 National Defense Strategy\u2019s (NDS) line of effort to build a more lethal force through modernization of key capabilities, the NDS defense objective of establishing an unmatched twenty-first century National Security Innovation Base that effectively supports Department operations and sustains security and solvency, and the NDS strategic approach of reforming the Department\u2019s business practices by simultaneously increasing performance and affordability while still minimizing risk.\n\nThis PE supports the OUSD(R&E) Microelectronics Modernization Roadmap.  The primary areas of focus of this roadmap include the following:  access to advanced packaging and test; quantifiable assurance and secure design; foundry access; verification and validation; policies, standards, and Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) governing body; access to radiation hardened microelectronics; access to non-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) SOTA microelectronics; disruptive research and development; education and workforce development; trusted foundry and obsolescence; and supply chain awareness and security.\n\nRecognizing that an assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG. \n\nThis activity is being led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering."

DoD\u2019s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD\u2019s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) intellectual property (IP) from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the core trusted and assured microelectronics (T&AM) laboratories with regard to verification and validation in support of microelectronics assurance.\n\nThis program of research will demonstrate quantitative and innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD\u2019s microelectronics supply chain and IP.  Furthermore a quantitative assurance methodology using metrics from assurance mitigations will be demonstrated to enable access to SOTA microelectronics.  Assurance mitigations will be demonstrated for Field Programmable Gate Array devices in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will demonstrate advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing, lifecycle provenance and traceability, and independent verification and validation of commercial and specialized DoD designs and IP.  It also demonstrates and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.  In addition it demonstrates and implements new technologies to assess the security of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) assurance mechanisms.\n\nAssurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the ability of the U.S. Government (USG) to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in secure environments.  The project will also support demonstration of a repository of third-party IP and electronic design automation (EDA) and assurance tool marketplace to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use."

In particular, DoD needs access to a diverse microelectronics ecosystem to develop and acquire the application specific integrated circuit (ASICs) and personalized commercial off the shelf (COTS) components required for military radiation hardened and radio frequency and optical needs.  \n\nThe Department frequently relies on commercial suppliers to optimize performance and reduce costs for sophisticated weapon system and secure network functionality.

This is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed each of the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, Army received an OSD Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 29 October 2014. On 24 March 2016, the USD(AT&L) signed the program's RFP Release Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which designated ACWS as an unbaselined, Major Automated Information System Acquisition Category IAM program, and approved the Army's request to release an RFP to industry to procure a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system."

RR will include several key activities conducted in parallel.  First, the program will conduct Global Analysis and Business Blueprinting to optimize the To-Be, End-to-End, Procure-to-Pay processes and business scenarios. The program will define applicable Business Process Designs, identify any gaps between the COTS product and the ACWS requirements and determine how to resolve those gaps.  This will all be done with the goal to align Army processes, as much as possible, to the COTS product processes. This will save significant development dollars.  This phase will also include design of the required interfaces that are not included as part of the original COTS solution. The ultimate goal of this phase is to maintain the COTS baseline and reduce requirement for customization with a plan that allocates capabilities and interfaces across all software builds. The allocated baseline will be reviewed\/ approved during a Preliminary Design Review."

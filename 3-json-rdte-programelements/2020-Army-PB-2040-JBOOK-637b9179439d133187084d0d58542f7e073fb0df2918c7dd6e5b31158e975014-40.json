            "val": "The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's newest generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify\/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT). Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.  \n\nAirborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 in accordance with the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8). Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.\n\nThe RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is a fixed-wing, airborne Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) collection and precision targeting location system. GRCS provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify\/identify high value targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. The Army's Acquisition Objective\/Army's Procurement Objective is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd Ml; and seven (7) fielded to the 204th Ml, and five (5) trainers within TRADOC and INSCOM. Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project."

It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify\/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT).\n\nThis funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full Motion Video (FMV); Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar \/ Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI) Radar; Line-Of-Site (LOS) and Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. \n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2020 funding in the amount of $5.959 million continues the development of sensor enhancements and provides PED sensor engineering support.  The EMARSS sensor enhancements will replace the existing SIGINT and LiDAR capabilities with an improved sensor system which provides greater standoff range and significantly improved area coverage rate for the EMARSS platform.  This enhancement addresses the approved EMARSS Capability Production Document (CPD) performance requirements."

ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2020 OCO funding of $14.000 million continues the new signal enhancement development effort to develop software to enhance the COMINT collection capabilities and the lab and flight test for Signal 3 and 4 software to see if it meets the requirements in the ARL-E CPD. This funding line supports continued software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters."

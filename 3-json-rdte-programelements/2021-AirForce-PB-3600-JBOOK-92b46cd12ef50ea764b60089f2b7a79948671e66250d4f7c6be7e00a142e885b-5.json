            "val": "This program investigates, develops, and analyzes aerospace vehicle technologies in the six primary areas of high speed systems, power and flight control technologies, rocket propulsion, turbine engine technologies, fuel sciences, and  aeromechanics and structure systems. The effort has six projects, each focusing on a technology area critical to the Air Force. The High Speed Systems Technology project develops high speed\/hypersonic aerospace vehicles as well as high-speed air breathing propulsion engines to include combined cycle, ramjet, and hypersonic scramjet technologies to enable revolutionary propulsion capability for the Air Force. The Power and Flight Control Technologies project develops technologies that enable maximum affordable capability from manned, remotely-piloted and autonomous aerospace vehicles while developing electrical and thermal control technologies for military applications that remove operational limitations and enable advanced vehicle designs and high-power mission systems. The Rocket Propulsion Technology project develops advances in rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, missiles, the sustainment of strategic systems, and tactical rockets. The Turbine Engine Technology project develops and enables advanced engine architectures across small, medium, large thrust classes; to provide optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and integrated propulsion, power, and thermal capability, while enhancing affordability. Includes technology concepts for legacy and future, advanced turbine engines. The Aerospace Fuel Technology project evaluates hydrocarbon-based fuels for legacy and advanced turbine engines, scramjets, pulse detonation, and combined-cycle engines. The Aeromechanics and Structures project develops and exploits new  materials, fabrication processes, design techniques, and incorporating vehicle, inter-vehicle, and intra-vehicle control systems. Advanced aerodynamic vehicle configurations are developed and analyzed through simulations, experiments, and multi-disciplinary analyses. \n\nIn FY 2021, the Aerospace Systems RDT&E Budget Activity 02 (BA02) efforts and activities under PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, and PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, are realigned and consolidated into PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of internal Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate operations to finalize the 2012 merger of the Air Vehicles Directorate and Propulsion Directorate; and to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and the Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.\n\nAll transfers detailed below are administrative realignments for consolidation, and not new starts. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located either in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH or Edwards Air Force Base, CA.  \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 623066, Turbine Engine Technology, is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 623066, Turbine Engine Technology. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 623048, Combustion & Mechanical Systems is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 623066, Turbine Engine Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, Project 632480, Aerospace Fuels is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 624847 , Rocket Propulsion Technology, is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 624847, Rocket Propulsion Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 622403, Flight Controls & Pilot-Vehicle Interface is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 622406, Aerospace Power & Flight Control Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Program Element 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 622404, Aeromechanics & Integration, is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 622401, Aeromechanics & Structures Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 623012, Advanced Propulsion Technology is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 622405, High Speed Systems Technology. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Develop technologies to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion\nindustry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD). Technologies under this project enable capabilities of interest to both DoD and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Tasks include: modeling and simulation; proof of concept tests of critical components; advanced component development; and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance tasks could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50%, enabling motor replacement for cause. All thrusts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) collaboration and are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee yearly for relevance to DoD missions and progress towards RP21 Goals. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 624847 , Rocket Propulsion Technology, is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 624847, Rocket Propulsion Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

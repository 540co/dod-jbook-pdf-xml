Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios as well as the maturation and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Benefits include maturing technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, informing emerging requirements for future programs of record, and reducing technology risk in order to transition of leap-ahead capabilities into acquisition programs. Technology Maturation Initiative efforts mature and integrate advanced component technologies into system and sub-system technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes, which are then validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and programs of record. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms. This PE provides the Army with an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) efforts and acquisition programs.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this PE is performed by the Army Futures Command (AFC), the Engineer Research Development Center (ERDC), and U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT)."

These demonstrations will inform requirements, decrease risk for future Army HEL acquisition programs, and support the future development of warfighter Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures and Concept of Operations. HEL weapon systems are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to stockpile ordnance. A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); sensors; and optics for maneuvering Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs). Demonstrations will also inform potential future capability to defeat both fixed- and rotary-wing manned aircraft. Leveraging Government investments and Industry technology advancements, will review and select existing HEL subsystem designs for integration into a Stryker combat vehicle; will conduct integration and demonstration of a system-level HEL experimental prototype; and will provide assessment of technical performance in an operational environment.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT).\n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY 2020 financial restructure and to support Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy."

This Project integrates and assesses critical ALAS-MC 50mm technology components for on-the-move engagement of moving personnel and materiel targets, bringing the subsystem to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Under Advanced Targeting and Lethality Automated System (ATLAS), this Project matures and integrates advanced Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning (AI\/ML) algorithms to enable aided target detection\/recognition capability for NGCV using next generation, multi-spectral electro-optical and infrared (EO\/IR) targeting sensors. AI\/ML algorithms are integrated with real-time intelligent fire control and mission planning interfaces to demonstrate automated turret capabilities, and provide overmatch via reduced target acquisition and engagement timelines.\n\nWork in this Project is related to and fully integrated with the efforts funded in PE 0603462A, Project BF5, Advanced Lethality and Accuracy System for Med Cal; and PE 0603462A, Project BG1, Sensors for Autonomous Operations and Survivability Advanced Technology.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

It will demonstrate revolutionary performance to support Long Range Fires by further developing, integrating, and demonstrating enhanced lethality and range extension solutions for cannon system performance with maximum effects.  Strategic Long Range Cannon activities include integrating component technologies into sub-system and system-level experimental prototypes for novel cannon, munition, and fire control, including guidance and propulsion. Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) activities mature, integrate, and demonstrate a novel sub-system for ammunition handling and a long-range artillery projectile to support prototyping and experimentation of a next-generation, extended range armaments system that will provide significantly increased range and accuracy without an increase in platform weight. This Project also demonstrates and experiments with emerging and commercially-available technology components to demonstrate improved Stinger capabilities when used in a Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) configuration.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) efforts mature and integrate component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes are validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation and acquisition efforts to inform requirements for future programs of record and reduce the risk of technology insertion. These efforts are typically 2-4 years in duration, and are approved by Army senior leadership based on priority and opportunity, to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Activities include the maturation, integration, and demonstration of HEL prototype weapons performance on a combat platform in realistic operational environments in support of the Army's objective capability for Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD). A 50 kilowatt (kW)-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial systems(UASs), sensors, and optics for maneuvering brigade combat teams (BCTs). Activities also include sub-system prototyping and integration of leap-ahead ground combat vehicle powertrain technologies; and integration and demonstration of key Active Protection System (APS) components to provide modular and layered vehicle protection effects (hard-kill and soft-kill), enabling power projection and enhanced survivability. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms. This Project provides the Army with an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishing a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) efforts and acquisition programs.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  Work in this Project is performed by the Army Futures Command (AFC); the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT); and the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).\n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY 2020 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities."

A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM); UAVs; sensors; and optics for maneuvering BCTs. Demonstrations will also inform potential future capability to defeat both fixed- and rotary-wing manned aircraft. Leveraging Government investments and Industry technology advancements, will review and select existing HEL subsystem designs for integration into a Stryker vehicle; will conduct integration and demonstration of a system-level HEL experimental prototype; and will provide assessment of technical performance in an operational environment."

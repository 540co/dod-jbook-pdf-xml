            "val": "The Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) directed the formation of the Marine Corps Rapid Capabilities Office (MCRCO) to accelerate the identification, development and assessment of capabilities that appear to offer significant military utility. The MCRCO will seek emergent and disruptive technology to rapidly develop and deliver operational prototypes that increase Operating Forces' survivability and lethality, and that will inform requirement development and investment planning.  Prototypes to be assessed will be at a Technology Readiness Level 7 or higher and can be either non developmental government off the shelf, non-developmental commercial off the shelf, or developmental items.\n\nFY18 efforts include, but are not limited to, product development and operational forces assessment for Tactical Electro-Magnetic Signature Operations and Support (TEMSOS) and Organic Precision Fires (formerly Long Range Precision Fires). TEMSOS will provide enhanced uninterruptable intra-unit communications, alternate precision navigation, friendly force electromagnetic signature monitoring, enhanced situational awareness, and tactical advantage through electronic attack. Organic Precision Fires will provide long-range guided anti-armor precision fires with both on-board and meshed data links for enhanced targeting accuracy for this small unmanned aircraft munition.  These capabilities have been identified as key immediate operational force survivability and lethality enablers to counter current enemy capabilities. 26 March General Officer Board of Directors (GOBoD) decision moved the planned SWARM effort into the FY19 Autonomous Vehicle focus area.\n\nFY19 efforts include Autonomous Vehicles, Tactical Information Warfare, and Urban Engagement Systems.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles: This effort will identify, prototype, and assess the use in a variety of combat and supporting use employments, vehicles capable of sensing their environment, while navigating and functioning independently without human conduction to take evasive or defensive action and avoid detection, tracking, targeting or attack, provide an alternative reconnoiter capability in non-permissive settings for the purpose of mapping and patrolling for the purpose of intensifying combat power and reducing risk to the force.\n\nTactical Information Warfare:   This effort will identify, prototype, and assess various informations systems that provide small unit ability to undermine local opposing force information quality, while ensuring friendly forces a timely, accurate, superior capability to automatically correlate relevant active and passive information from organic and non-organic sensors that will increase their combat effectiveness in this emerging warfighting discipline.  \n\nUrban Engagement Systems:  This effort will identify, prototype and assess small unit systems to provide them enhanced situational awareness to locate and track opposing forces in tall buildings, narrow alleys, sewage tunnels and subway systems in order to minimize friendly force exposure, reduce potential collateral damage, and offer increased force protection measures by means of amplified  lethality, improved discrimination ability, and enhances survivability.\n\nFY20 efforts include Fight the Naval Force Forward, Human Performance Augmentation, and Organic Resource Generation. These efforts are linked to USMC specific warfighting strategies, the National Defense Strategy, the Marine Operating Concept, and the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab Campaign Plan.  These policy and strategy linkages insure these efforts will be focused on the proper priorities.  \n\nThe Fight the Naval Force Forward effort will identify, prototype, and assess systems that provide critical capabilities for small task organized units operating as the forward edge of an inside force.  Efforts includes active and passive systems that operate with resilience in a Network-Contested Environment (NCE) and smaller, dispersed, and resilient systems which operate from diverse platforms.\n\nThe Human Performance Augmentation effort will identify, prototype, and assess various wearables that enhance physical and or cognitive capabilities of the individual Marine that will increase their combat effectiveness. System efforts include exoskeletons, man-machine, and artificial intelligence interfaces to enhance performance including close combat lethality in complex terrain. \n\nThe Organic Resource Generation effort will identify, prototype and assess personal and small unit systems in optionally mounted configurations that enable creation of various classes of supply to extend operational endurance and reduce logistical reliance.  Organic Resource Generation efforts include decentralized energy generation, water recycling and desalination, energy storage, increase deployed energy efficiency, bio-fuels, and non-commercially dependent distributed logistics."

Prototypes to be assessed will be at a Technology Readiness Level 7 or higher and can be either non developmental government off the shelf, non-developmental commercial off the shelf, or developmental items.\n\nFY18 efforts included, but were not limited to, product development and operational forces assessment for Tactical Electro-Magnetic Signature Operations and Support (TEMSOS) and Organic Precision Fires (formerly Long Range Precision Fires). TEMSOS will provide enhanced uninterruptable intra-unit communications, alternate precision navigation, friendly force electromagnetic signature monitoring, enhanced situational awareness, and tactical advantage through electronic attack. Organic Precision Fires will provide long-range guided anti-armor precision fires with both on-board and meshed data links for enhanced targeting accuracy for this small unmanned aircraft munition.  These capabilities have been identified as key immediate operational force survivability and lethality enablers to counter current enemy capabilities. 26 March General Officer Board of Directors (GOBoD) decision moved the planned SWARM effort into the FY19 Autonomous Vehicle focus area.  Initial Autonomy & Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) efforts and Augmented Reality (AR) software development were also FY18 efforts.\n\nFY19 efforts include Autonomous Vehicles, Tactical Information Warfare, and Urban Engagement Systems.  Autonomous Vehicles will identify, prototype, and assess the use in a variety of combat and supporting use employments, vehicles capable of sensing their environment, while navigating and functioning independently without human conduction.  Tactical Information Warfare will identify, prototype, and assess systems that allow small units to undermine local opposing force information, while ensuring friendly force superior command and control.  Effort will correlate relevant active and passive sensors that increase combat effectiveness.  Urban Engagement Systems will prototype and assess small unit enhanced situational awareness systems to locate and track opposing forces in tall buildings, narrow alleys, sewage tunnels and subway systems.  Goal is to minimize friendly force exposure, reduce potential collateral damage, and enhance survivability.  \n\nAutonomous Vehicles: effort will identify, prototype, and assess the use in a variety of combat and supporting use employments, vehicles capable of sensing their environment, while navigating and functioning independently without human conduction to take evasive or defensive action and avoid detection, tracking, targeting or attack, provide an alternative reconnoiter capability in non-permissive settings for the purpose of mapping and patrolling for the purpose of intensifying combat power and reducing risk to the force.\n\nTactical Information Warfare:  effort will identify, prototype, and assess various information systems that provide small unit ability to undermine local opposing force information quality, while ensuring friendly forces a timely, accurate, superior capability to automatically correlate relevant active and passive information from organic and non-organic sensors that will increase their combat effectiveness in this emerging war-fighting discipline.  \n\nUrban Engagement Systems:  effort will identify, prototype and assess small unit systems to provide them enhanced situational awareness to locate and track opposing forces in tall buildings, narrow alleys, sewage tunnels and subway systems in order to minimize friendly force exposure, reduce potential collateral damage, and offer increased force protection measures by means of amplified  lethality, improved discrimination ability, and enhances survivability.\n\nFY20 efforts include Fight the Naval Force Forward, Human Performance Augmentation, and Organic Resource Generation.  These efforts are linked to USMC specific warfighting strategies, the National Defense Strategy, the Marine Operating Concept, and the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab Campaign Plan.  These policy and strategy linkages insure these efforts will be focused on the proper priorities.  \n\nThe Fight the Naval Force Forward effort will identify, prototype, and assess systems that provide critical capabilities for small task organized units operating as the forward edge of an inside force.  Efforts includes active and passive systems that operate with resilience in a Network-Contested Environment (NCE) and smaller, dispersed, and resilient systems which operate from diverse platforms.\n\nThe Human Performance Augmentation effort will identify, prototype, and assess various wearables that enhance physical and or cognitive capabilities of the individual Marine that will increase their combat effectiveness. System efforts include exoskeletons, man-machine, and artificial intelligence interfaces to enhance performance including close combat lethality in complex terrain. \n\nThe Organic Resource Generation effort will identify, prototype and assess personal and small unit systems in optionally mounted configurations that enable creation of various classes of supply to extend operational endurance and reduce logistical reliance.  Organic Resource Generation efforts include decentralized energy generation, water recycling and desalination, energy storage, increase deployed energy efficiency, bio-fuels, and non-commercially dependent distributed logistics."

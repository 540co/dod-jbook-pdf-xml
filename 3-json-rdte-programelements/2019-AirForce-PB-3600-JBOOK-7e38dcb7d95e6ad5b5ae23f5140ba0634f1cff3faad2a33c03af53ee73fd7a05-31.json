Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) Weather Systems is a component of SBEM efforts to develop capabilities to satisfy weather Gap 1 (Cloud Characterization) and Gap 2 (Theater Weather Imagery). The earliest possible launch options are being integrated in the design for critical gaps.\n\nBased on the SBEM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) results, the EO\/IR Weather Systems initial thrusts will enable:\n1) DoD use of data collected by civil, international and other DoD space systems;\n2) Weather System Follow-on Geostationary (WSF-G) efforts to include residual Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) relocation planning and engineering assessment;\n3) Timely weather collection of WSF EO\/IR (WSF-E) Program of Record;\n4) Explore and\/or utilize the use of commercially available data.\n\nSecondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the SBEM AoA and validated by the JROC.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EO\/IR Weather Systems weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

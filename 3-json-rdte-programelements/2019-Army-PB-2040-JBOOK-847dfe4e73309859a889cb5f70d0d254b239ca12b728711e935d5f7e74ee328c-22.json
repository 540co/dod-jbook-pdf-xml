Project 101 matures software, algorithms, services and devices to more effectively integrate MC across all echelons and enable more effective utilization of Warfighter resources including intelligent power management and distribution through accelerated information to decisions and rapid MC on the move. Project 243 matures and demonstrates signal processing and information\/intelligence fusion software, algorithms, services and systems for Army sensors; radio frequency (RF) systems to track and identify enemy forces and personnel; and multi-sensor control and correlation software and algorithms to improve reconnaissance, surveillance, tracking, and target acquisition.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602303A (Missile Technology), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), and PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and is coordinated with PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This Project also includes: the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (US Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill); partially funds the Five Power Senior National Representatives, Army (SNR (A)), the Technical Cooperative Program, Bilateral SNR(A)s, and Army armaments working groups with many nations."

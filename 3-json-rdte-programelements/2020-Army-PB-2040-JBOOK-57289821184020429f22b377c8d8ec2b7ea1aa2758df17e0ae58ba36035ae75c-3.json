            "val": "The Screening Obscuration Module (SOM) will increase platform survivability and soldier protection levels of maneuver forces by degrading enemy forces ability to detect US targets.  The use of battlefield obscuration is a time-tested military tactic to protect personnel, vehicles, equipment, and structures from detection; and to screen the locations, activities, and actions of friendly forces. Commanders who employ obscuration enjoy greater tactical success, freedom of maneuver, and force protection. The SOM assists the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) in retaining freedom of maneuver, conducting breaching operations, breaking contact with the enemy during security operations, and deceiving the enemy of the BCT's intentions. The SOM accomplishes this by degrading enemy forces ability to detect US targets in the visual and near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The SOM will provide a man portable mountable and dismountable medium area visual screening obscuration capability that can be applied to manned combat platforms and unmanned robotic systems. The individual Soldier or team will employ the SOM devices on open and complex terrain as part of cross-domain obscuration effects synchronized with land and air maneuver during cross-domain windows of advantage. \n\nJUONS CC-0557 provides an enhanced early warning, detection, and identification of Chemical Warfare Agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) to existing integrated base defense systems.  These capabilities are in support of Operation Inherent Resolve and will be fully integrated into the Integrated Base Defense-Kits at 10 Forward Operating Bases in Iraq.\n\nChemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Integrated Early Warning (IEW) requirements detailed in PACOM ONS 17-22580 (HQDA validated in Jan 2018). The capability developed in support of ONS 17-22580, will provide enhancements and integrated CBRN defense sensors to provide early warning of CBRN attacks and events, supplemented with decision support software. Increasing the level of confidence of information to the Commander, facilitating their ability to make critical, time sensitive decisions with high confidence and low regret to mitigate and manage the impacts of CBRN hazards."

AEGIS Baseline 9 capability package 2015 (AEGIS BL 9 2015) includes new technology and capabilities to replace aging MIL-SPEC equipment, extend service life, and maintain the combat viability of AEGIS ships into the future. AEGIS BL 9 2015 has been installed during modernization availabilities to DDG 51-53, 57, 61, 65 and 69 and CG 59, 60, 62 and also introduced on new construction destroyers (DDG 113-118). \n\nAEGIS Baseline 9 capability packages 2018, 2020, and 2021 (AEGIS BL 9 2018, 2020, 2021) will deliver additional warfighter improvements to the AEGIS Fleet to include improved Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities (DDG only), SEWIP BLK II, MH-60R Integration, SPQ-9B in the Fire Control Loop, Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC), Condition Based Maintenance, Combat System Boundary Defense, NIFC-CA 2019, and NIFC-CA Collateral #3. AEGIS BL 9 2018 will be delivered (including back-fit) to 15 DDGs (51\/52\/57\/61\/65\/69\/80\/113-120), 7 CGs (52-58) and 2 AEGIS ASHORE (AA) sites (Poland\/Romania); AEGIS BL 2020 will initially be delivered to 2 DDGs (79\/83) and 7 CGs (63-65\/66\/68\/69\/71); and AEGIS BL 9 2021 will be delivered to 12 DDGs (81\/84-88\/92\/94\/121-124, 127).\n\nAEGIS Baseline 10 capability package 2023 (AEGIS BL 10 2023) will provide critical warfighter improvements to the AEGIS FLT III Destroyers. AEGIS BL 10 2023 combat system development efforts include integration of the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) SPY-6 while building upon AEGIS BL 9 to form the foundation for the AEGIS Flight III DDG Combat System. \n\nAEGIS Far Term Interoperability Improvement Plan (FTIIP) addressed interoperability issues within fielded AEGIS Combat System configurations.\n\nAEGIS Task Force Cyber Awakening effort assesses and delivers design improvements to AEGIS Combat System Computer Program and Hardware configurations to counter emerging cyber threats. These improvements are implemented within AEGIS Combat Systems configurations currently under development and include updates to Boundary Defense Components (BDC).\nAEGIS BL 5 capability package 2020 (AEGIS BL 5 2020) combines AEGIS BL 5 and BMD 4.1 into single AEGIS Computer Program enabling near simultaneous shift between AAW and BMD operations for the AEGIS Flight I\/II DDGs as well as a combined Air and Ballistic Missile Defense capability. Additional capabilities delivered with AEGIS BL 5 2020 include SM-6 integration, as well as capabilities developed to address Fleet Urgent Operational Needs (UONs). \n\nAEGIS BL 5 capability package 2023 (AEGIS BL 5 2023) includes refurbishment of the SPY-1D radar arrays with installation of Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) to improve radar sensitivity against emerging threats through the end of the Flight I\/II DDG service life.\n\nAEGIS IFF MODE 4\/5 Integration program addresses IFF Mode 4 issues and fully integrates Mode 5 IFF for all AEGIS Baselines by 2020 in support of Fleet direction.\n\nCombat Systems Test Bed (CSTB) will address the current limitations in AEGIS Modeling & Simulation highlighted by DOT&E in previous AEGIS baselines.  Combat Systems Test Bed will provide automated analysis to efficiently process large amounts of M&S data. The CSTB has already been used to aid in the modeling and simulation of combat systems performance prior to the execution of every AEGIS Baseline 9 live fire testing since JAN 2015 and has a proven track record of realistic predictions and the identification of mission critical software defects.  CSTB is already being utilized to predict AEGIS Baseline 9 2018 system performance on Cruisers and Destroyers, and has already run over 145,000 missile scenarios, with an associated cost avoidance of $584M. The CSTB helps save on the use of targets and weapons required during live fire tests of new Combat Systems capabilities. DOT&E requires use of CSTB as noted in DOT&E letter dated Aug 09, 2013 and Jun 09, 2014.  CSTB will continue to be used by IWS1 with expanded capabilities in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and by Commander Operational Test and Evaluation Force for AEGIS BL 9 Critical Operational Issue evaluations in 2022. The CSTB will be a critical system for Frigate Combat System and AEGIS BL 10 2023."

CSTB is already being utilized to predict AEGIS Baseline 9 2018 system performance on Cruisers and Destroyers, over 145,000 missile scenarios have already been executed, with an associated cost avoidance of $584M. The CSTB helps save on the cost of targets and weapons required during live fire tests of new Combat Systems capabilities. DOT&E requires use of CSTB as noted in DOT&E letter dated Aug 09, 2013 and Jun 09, 2014.  CSTB will continue to be used by IWS1 and by Commander Operational Test and Evaluation Force for AEGIS BL 9 Critical Operational Issue evaluations in 2022. The CSTB will be a critical system for Frigate Combat System and AEGIS BL 10 2023. CSTB Build 1 has been completed as a prototype with 6 more build planned to provide more functionality to improve predictive analysis and reduce at-sea test requirements."

After the combat system is completed and tested, the computer program and associated equipment are delivered to the new construction shipbuilders and modernization shipyards where the computer program and equipment are installed and tested along with all other elements of the shipboard combat system and associated combat support systems. The computer program is a Government Furnished Computer Program (GFCP) deliverable to the Production Test Center for equipment test and check out.

These enhancements will address current and future training requirements by implementing new functionality to enable the individual warfighter through distributed battle group events to engage in more complex training requirements to support fleet required training certification events. Capability Development and integration are related to Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Underwater, Surface, and other warfare areas. Capability enhancements and upgrades include development of re-useable common components that can be leveraged by SSDS MK2 combat systems, and\/or integration of re-usable common components developed by the TSTC Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT) Program and Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) MK2 TSTC Training Improvement programs to meet AEGIS combat system training requirements. TSTC provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict, realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas (e.g. NIFC-CA and BMD missions to support IAMD). TSTC provides ships' Commanding Officers and Battle Group\/Battle Force Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Organization, the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F Fleet Synthetic Trainers (FSTs).   TSTC continues to integrate and update, as new tactical capabilities are being introduced, to enable crew operator proficiency training for basic and sustainment level training events, through distributed strike group certification fleet synthetic training (FST) events and including COMPTUEX FST at Sea integration into Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) environment.  Continued Development is required to integrate new capabilities and interfaces to provide training for AEGIS and SSDS combat system capability upgrades, and to address the Fleet's Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) Fleet Training Wholeness initiative.  Additionally, modernization is needed to support the DoD Training Transformation Plan, the Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Response Plan and Commander United States Fleet Forces Command Fleet Readiness Training Plan.\n\nThe Advanced Training Domain (ATD) is being developed to combine BFTT and the AEGIS Combat Training System (ACTS) into a common system that integrates with AEGIS BL 9.2.2AF, and SSDS BL 11.xAF.  ATD is being hosted along with the AEGIS and SSDS combat system on TI-16 common processing and display hardware.  ATD is being designed to be the core of the Total Ship Training Capability, and is projected to be more reliable, simpler to use, and architected to be extensible to meet interoperability and capability enhancement challenges in the future.\n\nThe BFTT is being updated to maintain integration and capability enhancements developed for the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), and the Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC), and SSDS Fire Control Loop Improvement Program.\n\nTSTC provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict, realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas (e.g. NIFC-CA and BMD missions to support IAMD). TSTC provides ships' Commanding Officers and Battle Group\/Battle Force Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Organization, the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F FST\/LVC events.\n\nDevelop and integrate MH-60R simulator to enable embedded shipboard training in support of basic and sustainment training, as well as establishes the pathway to support pier-side Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) events.\n\nDevelop and Integrate Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Enhanced Training (CET) to support basic and sustainment level training, as well as provide ability to distribute and establish CEC data link during pier-side fleet synthetic training exercises.  CET will also provide enable proficiency training of NIFC-CA capability.\n\nDevelop and integrate CEC Interim Training (CIT) capability to support pier-side fleet synthetic training events.  This is an interim capability support the distributed portion of the CET capability, until CET is fully deployed.  This supports training of strike groups of new tactical capabilities that were integrated into the AEGIS BL9 ships, and provides the necessary functionality to allow ships to train as a strike group.\n\nDevelop and integrate upgrades to Battle-Force Electronic Warfare Trainer (BEWT) to support soft kill training with NULKA.\n\nDevelop Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) simulator to enable training of Modes 1, 2, 3A, 4, C, 5 and S on both AEGIS and SSDS ships.  Capability will support AEGIS and SSDS IFF MODE 4\/5 Integration program will address training Mode 4 Inoculation, and allow training of Modes 5 and S IFF.\n\nDevelop and integrate commensurate training improvements to SSDS ACB 20 for Enhanced Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and Electronic Warfare (EW) tactical improvements.\n\nIntegrate Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) networking and cyber security upgrades maintain authorization to participate in distributed shipboard training events.\n\nTSTC integrated on AEGIS provides the capability to complete system and operational level testing of the combat system."

The program will replace the current fleet of M109 Family of Vehicles (FoV) consisting of the M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzer and M992A2 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV). PIM is an Army Modernization Program that addresses a critical capability gap created by the Non-Line of Sight Cannon termination in June of 2009 as well as obsolescence and Space, Weight,and Power (SWAP) issues in the M109 FoV current fleet. The PIM system integrates current Bradley Fighting Vehicle suspension and drive train items, Future Combat Systems (FCS) developed Electric Gun Drive systems and current fleet (M109A6) fire control systems into a new chassis providing better force protection, survivability and increases in electrical power over the current fleet. PIM is a two vehicle system:  The M109A7 Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and the M992A3 Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT).  The SPH has all characteristics listed above.  The CAT utilizes all of these same components and traits except those related directly to the cannon system. The PIM system replaces the current M109 FoV on a one for one basis, in the cannon fires battalions in the Armored Brigade Combat Team Formations and the Echelons above Brigade (EAB). The overall intent is to increase Soldier force protection, vehicle survivability, provide an appropriate amount of SWAP capacity to add future capabilities, increase vehicle reliability, reduce life cycle costs and extend the life of the M109 FoV through FY 2050."

The reduced funding level from FY 16 to FY 17 reflects the culmination of the test events and writing of the test reports, addressing any issues discovered during test and the shift of the actual IOT&E test event into the 1st QTR FY17.  These events will be conducted at various test sites throughout the US including Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG), Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), and the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC).  Software Phase III maintenance and Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) development will also be conducted this year.  New Equipment Training (NET) Programs of Instruction (POI) development and execution to support IOT&E will be accomplished this year.

Subsequent work directives were awarded under BAE STS contract W56HZV-07-C-0256 to further define the configuration of the PIM vehicles.  On 14 August 2009, a Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Contract W56HZV-09-C-0550 was awarded to BAE Systems Inc. for the Prototype Development and Fabrication of 7 prototype vehicles (5 PIM Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) Systems and 2 PIM Carrier Ammunition, Tracked (CAT) vehicles).  A Comprehensive Contract Modification (CCM) award to the RDT&E contract was accomplished on 6 January 2012.  This modification allows for the completion of the design engineering and initial developmental test portion of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and transfers the system responsibility for the program from the Government to BAE Systems Inc.   An additional modification to the EMD contract was awarded on 18 July 2014 to extend the contract until 31 March 2017 to cover contractor support to Production Qualification Testing (PQT), the Logistics Demonstration, and Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E).  The awarded Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract is of a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contract type for procurement of vehicles with a period of performance running from November 2013 through approximately June 2019.  The LRIP contract will provide for three LRIP years with the initial base year including 19 SPHs and 18 CATs and the remaining three option years with 18 sets, 30 sets and 48 sets, respectively (each set consisting of one each SPH and CAT) of PIM vehicles.  The Full Rate Production (FRP) contract is planned as a FPIF contract with the option to convert to a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract after the first year of FRP.  The FRP contract provides for the remaining PIM vehicles to fulfill the requirement up to the Army Acquisition Objective of 580 sets."

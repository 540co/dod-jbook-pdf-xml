            "val": "MISSION:\nThe  Technology Insertion Program for Savings (TIPS) transitions technology from any source, including those not traditionally associated with defense technology. An effective and robust integration of commercial and military technologies can reduce costs by keeping pace with the fast moving changes in technologies and operational needs. The TIPS program is structured to bring transition deals to closure quickly, and to provide execution year funding for a quick start, bridging the gap until the program of record can fund the completion of the technology insertion.\n\nThe mission of the TIPS program is to increase the rate that new cutting edge technologies are inserted into DON acquisition programs in order to significantly reduce operations and maintenance support costs. Opportunities occur when a sufficiently mature technology is identified that can meet a particular need on a timetable which matches that of an acquisition program, and is supported by a business case which justifies the associated cost and schedule risk. The combination of circumstances which create such opportunities can appear, and disappear, well inside the normal budget cycle. This program is designed to be proactive in identifying opportunities and to work with resource sponsors, fleet and force users, and Program Managers (PMs) in constructing viable technology transition deals, one at a time. To ensure the widest possible awareness of emergent commercial technology opportunities, this program interacts with the industry and coordinates closely with Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) to maintain awareness of insertion opportunities. Utilizing existing authorities, TIPS applies execution year funds where necessary to \"jump-start\" transitions so they can be inserted and validated leading directly to deployment and\/or demonstrations of high risk\/high payoff technologies. This Program Element is the only Navy program that addresses current opportunities to reduce operations and support (O&S) cost drivers within a 18-24 month period. As such, planning and initiation are accomplished within the same fiscal year, which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program. The program therefore does not meet traditional expenditure benchmarks for the first year of execution, but rapidly recovers in the second year."

            "val": "Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT, federated weapon system (AN\/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites and other collection systems.  \n\nAF DCGS is designed to support Joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements and supports the \"kill chain\u201d across the full range of military operations. Currently, AF DCGS is composed of eight core sites (two active duty worldwide, three active duty regional and three Air National Guard regional), three remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, six SIGINT Distributed Mission Sites (four collocated with National Mission Partner), three Air National Guard full-motion video sites, three support sites, three training sites, and three integration and test sites. AF DCGS currently supports ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS-based locations. AF DCGS provides integrated ISR by providing quality, fused Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.\n\nIn alignment with DoD and AF direction, AF DCGS is migrating to an open architecture (OA DCGS) to rapidly incorporate new technologies and tools to easily integrate new and\/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as provide improved mission applications to meet emerging and urgent operational needs. AF DCGS integrates commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf services and applications to the maximum extent possible to fulfill operational requirements and data sharing requirements across the DoD DCGS community.   The next iteration will involve transitioning to a hybrid cloud (mix of private on premise and public cloud) architecture.\n\nProgram management consists of five ACAT III efforts: GEOINT Transformation, SIGINT Transformation, Multi-INT, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT)\n\n1. GEOINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new GEOINT capabilities, enables quick\/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, and command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.\n\n2. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new SIGINT capabilities, enables quick\/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates SIGINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.\n\n3. Multi-INT-1: Rapidly integrates new and updated enterprise applications, to include voice\/video\/chat communications, collaboration and situational awareness, multi-INT fusion, and data analytics capabilities into the open architecture framework.  Also includes Intelligent Modeling and Predictive Analysis of Cyberspace Targeting (IMPACT) program, which develops concepts, Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing ISR and non-kinetic capabilities.  Addressees program office test and evaluation activities.\n\n4. Network Infrastructure Transformation: Modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, commercial-based, architecture, improving data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery. OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture and public cloud represents the AF DCGS hybrid cloud (mix of private on premise and public cloud) architecture.\n\n5. *DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.\nNOTE:\n*No additional RDT&E or Investment Funding planned in FY20 or outyears; ACAT will be closed once the capability is installed at all sites\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

GEOINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new GEOINT capabilities, enables quick\/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, and command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.\n\n2. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new SIGINT capabilities, enables quick\/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates SIGINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.\n\n3. Multi-INT-1: Rapidly integrates new and updated enterprise applications, to include voice\/video\/chat communications, collaboration and situational awareness, multi-INT fusion, and data analytics capabilities into the open architecture framework.  Also includes Intelligent Modeling and Predictive Analysis of Cyberspace Targeting (IMPACT) program, which develops concepts, Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing ISR and non-kinetic capabilities.  Addressees program office test and evaluation activities.\n\n4. Network Infrastructure Transformation: Modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, commercial-based, architecture, improving data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery. OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture and public cloud represents the AF DCGS hybrid cloud (mix of private on premise and public cloud) architecture.\n\n5. *DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.\n\nNOTE:\n*No additional RDT&E or Investment Funding planned in FY20 or out-years; ACAT will be closed once the capability is installed at all sites.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

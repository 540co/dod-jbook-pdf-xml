            "val": "The Air Tactical Applications (AOTA) Program Element (PE) is aligned with the Navy's maritime strategy to enhance the future mission capabilities of the Navy-Marine Corps Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Team supporting naval warfighters worldwide.  New state-of-the art government and commercial technologies are identified, transitioned, demonstrated and then integrated into Combat Systems and programs of record to provide capabilities that provide real-time and near-real-time operational effects of the physical environment on the performance of combat forces and their new and emerging platforms, sensors, systems and munitions.  The AOTA program element focuses on sensing and characterizing and predicting the littoral and deep-strike battlespace in the context of regional conflicts and crisis response scenarios.  \n\nProjects in this PE transition state-of-the art sensing, assimilation, modeling and decision aid technologies from government and commercial sources.  Unique project development efforts include atmospheric and oceanographic data assimilation techniques, forecast models, data base management systems and associated software for use in mainframe, desktop and laptop computers.  Model data, products and services can be used by forward-deployed personnel or in a reach-back mode to optimize sensor placement and force allocation decisions.  Global Geospatial Information and Services efforts within this program address the bathymetric needs of the Navy.  Also developed are algorithms to process new satellite sensor data for integration into Navy and Marine Corps decision support systems and for display as part of the common operational and tactical pictures.  In addition, the projects provide for demonstration and validation of specialized atmospheric and oceanographic instrumentation and measurement techniques, new sensors, communications and interfaces.  Included are new capabilities to assess, predict and enhance the performance of current and emerging undersea warfare and mine warfare weapons systems.  AOTA capabilities are designed to support the latest versions of the Global Command and Control System and specific unit-level combat systems.  This PE develops technological upgrades for the U.S. Naval Observatory's Master Clock system to meet requirements of Department of Defense communications, cryptographic, intelligence, geolocation, and targeting systems; develops near-real-time earth orientation predictions; develops very precise determination of positions of both faint and bright stars; and supports satellite tracking and space debris studies.  \n\nMajor emphasis areas include the Naval Integrated Tactical Environmental System Next Generation (NITES-Next) and the METOC Data Acquisition, the METOC Data Assimilation & Modeling, the Precise Timing and Astrometry, the Fleet Synthetic Training, the Tactical Environmental Support, Decision Support Products & Dissemination, the Earth System Prediction Capability projects, and the Remote Sensing Capability Development.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The need to accurately characterize dynamic conditions are crucial in planning and executing warfare operations and effectively allocating force weapon and sensor systems.  Routinely available data sources, such as climatology, oceanographic and meteorological numerical models are necessary but not sufficient to support the littoral and deep strike regions.  Operational sensors are deployed great distances from the target area of interest.  The challenge is to collect and disseminate METOC data in variable and dynamic littoral environmental conditions or in denied, remote or inaccessible areas over extended periods of time. \n\nThis project: 1) provides the means to rapidly and automatically acquire a broad array of METOC data using off-board and on-board sensors; 2) provides an on-scene assessment capability for the tactical commander; 3) provides the tactical commander with real-time METOC data and products for operational use; 4) demonstrates and validates the use of tactical workstations and desktop computers for processing and display of METOC data and products; 5) demonstrates and validates techniques which employ data compression, connectivity and interface technologies to obtain, store, process, distribute and display these METOC data and products; 6) develops new charting and bathymetric survey techniques necessary to reduce the existing shortfall in coastal hydrographic survey requirements; 7) develops an expanded database for predictive METOC models in areas of interest; and 8) supports the development of radar weather using through-the-sensor techniques.

The Navy's mission continues to require focus on blue-water operations, littoral and deep-strike (inland) battlespaces.  Each of these operating areas (and the transitions between them) has its own dynamic and complex environmental characteristics and behaviors that require modifying METOC Collections and associated sensing strategies and methodologies.  Without reliable characterization of ocean and atmosphere in these operating areas, the Navy risks ineffective allocation and employment of warfighters and weapon systems, and the sensors that fully enable them.  Fleet Naval METOC has updated the definition and structure of the METOC program along the lines of operational mission needs.  This update focuses on the operational characteristics of Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) of METOC data and information. Identified efforts supporting METOC are realigned to projects and activities that align to the TCPED updated program structure."

In part 2 (FY19), a representative sample of SPIRE data (which includes at a minimum two contiguous days of data) acquired and ingested into an ionospheric data assimilative model.  The performance of the model runs with SPIRE data will be compared to the performance of model runs without SPIRE data to demonstrate the overall impact of the data.  Since it is anticipated that the volume of SPIRE data will grow substantially, the impact of the SPIRE data will be measured as a function of the density of SPIRE data samples in the vicinity of the independent ionospheric observations.  This will provide for an estimation of the utility of larger constellations of SPIRE satellites with higher sample densities than the representative SPIRE data used in this study.\n\nConclude the effort to Collect in-situ transmission loss (TL) from tactical platforms in support of Naval Oceanographic Office's (NAVOCEANO's) Low Frequency Bottom Loss (LFBL) database that developed efficient algorithm to perform inversion of TL data to produce geo-acoustic parameters of the local environment."

These models gain increasing importance as weapons and sensors grow in sophistication and complexity, making them all the more sensitive to the effects of the natural environment.

METOC Processing efforts must also rise to the challenge of assimilating smaller-scale phenomena, particularly in the littorals, and predicting their spatial and temporal effects, as stated by Fleet and Force Commanders who require remote autonomous, clandestine, littoral battlespace sensing in near-shore areas to enable Sea Shield & Sea Basing.

Stennis Space Center (SSC)).  Transition will include a Validation Test Report.  The majority of the required labor is associated with preparation of this report.  NRL will also assist FNMOC with Operational Test (OPTEST).\nComplete:  Leverage a coupled ocean and atmospheric modeling and assimilation system based on Coupled Ocean\/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS), Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) and a range-dependent acoustic model (RAM).  Operationalize the forward coupled ocean-acoustic system at Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO)\/FNMOC which will provide a number of advantages over current capabilities.  Reduce runtime for acoustic simulations, reduce error due to the coupling of the models, reduce manpower due to the automation, and provide uncertainty estimates via uband.\nComplete:  Develop and transition to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) the Navy Ionosphere Model for Operations (NIMO), which consists of a physics-based model of the ionosphere and a data assimilation capability that will provide a real-time electron density specification on a global grid with the ability to specify high-resolution configurable regional grids.  NIMO will also provide a 24-hour forecast of electron density climatology.  The Ionospheric Data Assimilation 4-D (IDA4D) will be coupled with the Navy's Highly Integrated Thermosphere\/Ionosphere Demonstration System (Navy-HITIDES) to form NIMO.  NIMO and associated data preprocessors will be optimized to run efficiently on the Navy DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRC).  NIMO will form the basis of a future Navy operational ionospheric forecasting system, running at multiple resolutions and fully coupled to operational atmospheric forecast models.\nComplete:  Develop, test, and transition for operational implementation a strongly coupled ocean-atmosphere 4D-Var assimilation system for COAMPS.  The new system will provide a unique capability that enables the observations from the atmosphere (ocean) to directly improve the analysis\/forecast in the ocean (atmosphere).  The US Navy will own the superior capability of accurately and efficiently characterizing the battlespace environment at the ocean-atmosphere interface once the proposed system becomes operational.  The coupled DA system will be demonstrated in COAMPS-OS (on-scene) and verified with propagation products as well as traditional metrics.\nComplete:  Substantially increase the skill of the COAMPS-TC (tropical cyclone) model in the prediction of rapid intensification (RI) events and inner-core structure (6.4), and to elucidate the nature of the relationship between inner-core structure and TC intensification prediction and predictability (6.2).   Our approach includes (1) Model development Resolution increases and physics improvements for COAMPS-TC, (2) Data assimilation New capabilities for initializing COAMPS-TC, (3) TC structure guidance development structure assessment and prediction, (4) TC forecast post-processing exploiting statistically-corrected RI forecasts for increased skill.  Through a synergistic combination of advancements to the COAMPS-TC model, the data assimilation system used to initialize the model, and the aids utilized by the operational warning centers to estimate TC inner-core structure characteristics (subsequently fed into the COAMPS-TC initial state), we aim to address the #1 research priority of both Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and National Hurricane Center (NHC) Rapid intensification prediction.\nComplete:  Develop and transition a global ensemble aerosol prediction system, including data assimilation, to FNMOC.  This system will provide a new probabilistic aerosol prediction and product capability for enhanced aerosol data assimilation and downstream Electro-Optical (EO) attenuation modeling.  This work leverages BA2 (budget activity 2) efforts that helped optimize the use of ensemble data assimilation methods for aerosol prediction.  The Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (ENAAPS) system and Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) were ported and tested on Navy DSRC machines as a near-real-time (NRT) system and implemented using Cylc (Cylc [pronounced silk] is a workflow engine for cycling systems - it orchestrates distributed suites of interdependent cycling tasks that may continue to run indefinitely).  Under the Rapid Transition Project (RTP), the system will be thoroughly tested for NRT applications with a focus on how the ensemble performs in the forecast, including the ensemble mean and spread.  Means for improving system performance will also be tested and implemented as part of NRT ENAAPS, including bias correction, new observations for assimilation, and evaluation of the NAVGEM ensemble impact on ENAAPS forecasts.\nComplete:  Develop and test a Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA) -based capability for forward platforms (NCODA-forward) to assimilate collected oceanographic data (e.g. eXpendable BathyThermographs (XBTs), glider, etc.\/temperature, salinity, etc.) into an oceanographic model field (NCOM or Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM)) in an acoustically consistent way for operational and tactical analysis and predictions.  The proposed capability will provide an estimate of the uncertainty associated with the assimilation process that allows the user to know when the process is reliable and flag cases where the model data cannot be appropriately reconciled with respect to the observations.  Production of such uncertainty fields will be used to derive sampling plans to confirm or exclude suspected outliers and reduce excessive uncertainty.  Supporting capabilities must also be developed as part of the system to improve compression algorithms to allow more data (temperature, salinity, wind, model error estimates) to be sent to forward platforms and to provide capabilities to assess acoustic integrity of the assimilation process for frequencies of interest.\nComplete:  Implement middle atmosphere processes into a fully coupled global atmosphere\/wave\/ocean\/land\/ice prediction system providing daily predictions out to 16 days, weekly predictions out to 32 days and weekly ensemble predictions to 90 days.  Predictions will provide environmental information to meet Navy and Department of Defense (DoD) operations and planning needs throughout the globe from undersea to the upper atmosphere and from the tropics to the poles. The system will be implemented on Navy operational computer systems, and the necessary processing infrastructure will be put in place to provide products for Navy fleet user consumption.\nDevelop an improved algorithm for estimating near-shore bathymetry from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery that would be incorporated into NAVO's operational implementation (using future Commander Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (CNMOC) funding).  Algorithm improvements have been identified under previous work funded by NRL and CNMOC, and shown to perform significantly better than the existing operational capability on a small test set.  The goal of this program is to incorporate those improvements into a single system suitable for transition and test it on a larger range of operational data.  Specific tasks of this program, based on previously developed improvements, would be (1) incorporate a dynamic box capability based on instantaneous wave parameters; (2) incorporate an automated wave group amplitude metric to determine when to use bathymetry estimates within small spatial extents; (3) determine source and mitigation of wave noise in new \"Undispersion\" algorithm; (4) perform validation studies using existing test sets; and (5) write report for NAVO implementation.\n\nTest assimilation of updated Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) derived swath ice concentration from NOAA-20 VIIRS and AMSR2 into the GOFS 3.1 system.  Investigate ability to assimilate sea ice thickness observations and transition into NCODA system.  Test sea ice thickness assimilation in GOFS 3.1 and GOFS 3.5 systems.  Establish a geologically consistent physics-based seafloor prediction capability coupled with existing operational oceanic and atmospheric prediction systems.  This seafloor prediction capability, based on the NRLs Global Predictive Seafloor Model (GPSM) foundation, will produce a geologically and geo-acoustically consistent replacement for the current high-frequency bottom loss (HFBL) values at any point on the seafloor for transition to NAVO.  Characterize forecast dropouts, based on 500mb Anomaly Correlation (AC) methods, in the Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM), including forecast statistics, common properties and causes.  Develop and implement a fully coupled global atmosphere\/wave\/ocean\/land\/ice prediction system providing daily high- resolution deterministic 16-day and lower-resolution ensemble predictions at longer lead times.  Optimize scripting for the deterministic and ensemble systems to better manage cycling tasks for model components and data assimilation, resulting in increased modularity, better parallelism, easier debugging through error trapping, and greater reuse.  Develop an ensemble prediction system for a fully coupled global atmosphere\/wave\/ocean\/land\/sea ice coupled model for predictions out to 90 days.  Develop a fully- coupled data assimilation capability to optimize the use of the observations across fluid interfaces, eliminating the transient inconsistences, increasing forecast skill and representing coupled uncertainties.  Evaluate and demonstrate the capabilities of a new generation of atmospheric dynamical systems that allow for variable resolution on the sphere, are highly scalable, and eliminate or mitigate spurious problems near the poles of the globe. \nFurther develop, validate, and evaluate the capability of a fully coupled regional Arctic prediction system.  Develop, integrate, and test improvements to the computational performance of models within the Navy global coupled forecast system as well as the coupling infrastructure to ensure that operational partners will meet their production schedules using available computational resources.  Improve capabilities for supporting long range Navy planning (lead times of one week and longer).  Develop and transition for operational implementation a high resolution global weather prediction system NAVGEM with resolution of approximately T1023L100 (13 km horizontal resolution and 100 vertical layers) that is highly competitive in predictive skill with other operational global numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems.  Define, develop, and implement consistent quantitative skill metrics to assess the advancements in the Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC), taking into account the applications and lead-times for which the ESPC environmental information will be used.  Evaluate and validate multi-model extended-range forecasts produced from interagency projects such as the North American Multi-model Ensemble (NMME).  Develop the NAVGEM global model to include inline aerosols to simulate aerosol life cycle and perform aerosol direct radiative heating of the atmosphere.  Participate in the NMME by re-forecasting the global coupled (NAVGEM-HYCOM- Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE)) Navy ESPC model for years 1999 to 2015.  Accelerate the rate of improvement in the US National ESPC and National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC), focusing primarily on the current and future generation global modeling enterprise. Develop the NAVGEM global model to address middle atmosphere processes associated with sudden stratospheric warming and extended range prediction."

Tasks are directed toward advanced software enabling assimilation of disparate sources on non-synoptic time scales.  Acoustic, atmospheric, and oceanographic model development, prototyping and transition is focused on improved model physics, increased resolution, and computational efficiency.\nMetric: Tasks will address no less than 75% of applicable capability gaps and requirements. \n\nGoal (ESPC): Develop a more accurate global ocean, atmosphere, wave and sea ice forecast system with longer skillful forecast times from weeks to seasons through integrating and coupling atmosphere, ocean, ice, land and near-space forecast models into a seamless deterministic and ensemble prediction system that significantly improves skill over the current modeling suite.  Additionally develop a common modeling architecture to improve cross-Agency collaboration, and greatly more efficient environmental modeling and computational architectures to allow for real-time operational prediction at comparable skill level to international competitors."

This project funds the agile software development of the Naval Integrated Tactical Environmental System Next Generation (NITES-Next) program of record.  NITES-Next program identifies and transitions state-of-the-art decision support software technologies from the government and commercial industry's technology base, and then demonstrates and validates these capabilities before fielding.  These software decision support tools provide platform, sensor, communications, and weapon systems performance assessments for warfighters in terms of their littoral and deep-strike battlespace environments.  These assessments allow mission planners and warfighters, from Unit to Theater level, to optimize their sensor employment on airborne, surface, and subsurface platforms in support of Naval Composite Warfare mission areas including Undersea Warfare (USW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare (MIW), Amphibious Warfare (AMW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Strike Warfare (STW), Expeditionary Warfare (EXW), Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Intelligence Operations (INT), Non-Combat Operations (NCO), Command, Control, Communication (CCC), and Naval Special Warfare (NSW).  Performance assessments leading to improvements in operational and tactical control are conducted through a two-tiered approach: 1) Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Decision Aids and, 2) Operational Effects Decision Aids (OEDAs).  METOC Decision Aides consist of a series of analysis tools which characterize the physical environment conditions of the battlespace based on the best set of physical environment data available at the time (i.e., some combination of historical and\/or real-time (or near real-time) in-situ, and numerically modeled forecast data).  OEDAs use the METOC Decision Aide information by fusing it with relevant, often-classified, sensor and target data to predict how weapons and sensor systems will perform.  Performance results are displayed in tabular and graphic formats integrated into net-centric visualization tools for use by mission planners, and combat\/weapon system operators to develop localization plans, USW\/AAW\/ASUW screens, STW profiles, and AMW ingress and egress points.  METOC Decision Aides and OEDAs typically use data derived from sensors developed in Project 2341 (METOC Data Acquisition) and assimilated by software produced by Project 2342 (METOC Data Assimilation and Modeling).  METOC Decision Aides and OEDAs also use data obtained through direct interfaces to Navy combat systems.  Cyber secure capabilities are a current emphasis required to characterize and\/or predict sensor and weapons system performance in the highly complex littoral environments in support of regional conflict scenarios.  It addresses multi-warfare areas, particularly shallow water ASW, NSW, and missile and air defense\/strike capabilities. \n\n\n\nFunding supports development and integration efforts for Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) systems to generate and collect METOC data and fuse multiple intelligence inputs to more robustly characterize and predict tactical atmospheric and oceanographic conditions. This integrated METOC picture will support real-time battlespace awareness of propagation conditions affecting signals across the electromagnetic spectrum. METOC data will be fused with other intelligence data and automatically provided to shipboard combat systems to inform kinetic and non-kinetic fires."

NITES-Next began initial software development of FCR 3 mobile variant, which integrates new mobile variant requirements with the previous afloat versions of FCR 2.x.  The FCR-3 mobile variant software will also include anti-tamper proofing and will be releasable to our allies to enhance our interoperability with their information warfare systems.  The new mobile variant will replace the current NITES-NEXT Naval Integrated Tactical Environmental System Fielded (NITES-Fielded) suite of systems that have been determined to have cyber vulnerabilities and need to be retired as soon as possible.  Additionally, FCR-3 will include the development of an Electromagnetic (EM) Prediction capability to be delivered in FY19\/20.  NITES-Next planned for, and conducted, System Integration Testing (SIT), System Qualification Testing(SQT), User Assessment (UA), and Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) for FCR-2 (v2.0.2) and FCR-3.  NITES-Next began deployment of FCR-2 (v2.0.1) software.  The program obtained an Authority to Operate (ATO) for Fleet Capability Release (FCR)-2.x and FCR-3 software.

The MC System and Time Transfer provides precise time for use in modern military and National Technical Means (NTM) navigation, guidance, positioning, and tracking systems. The Earth Orientation System provides precise Earth Orientation Parameters for use by the DoD and the national civilian infrastructure to establish the specific orientation of the Earth and to provide input to the terrestrial reference frame. The Astrometric Observation System provides the basic data needed to generate the Celestial Reference Frame (CRF) which is the standard for calibrating all inertial navigation systems, satellite orbits, and earth rotation determinations. Improvement to the MC System, Time Transfer, Earth Orientation, and Astrometric Observation Systems are needed to ensure that new and upgraded DoD and NTM capabilities meet their performance requirements. By DoD Directive 4650.06 and OPNAV9420.1B, the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO), is responsible for coordinating Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) requirements and for maintaining a PTTI reference standard (astronomical and atomic) for use by all DoD, federal agencies, and related scientific laboratories. The Navy is also responsible for providing CRF data for military and NTM navigation, positioning, and guidance capabilities to all DoD via DODI 4650.06 and OPNAV9420.1B. \n\nThe PTA research and development efforts are focused on several areas relating to timing and time transfer: (1) Fielding of Rubidium Fountain Atomic Clocks and development of improved Global Positioning System (GPS) Timing Receivers in order to meet the precise timing requirements for the GPS III system; (2) Research & development of the capability of distributing timing signals via Optical fiber lines, as an alternative and backup to GPS time distribution; and (3) Research & development into Optical Clock technology, which is expected to be required for future DoD systems. The PTA research and development effort is also focused on the following areas related to Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) determination: (1) Upgrade of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VBLI) data acquisition system \/ radio telescope at Kokee Park HI; (2) Development of a Software (SW) Correlator for processing of VLBI data, necessary for the generation of Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) data; (3) Development of the capability for electronic transmission of the VLBI data from remote VLBI sites to the USNO correlator. The new SW Correlator and the eVLBI infrastructure upgrades are necessary in order to support daily updates of EOP data required by GPS III; (4) Development of an automated end-to-end EOP processing system, which combines input from multiple data sets (e.g. VLBI data, GPS orbit data, and laser ranging data, etc.). Automation is necessary to meet future DoD and GPS requirements; and (5) Modifications to the EOP system for compatibility with the new international standard -'VLBI2010'.  The PTA research and development for astrometry focuses on 1) 1.8 meter telescope deployment, 2) research into the development of a GPS-denied reference frame as a navigation solution, 3) visible and infrared (IR) instrumentation development. These activities are necessary for producing CRF products for DoD customers in an era of new surveillance, targeting, intelligence, and reconnaissance technologies and instrumentation."

Upgrades to uBand include cumulative uncertainty effects, a new input front-end, and several new surface duct treatment algorithms.\n\nModifications to ray path calculations of GRAB-3D for vertical wall scenarios; convert the existing mathematical model to the proposed numerical model accounting for source bearing launch versus target bearing receiving angles; compute the acoustic pressure on a wave at the current source bearing launch angles with Caustic correction; refine\/validate CASS-3D with MODSS SDSNE dataset (obtained in Phase I Base); convert validated FORTRAN model to C++ and multi-thread.\n6) Develop and document an OAML Submission Plan (OSP), file an ECP, and submit CASS-3D to OAML to begin the approval process\n\nDevelop techniques to conduct near real-time RF channel estimation using distributed EW\/IO receivers in combination with Blue Force emitters of opportunity, and an efficient operator interface and display for interpreting the complex and rapidly changing urface EW environment. PCAP will develop a system that combines previously-developed elements, namely Refractivty Data Fusion (RDF) and Refractivity from Radio (RFR), and makes the information available to an operator in real-time.\n\nimplement Variable Resolution (VR) BAGs into its survey and production workflow, which will require the development of tools for the exploitation of this new structure.  The goal of this effort will be to provide this capability and toolset to NAVOCEANO.  The Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL) effort will include the determination of the best approach for design\/development of the tools, develop the tools, coordinate appropriate demonstrations to all required parties, and to provide software documentation to the customer.\n\nImprove the accuracy of Tactical Decision Aide (TDA) acoustic performance calculations in support of surface ship operations by reconciling Fleet sonar data with the OAML models and databases.  Conversely, the Fleet data will be used to validate and upgrade the OAML models and databases.\n\nThe objective of the effort is to improve the predicted performance of tactical weapon systems by measuring key environmental parameters in the battle space with tactical sensors.  This is to be accomplished through the development, demonstration, and transition of new Through-the-Sensor data collection, extraction, processing, and dissemination techniques.   System specifications to extract environmental data from tactical warfare sensors for use in on-scene decision aids will be developed.  Sensors will include acoustic, oceanographic, and atmospheric environmental sensors.  Data transformation goals include environmental data acquisition using advanced data processing techniques and rapid information dissemination capabilities.  Data dissemination goals include integrating and exposing sensor data across Navy enclaves.\n\nImprove accuracy and efficacy of clutter extraction algorithms and processes utilized in the creation of Clutter databases for NAVO.    Process currently utilizes AN\/SQQ-89(A) recorded data.  This task would also explore feasibility of future real time clutter extraction.\n\nGeospatially derived acoustic ground analysis has been shown to yield high correlation with acoustic signal excess range predictions generated from physics-based Transmission-Loss (TL) models.  We propose to provide a high-performance tool implementing a promising method by which the integration of empirical geospatial acoustic high\/low ground analysis may be used to optimized traditional physics-based sensor performance predictions.  These optimizations range from narrowing choices on frequency performance, sensor performance, and range within which TL is computed.\n\nThe goal of this proposed effort is to improve the accuracy and expand the capabilities of models, algorithms and databases that characterize atmospheric impacts on electromagnetic and electro-optical (EM\/EO) sensors, weapons, EW\/ES and communications systems.  Ultimately, this effort will directly help in providing U.S. warfighters with enhanced battlespace awareness to optimize Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW) decision making and planning for the current or predicted environmental conditions.  These NPS-developed models, algorithms and databases (including NAVSLaM, EDC, UADC, VRPBA, RSMA-ED, Upper-Air Cn2 models, Cn2 climatology and others) will be submitted to the CNMOC Oceanic and Atmospheric Master Library (OAML) in order to make fully tested, validated, documented and accredited products available \"off the shelf\" to U.S. DoD researchers and developers of EM\/EO prediction TDAs and systems when and as needed.  These NPS products are also disseminated to a multitude of U.S. DoD agencies and researchers prior to submission to OAML for research, development, testing and evaluation purposes.\n\nOptimize placement of unmanned oceanographic sensors for assimilation into numerical forecasts using technologies such as Guidence for Heterogeneous Observing SysTems (GHOST) developed and maintained by NRL 7300. Optimally integrate the sensor\/vehicle allocation, model performance optimization, situational awareness and overall mission planning tasks into capabilities that can be transitioned to the Glider Operations center at NAVOCEANO for use with GHOST guidance. In addition, couple functionality with TOPSIDE software such that the tactical analyst can receive authoritative environmental information to inform operational decisions and to visualize mission definition input as well as platform instruction output from GHOST.\n\nwork towards transitioning a new probabilistic aerosol forecasting system, ensemble Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (ENAAPS), to operations.  ENAAPS was previously ported to the Navy DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) computers and developed as a near-real-time (NRT) system run using Cylc with evaluation of the ensemble mean forecast.  In the proposed work, new metrics will be developed for evaluating ensemble spread and used to evaluate the NRT 5 day forecasts, bias correction code for post-processing of the ensemble mean forecast will be added to the NRT system, and new probabilistic aerosol products will be developed."

By leveraging community based tools, we can build a unified verification framework which is consistent across the suite of models and also consistent with our operational partners.  Such a framework would allow us to make use of more modern, feature based verification metrics that can assist with identification and diagnosis of specific sources of model error. In addition, this modern framework would allow NRL to better tailor our verification products to inform data assimilation and model development, as well as the needs of the end user.  Finally, a consistent model verification framework would aid in collaboration with other U.S. partners (e.g. NCEP, JEDI) who are employing the same community tools.\n\nThe goal of this project is to create a framework and supporting technologies that will enable sharing and coordination of METOC data across multiple providers, enclaves, and domains.  This includes creating a realtime master index of all model output products across multiple providers and domains, a grid generalization system that is able to pull and transform gridded model outputs from multiple sources, and a modular dissemination system that will support a wide variety of METOC data consumers. Each of these components can exist and operate at multiple nodes across agencies and network domains. extend the Adaptive Air ASW Planning and Evaluation Tool (A3PET) realtime ASW missionplanning tool to incorporate critical capabilities request by Fleet Users.  This effort will develop additional capability to the existing tool, including modeling of Active Sonobuoys, modeling buoy drift and buoy deployment latency, as well as adding in overlay import\/export functionality for more efficient MPRA mission planning.  This effort extends the A3PET MPRA mission planning tool capability delivered in FY18.migrate the OAML library, administrative, and management functions to a cloud based approach. This will provide more efficient maintenance and distribution of the databases, algorithms and models. It will also provide better compatibility with future programs.Implement wind probabilities for Southern Hemisphere, SMOS winds and fixes, RI aid upgrades or consensus upgraded into ATCF; Evaluation of FNMOC version of WAVEWATCH ensemble based on JTWC forecasts.Apply and develop machine learning methods to modeling efforts to help identify model environments and scenarios that help validate the model against measured acoustics and\/or reconstruct active acoustic events."

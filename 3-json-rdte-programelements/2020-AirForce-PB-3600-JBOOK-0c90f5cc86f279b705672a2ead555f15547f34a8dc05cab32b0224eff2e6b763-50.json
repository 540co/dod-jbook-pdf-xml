            "val": "The Armament Ordnance Development program provides for the initial and continuing development of weapons, munitions, and munitions equipment for aircraft integration, support, and operational use.  This program also provides for the development and integration of advanced position, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities (i.e. GPS, non-GPS, optical, passive, active, etc.).  This program develops, characterizes, and improves current, future, and legacy munitions, ammunitions, and subsystems. \n\n653133: The Bombs & Fuzes project improves conventional weapons\/munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic), fuzes, and height-of-burst sensors (HOBS), and develops and integrates complementary position, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities (i.e. GPS, non-GPS, optical, passive, active, etc.).  This project also provides an opportunity to quickly insert emerging technologies into existing and developing aircraft munitions and fuzes.  Bombs & Fuzes provides research, development, and testing of conventional warheads, fuzing, HOBS modifications, and anti-personnel anti-materiel (APAM) weapons to improve lethality against area, mobile, hard and deeply buried, and fixed targets.  This project provides for the development and testing necessary to provide a suitable manufacturing base of conventional warheads, fuzes, HOBS, and munitions materiel handling equipment (MMHE). \n\nIn FY2019, Joint Air-to-Ground Missile for Fixed Wing (JAGM-F) was a new start.\n\n655361: The Stores-Aircraft Interface project conducts stores-aircraft interface upgrades and standards development to include the Universal Armament Interface (UAI).  UAI is an Air Force initiative to develop standardized software interfaces in aircraft weapons and mission planning.  The savings realized from this effort is on average 6 years of schedule and $22M per aircraft\/weapon combination.  This is accomplished by enabling integration of weapons independent of aircraft Operational Flight Programs (OFP) cycles.  UAI is currently implemented on the F-15E, F-16 Block 40\/50 and European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) F-16 aircraft, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I and II, Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Laser JDAM, Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM), and Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software (PGMPS).  Planned implementation include Joint Strike Fighter (JSF\/F-35), B-21, MQ-9, JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), F\/A-18, Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile - Extended Range (AARGM-ER), Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS), SPEAR3, Joint Strike Missile (JSM), and the Turkish Stand Off Missile - Joint (SOM-J).  The UAI program office is responsible for development and enhancement of the standard, support to coalition\/allied\/joint interoperability efforts for weapons-platform interface, provision of certification tools, and implementation support to aircraft and weapons.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Armament\/Ordnance Development weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

                            "val": "The Bombs & Fuzes project improves conventional weapons\/munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic), fuzes, and height-of-burst sensors (HOBS), and develops and integrates complementary position, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities (i.e. GPS, non-GPS, optical, passive, active, etc.).  This project also provides an opportunity to quickly insert emerging technologies into existing and developing aircraft munitions and fuzes.  Bombs & Fuzes provides research, development, and testing of conventional warheads, fuzing, HOBS modifications, and anti-personnel anti-materiel (APAM) weapons to improve lethality against area, mobile, hard and deeply buried, and fixed targets. This project provides for the development and testing necessary to provide a suitable manufacturing base of conventional warheads, fuzes, HOBS, and munitions materiel handling equipment (MMHE). \n\n- Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE): MMHE is a continuing project to develop and improve the standardization and commonality of munitions handling and armament equipment to preclude duplication.  Efforts are primarily the study, design, and development of MMHE and armament control systems; however, support may be provided to other functional areas as requested.  Procurement will be performed and funded by the applicable weapons system project.\n\n- Medium Caliber Ammunition project assesses, refines, and develops medium caliber ammunition, to include, but not limited to, conducting 25mm (F-35) qualification testing, comparative testing, and mitigating ammunition inventory health issues.\n\n- Insensitive Munitions (IM) project supports AF IM strategic planning to achieve IM compliance IAW U.S. Code, Title 10, Subtitle A, Part N, Chapter 141, Section 2389, ensuring safety regarding insensitive munitions. Models and validates munition performance, integrates less sensitive explosive fills, addresses IM explosive fill deficiencies, and develops bomb case modifications to improve the response of conventional weapons to unplanned stimuli. This project explores and develops IM solutions.  \n\n- Next Generation Area Attack Weapons (NGAAWs) are a family of unitary area attack weapon capabilities to meet the DoD policy regarding cluster munitions and unintended harm to civilians.  They consist of BLU-134\/B and BLU-136\/B warheads with a height of burst sensor.  BLU-134\/B Improved Lethality Warhead (ILW), NGAAW Increment I, is a near-term solution for area attack as an anti-personnel anti-materiel (APAM) weapon that improves lethality using a 500 lb warhead design and any variants.  The BLU-136\/B NGAAW Increment II continues development to provide significantly increased capability and lethality against area targets as an APAM weapon.  This effort is being executed using an accelerated acquisition strategy to study, design, develop, and test a 2,000 lb unitary warhead design and any variants based on target sets.\n\n- Cockpit-selectable Height-Of-Burst Sensor (C-HOBS): The C-HOBS sensor will be a replacement for the current DSU-33D\/B proximity sensor. C-HOBS will replace the single factory height-of-burst setting with the addition of multiple height-of-burst options selectable via both manual switches and a cockpit interface.  These selection options allow flexibility during flight to address a wide array of targets.  The C-HOBS is intended to interface with and provide a cockpit-selectable proximity function to general and special purpose weapons.\n\n- Joint Air-to-Ground Missile for Fixed Wing Aircraft (JAGM-F) is an improvement to the Army-led JAGM which will allow the missile to be released from fixed wing aircraft in order to eliminate time sensitive moving targets and high value covered\/sheltered targets.  JAGM-F will be able to combat adverse weather\/low visibility battlefield and countermeasure environments as well as austere communication environments.  JAGM-F will have the ability to engage multiple target types near-simultaneously in multiple engagement modes.  Efforts include but are not limited to testing, qualification, and design\/build demo components to production standards.  Intent is to investigate meeting all BRU-55, BRU-57, and BRU-61 environments.\n\nIn FY2019, Joint Air-to-Ground Missile for Fixed Wing (JAGM-F) was a new start."

This strategy includes rapid development and prototyping of a warhead design resulting in a final, validated Technical Data Package (TDP). The TDP will be used to compete for initial production and follow on procurement to meet the warfighter requirement. The NGAAW program will continue to evaluate product improvements.\n\n- Joint Air-to-Ground Missile for Fixed Wing Aircraft (JAGM-F) will utilize the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) contract combined with modeling and simulation contract support and government test support."

UAI is an Air Force initiative to develop standardized software interfaces in aircraft weapons and mission planning. The savings realized from this effort is on average 6 years of schedule and $22M per aircraft\/weapon combination. This is accomplished by enabling integration of weapons independent of aircraft Operational Flight Programs (OFP) cycles. UAI is currently implemented on the F-15E, F-16 Block 40\/50 and European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) F-16 aircraft, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I and II, Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Laser JDAM, Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM), and Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software (PGMPS). Planned implementation include Joint Strike Fighter (JSF\/F-35), B-21, MQ-9, JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), F\/A-18, Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile - Extended Range (AARGM-ER), Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS), SPEAR3, Joint Strike Missile (JSM), and the Turkish Stand Off Missile - Joint (SOM-J). The UAI program office is responsible for development and enhancement of the standard, support to coalition\/allied\/joint interoperability efforts for weapons-platform interface, provision of certification tools, and implementation support to aircraft and weapons."

During FY10, these contracts expired. Under the authority of the class J&A, Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)\ncontracts were awarded to the four UAI vendors in August 2010. Follow-on period of performance was awarded in March 2014 for 16 months to better align future contract awards with funding through the Future Years Defense Program. The period of performance was extended to 1 November 2015 to allow immediate start of the effort on F-35\/JSF request for changes. A new J&A was approved in January 2015 for the follow-on sole source contracts to the original equipment manufacturers. These new sole-source contracts were awarded in November 2015 and will expire in November 2019. A new J&A was signed in December 2018 and the RFP for a follow-on sole source 5 year contract was released in February 2019."

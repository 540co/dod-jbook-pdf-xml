UMCS develops the control station and integrates it with the MQ-25 AS along with multiple networks and systems both afloat and on shore.\n\nMQ-25 PU 3278 execution is dependent upon the success of UMCS PU 3279 execution. This submission for PU 3278 has been coordinated with UMCS PU 3279.\n\nThe prime contractor for MQ-25 development declared a loss on the MQ-25 contract in Oct 2018 and thereby invoked Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 32.503-6(g). Per the loss contract clause, a loss ratio factor must be applied to all progress payments to protect the government by ensuring the amount of unliquidated progress payments does not exceed the fair value of undelivered work. The reduced progress payments will prevent the program from meeting expenditure benchmarks in the near years.\n\nIn January 2016, PE 0605414N PU 3278 was established as the principal budget line for MQ-25. In January 2018, PU 3279 was established for the Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS)."

        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The MQ-25 program, PU 3278, rapidly develops an unmanned capability to embark on Carrier Vessel, Nuclear (CVN) as part of the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) to conduct aerial refueling as a primary mission and provide Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) capability for a secondary mission.  MQ-25 extends CVW mission effectiveness range, partially mitigates the current Carrier Strike Group (CSG) organic ISR shortfall and fills the future CVW-tanker gap, mitigating Strike Fighter shortfall and preserving F\/A-18E\/F Fatigue Life Expenditure for its primary missions. As the first carrier-based, group 5 Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), MQ-25 will pioneer the integration of manned and unmanned operations, utilize mature, complex sea-based Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) UAS technologies, and pave the way for future multifaceted multi-mission UAS to pace emerging threats.  \n\nThe MQ-25 system will enhance (CVN) capability and versatility for the Joint Forces Commander through the integration of a persistent, sea-based, multi-mission aerial refueling and reconnaissance UAS into the CVW. MQ-25 is comprised of an AS which will integrate with the UCA Mission Control System (UMCS) program.  These architectural segments will be managed by the PMA-268 Government Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) that provides system-of-systems integration and is also responsible for managing enterprise-level UCA architecture and associated interfaces. MQ-25 Development includes development and test of the air vehicle to include software, peculiar support equipment, training systems and other logistics elements.\n\nIn FY21, MQ-25 PU 3278 will continue to fund the Air System integration and interface development activities.  The Engineering Development Models (EDMs) will complete production in FY21 and enter developmental flight-testing.  The MQ-25 Government team will increase to meet testing and logistics readiness execution in FY21.  Software contractor testing and test readiness reviews will continue in preparation for first flight.  Final assembly of the third System Demonstration Test Article will complete.\n\nThe Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS) program, PU 3279, develops and integrates the MQ-25 control station, designated the MD-5, and auxiliary communications systems using ARC-210 and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capable radios as well as a situational awareness display called the Video Management System (VidMS).  UMCS also develops software for the MD-5 control station and integrates that software with MQ-25 unique software.  UMCS performs CVN infrastructure modifications by reconfiguring several spaces within the carrier in order to install the MD-5 control station, auxiliary communications systems, and VidMS in support of MQ-25 test events and operations aboard select NIMITZ Class carriers.  UMCS is also responsible for unique modifications to and integration with C4I systems that provide communications and network paths for Air Vehicle (AV) and mission payload (ISR data) connectivity.  UMCS accomplishes this by integrating the MD-5 control station, with the MQ-25 AS along with multiple networks and systems both afloat and on shore. \n\nIn FY21 UMCS will continue to fund the modification and installation of UMCS hardware and software on two CVNs needed for MQ-25 underway test periods. UMCS will continue product development and NRE activities for Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE), the Integrated Communication System (ICS), the MD-5 control station subsystems, the MUOS capable radios, and start testing.  UMCS will continue the development and integration of UMCS software components and deliver two baselined configurations to the MQ-25 contractor in support of MQ-25 first flight activities. UMCS will continue the development and integration activities with multiple NAVWAR C4I programs of record (e.g. CVN networks, Navy Tactical Wide Area Networks, CVN and shore exploitation systems (i.e. The Distributed Common Ground System Navy (DCGS-N) and Classic Reach)and Common Data Link systems).  \n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION because it includes projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production decision."

Additionally, other MISC rate adjustments (+$2.595M) has no impact to the MQ-25 efforts.\n\nPU 3279 (-$7.337) - (-$6.300M) reduced to account for the availability of prior year execution balances. Additionally, MISC rate adjustments of (-$1.037) has no impact to the UMCS efforts.  \n\nTechnical: PU 3279 - Due to the FY20 Congressional Directed Reductions, the UMCS program will cease installation plans on two CVNs reducing CVNs available and ready for MQ-25 test from four to two which adds additional risk to the program schedule and IOC.  \n\nSchedule: Based on the reduction of CVNs available for test going from four to two, there will be a likelihood of a 10 month slide to the MQ-25 IOC. \n\nSchedules have been updated to provided greater insight into established milestones by reflecting critical schedule elements that affect or are directly correlated to future schedule milestones, updated delivery of Air Vehicle (AV) 1-4, and added delivery of System Demonstration Test Articles (SDTA) based on Prime Contractor delivery schedule."

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2430(d)(1), the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) is ASN(RDA).\n\nMQ-25 requirements are aligned with the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Family of Systems (FoS) ICD, which highlight the need for carrier-based refueling and persistent ISR capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) endorsed the UCLASS ICD in April 2011 and formally approved it on 9 June 2011 via Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 087-11.  The NGAD FoS ICD was validated by the JROC on 18 August 2015 and formally approved by JROCM 087-15. The JROC's guidance delineated in the validated ICDs and subsequent JROCMs was to establish a requirement for a versatile platform that supports a myriad of organic Naval missions such as aerial refueling and ISR to support the CVW. The JROC validated the Capability Development Document for MQ-25 Carrier Based Unmanned Air System on 21 July 2017. After contract award in 2018, an opportunity to accelerate Initial Operational Capability (IOC) to 2024 was recognized, and the Navy decided to make the investments required to capture that opportunity by increasing the number of test carrier installs to four from two and funding System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) production to start in FY20. Due to the UMCS FY20 budget reduction (PU 3279), modifications will cease on two of the four carriers which could increase risk to reaching the 2024 IOC. The success of the FY24 IOC is based upon a stable funding base for both UMCS and MQ-25 execution in alignment with the schedules as defined in PU 3278 and PU 3279.\n\nMQ-25 is using an evolutionary acquisition strategy to develop, fly, deploy, and evolve an Initial Operational Capability system for fleet integration.  This MQ-25 acquisition strategy continues with entry into flight test, correction of deficiencies work and stand up of logistic\/training efforts in conjunction with continued CVN modifications required for IOTE and IOC in 2024.  \n\nMQ-25 awarded a fixed price incentive, firm target (FPIF) contract for the AS EMD contract to Boeing in August 2018.\n\nMQ-25 is dependent on the UMCS program to provide carrier-based control stations and integration into CVN networks."

                            "val": "The Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS) program builds, integrates, and installs control systems required to operate the MQ-25. The UMCS program includes what was previously identified as the Control System & Connectivity (CS&C) and Carrier Vessel, Nuclear (CVN) Segments previously captured under the MQ-25 Development PU 3278.\n\nUMCS builds the following hardware: MD-5 Control Station, the Video Management System (VidMS), the ARC-210 Radio Communication System (RCS), and the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capable radios. The control station has a ship and shore variant designated the MD-5A and MD-5B, respectively. The MD-5 consists of the following subsystems: Common Display System (CDS), Common Processing System (CPS), Network Processing Group (NPG), Integrated Communication System (ICS), and the Stingray Operating Software Suite (SOSS). MD-5A and B use the same common components with slight differences in the ICS, SOSS, and networking equipment. The VidMS provides MQ-25 air vehicle operators with the required video situational awareness of the unmanned carrier environment. The ARC-210 RCS provides narrow band Line of Sight (LOS) command and control (C2) transmissions with the MQ-25 while the MUOS capable radio provides narrow band Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) C2 transmissions with the MQ-25 using the MUOS satellite system.\n\nUMCS leads development, modification, engineering, and integration activities, facilitating seamless voice, data, and command and control exchanges with the MQ-25 air system, local networks, voice networks, C2 networks, tactical networks, intelligence systems, and launch and recovery systems.\n\nUMCS performs CVN infrastructure modifications and installs the hardware mentioned above in support of MQ-25 operations aboard select NIMITZ class carriers. All CVN installation and integration activities are planned and executed using the Ship Change Document (SCD) process.\n\nCVN installations are regulated by Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) processes\/guidelines that delineate strict schedules and deadlines for documentation, drawings, and hardware availability to support carrier modifications and by the CVN availability schedule (revised at least twice per year) which identifies pre-planned maintenance periods for all NIMITZ and FORD Class CVNs. Changes to the NAVSEA owned CVN availability schedule could, in turn, drive changes to the UMCS installation schedule.\n\nThe CVN modification and hardware installation process can be divided into four phases. Phase 1 is characterized by the development of technical data packages (TDPs), general and specific CVN hull number guidance documents, and the SCDs to be installed; this phase begins approximately three years, or more, before the start of the CVN maintenance period. Phase 2 is characterized by the performance of a hull specific Ship Check, development of the Ship Installation Drawings (SIDs) for a specific CVN installation, and the purchase of the MD-5 subsystems, the VidMS, and the LOS\/BLOS subsystems; this phase begins two years before the start of the CVN maintenance period. Phase 3 is characterized by the approval of the SIDs, development of installation schedules, completion of cybersecurity\/logistics documentation, and the integration and testing of the MD-5 and associated subsystems; this phase begins approximately one year prior to the start of the CVN maintenance period. Phase 4 is characterized by the modification of the CVN infrastructure, installation of the MD-5 and associated subsystems, and completion of the system operational verification testing (SOVT); ); tasking is scheduled based on the number of ship change documents (SCDs) being installed and the length of the planned CVN Maintenance Availability period.  When availability periods are only six months long, activities will begin at the start of the CVN maintenance period.  Due to the size and complexity of the UMCS modifications, a minimum of two 6-month maintenance periods is required for a full installation."

                            "val": "In January of 2018, PU 3279 was established for the Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS).\nIn February 2019, the UMCS program was designated ACATII and is a separate PoR from the MQ-25 Air System (AS) ACAT IB.  However, separate PoRs, UMCS and the MQ-25 AS are both required to field a Carrier Based Unmanned Air system (CBUAS) capability.  MQ-25 AS is dependent on UMCS to meet the programs 2024 IOC.\n   - Due to the close alignment of requirements with MQ-25 AS, interoperability, and parent documentation, the UMCS PoR will leverage MQ-25 PoR acquisition events and milestones as part of the acquisition strategy for oversight and approvals.\n   - The MQ-25 CBUAS Program was designated as a Maritime Accelerated Acquisition (MAA) Program by the CNO and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN(RDA)). This designation expedites the acquisition and fielding of the MQ-25 system and directs all associated organizations to support the MQ-25 Program on a priority basis.\n   - The UMCS government team is performing the role of the Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) for the ground control system.\n   - In order to expedite fielding of UMCS per MAA policy and to align with the IOC requirements for the MQ-25 SoS, the program team has and will continue to leverage systems with high Technology Readiness Levels, largely consisting of Commercial and Government Off the Shelf systems (i.e. COTS and GOTS) to the greatest extent possible. \n\nUMCS completed Milestone C 05 March 2019.  The UMCS acquisition strategy was approved in 25 July 2019.  The UMCS PoR will use an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop, integrate, test, deploy, and evolve the capabilities throughout the life of the system.  The UMCS requires integration of multiple products with the primary developmental system being the software dominant MD-5.  There will be no Full-Rate Production decision due to the limited number of CVNS and shore sites.\n\nUMCS hardware procurements will accommodate CVN installation, testing, and deployment constraints as well as ship modification schedule constraints. \n   - Because UMCS is integrated and installed aboard CVNs, PMA-268 must follow the ship modernization process, which directs delivery dates for deliverables and installation milestones associated with a CVN maintenance availability period. The lead-time associated with this process drives the timeline to design, develop, and procure equipment ahead of the planned installation date.\n\nUMCS testing will occur in multiple stages tied primarily to software version beginning with 2.0. Testing will progress from standalone testing with an AV simulator, to operating in conjunction with a hardware-in-the-loop air vehicle (hot bench) to shipboard evaluation of UAWC installations. Each version of UMCS will be evaluated for system functionality and usability through a series of capabilities based test events focusing on execution of the mission tanking, recovery tanking, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance missions. Additional testing to include mission planning, supportability, and reliability will be conducted during dedicated events when not captured concurrently with other test"

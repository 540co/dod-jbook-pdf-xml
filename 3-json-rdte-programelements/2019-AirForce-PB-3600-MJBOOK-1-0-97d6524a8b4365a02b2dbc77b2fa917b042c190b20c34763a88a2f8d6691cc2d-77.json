In accordance with Air Force Materiel Command mission assignment memo (dated 17 Feb 11) and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)-Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU dated 28 Jun 12), the USAF is responsible for development, acquisition and delivery of a guided TKA and All Up Round (AUR) technical integration, system qualification and fielding of the B61-12 variant on multiple platforms.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-61 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

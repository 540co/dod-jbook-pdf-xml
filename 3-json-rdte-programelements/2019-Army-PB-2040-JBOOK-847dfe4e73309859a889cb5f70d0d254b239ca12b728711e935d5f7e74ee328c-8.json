The synergy between these embedded training capabilities and the immersive training advanced technology development in Project S28 provides Army units with a set of complementary embedded as well as deploy-on-demand systems that provide just-in-time, dynamic, realistic training, and mission rehearsal capabilities.  Demonstrations include technologies that form a framework for future training applications for the range of future force operations such as robotic control and other sensor operations; mission planning and rehearsal; maneuver; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network analysis to support distributed simulations; and vehicle system interface requirements.  This project creates a joint environment by synchronizing virtual and constructive simulated forces with the next generation and current training systems from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps forces.   \n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The ASB dates to November 1951 when the Secretary of the Army, Honorable Frank Pace Jr., appointed twelve outstanding scientists and industrialists to a scientific advisory panel to assist him and the Army's leadership in creating an effective, economical, and progressive fighting force using existing technology and industrial resources. Three years later, this panel was expanded and officially designated the Army Scientific Advisory Panel (ASAP), with its first formal meeting held on November 16, 1954. In 1977, with the passage of FACA, the ASB was created to replace the ASAP.\n\nThe ASB provides the Army with a resource of world-class scientists, engineers, technologists and operational experts as well as business, policy and managerial specialists from the private sector, academia, non-DoD government agencies and former senior military officers. Its members volunteer their expertise and time to address those critical national security challenges for which the Army's leadership seeks independent and unbiased technical advice. The ASB focuses on issues of importance to large segments of the Army, and its products are delivered in a candid and timely manner.\n\nThe Board is composed of 20 voting and 20 non-voting members, each serving three-year terms, and consultants who serve one-year terms. Membership is carefully monitored to ensure that diverse disciplines and points of view are represented. The Secretary of the Army appoints the Chair and Vice Chair from the ASB membership. The ASB Chair also serves as a non-voting observer to the Defense Science Board. ASB membership is augmented by a small number of consultants who are appointed to provide specialized expertise for ASB studies."

The ASB Charter states that annual requirements will typically entail a personnel cost of seven Full-Time Equivalents.\n\nCurrently, the Secretary of the Army has approved four permanent subcommittees to the Board:\n\n1) The Army Science Board Basic Science and Disruptive Technologies Subcommittee is composed of not more than 15 members and addresses issues relating to the Army's basic research and disruptive technologies, including Soldier performance enhancement, cognition improvement, and training; autonomous systems and human-machine teaming; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high-yield Explosives (CBRNE); and counter Weapons of Mass Destruction.\n\n2) The Army Science Board Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Subcommittee is composed of not more than 15 members and addresses issues relating to the Army's C41SR core competency, including the tactical edge Command, Control, and Communications (C3), situational awareness overmatch, and electronic warfare.\n\n3) The Army Science Board Systems Engineering, Integration, and Sustainment Subcommittee is composed of not more than 15 members and addresses relating to the Army's core competency in systems engineering and integration; advanced prototyping and experimentation in operational environments; and sustainment, including engineered resilient systems, agile logistics and health management. These competencies are essential to the performance of the entire acquisition community.\n\n4) the Army Science Board Weapon Systems Subcommittee is composed of not more than 15 members and addresses issues relating to the Army's weapon systems core competency in: Rotorcraft Design Synthesis & Performance Assessment (DS&PA) and airworthiness\/safety; ground combat vehicle DS&PA, Soldier interaction, and system integration; lethality, including impact physics, energetics, warhead DS&PA, effects modeling and simulation; survivability and protection, including armor and balanced approach for detection\/hit\/kill avoidance; and air and missile defense DS&PA, precision fires, seekers, and precision guidance."

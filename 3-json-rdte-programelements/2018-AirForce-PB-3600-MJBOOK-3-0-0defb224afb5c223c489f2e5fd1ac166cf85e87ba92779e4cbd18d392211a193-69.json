            "val": "Funding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in PE 01051921F, Service Support to STRATCOM - Space Activities.\"\n\nThe Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions. An October 2014 memorandum of agreement between USSTRATCOM and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Defense Continuity and Mission Assurance transferred budget authority for SPACE SECTOR DCIP to USSTRATCOM to streamline the execution of funding. Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links. DCIP manages the identification, prioritization, assessment, and assurance of Defense Critical Infrastructure as a comprehensive program. The program includes the development of adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk.  \n\n\nNavigation Warfare (Navwar) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.   The JNWC develops and maintains the Department\u2019s premier collection of Navwar knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  Navwar expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating US and Coalition Navwar capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied \/ degraded PNT environments.  JNWC provides Department wide PNT posture through the PNT Annual assessment.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on two Joint Mission Essential Tasks:\n\n1.  Provide Operational Navwar Support \u2013 Enable Navwar operations and provide planning subject matter expertise to Combatant Commands, Services, interagency partners and the coalition; Advocate DoD-wide Navwar activities to fully integrate Navwar into military operations and the future force structure.\n\n2.  Create and Maintain Navwar Knowledge Operationalize PNT Superiority \u2013 Conduct PNT operational field assessments, studies and analyses, analyze and disseminate Navwar R intelligence, and maintain a Navwar armory\n\n\nThe Space Analysis and Application Development program integrates space based effects into Department\u2019s \u2018Model of Record\u2019 for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) campaign level M&S tool.  Enhanced space M&S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations. \n\nUSSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace.  These data isolation challenges result from  network isolation, incomplete communications architectures, data security, incompatible information formats, security release policy, etc., inhibiting effective and efficient consolidation of decision quality strategic, operational and tactical information.  The DIFC develops machine to machine solutions capable of ingesting Title 10 data at multiple classification levels, to include Special Access Program data, and associating\/correlating with National Technical Means at multiple classification levels to both enhance and amplify the Common Operational Picture. The DIFC works closely with DoD SAPCO and elements of the Director of National Intelligence, to include NSA, NRO and CIA, to both identify and address policy barriers, architectures and training opportunities necessary to enable seamless flow of data from all available sensors to warfighters during time of conflict, primarily leveraging currently fielded tactical data links.  Though some recommended solutions validated during demonstration events may not transition to operations immediately, but nevertheless provide validated architecture solutions and approved security policies for use should conflict arise versus ad hoc attempts to solve data movement issues during conflict."

JNWC conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating US and Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied \/ degraded PNT environments.

Enhanced space M&S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions.  \n\nThe DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations. \n\nUSSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace. Funds are necessary to update current government-owned software to ingest and disseminate new data sources from Title 10 and Title 50 sensors.

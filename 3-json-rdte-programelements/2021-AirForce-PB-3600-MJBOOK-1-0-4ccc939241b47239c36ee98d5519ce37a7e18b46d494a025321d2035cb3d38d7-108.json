Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.   These restoration\/modernization funds support the following Air Force test organizations and their associated test and evaluation facilities, including:  remote locations, the 96th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, including AEDC's 704th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, 704 TG Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, AEDC's Hypersonic Wind Tunnel 9 at White Oak, MD, AEDC's National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, CA, AEDC's McKinley Climatic Lab (MCL) at Eglin AFB, FL, and the 412th TW at Edwards AFB, CA.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

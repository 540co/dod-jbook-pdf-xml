These support investigation of physical and chemical properties and interactions for enhanced functionalities important to detection, diagnostics, protection, and decontamination.\n\nBA1 also supports the DoD Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Strategy Plan to attract, inspire, and develop exceptional STEM talent across the education continuum to enrich our current and future DoD workforce to meet defense technological challenges.  This includes the Joint Science and Technology Institute (JSTI) which is a 2-week residential program for high school students and teachers who conduct a research project from a STEM field with a DoD scientist.  In addition, the National Research Council Research Associateship Program and the Military Internship Program provide unique opportunities for talented scientists and engineers, and promising midshipmen\/cadets, to conduct research at DoD service laboratories on projects that are of interest to the Chemical and Biological Defense Program Enterprise in an effort to develop the future DoD workforce.\n\nThe projects in this PE are placed in BA1 because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities."

Complete, test, and validate primers and probes for filovirus animal model and develop in vitro and in vivo inflammatory response models. Continue to develop robust genetic control architectures for guidance of antimicrobials against bio threats. Evaluate gut-on-a-chip devices for diagnostic capability and build capacity for multiple pathogens. Validate nano-structured material drug delivery in various tissues and measure bio-distribution for optimal therapeutic delivery. Conduct in vivo validation against agent challenge to demonstrate proof of concept. Continue evaluation of role of gene amplification and duplication in the development of multiple drug resistance in bacterial pathogens. Replicate environmental factors of persistence and validate mechanism against animal models. Continue to investigate the influence of glycosylation patterns on biologic stability and begin pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity studies to validate animal model efficacy. Continue to investigate filovirus glycoprotein tertiary structure and other viral immunodominant epitopes for improved development of immune assays which will support identification of an immune correlate of protection for vaccine licensure. Begin validation of in silico transport mechanisms of the blood-brain barrier studies, in vitro, and in vivo to screen for potential therapeutic targets. Evaluate gene duplication and amplification as a specific mechanism for antimicrobial resistance and horizontal gene transfer. Begin development of a gene amplification detection system that can identify changes in antimicrobial and multidrug resistance. Investigate novel inhibitory mechanisms that circumvent efflux pumps. Explore the application of microfluidics to examine the host-immune response in the microenvironment and biomarker discover for infection onset and response to therapy. Examine the impact of modulated olfactory, respiratory, and alveolar molecular & cell population variation on uptake of inhaled particulates, progression of toxicological & pathogenic effects."

Research results in physics, chemistry, and materials sciences that have potential application in point and standoff detection, diagnostics, as well as protection and decontamination.  Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nano-mechanical resonance sensing, and nano-meter imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics."

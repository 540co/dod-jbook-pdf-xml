            "val": "The Army Concepts Experimentation Program supports current and future concepts and capabilities involving Soldiers and Leaders within live, virtual, and constructive environments by exploring concepts, capability requirements and solutions across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) domains. The purpose of Concepts Experimentation is to clarify and mitigate risk for current and future forces. Experiments and projects inform Army futures concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent user requirements in the future Army. Army experiments use the combined resources of Army Battle Laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinement, and assessment of future force concepts. Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) will integrate and assess Army Concepts and Force Design phases with Army-level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) enhances Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development in support of Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions. This PE provides for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs, enabling development and deployment\/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force. Early Synthetic Prototyping enables a wargaming and experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions. This PE provides funding for Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA) that physically integrate, assess and evaluate networked capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. This PE also provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration.\n\nThe Soldier-Centered Analysis For Future Force Project (33B) will provide early application of human performance and human figure modeling tools in the development of Soldier-focused requirements to shape technology for Future Force development. These efforts include design analyses, constructive simulations, and Soldier-in-the loop assessments to ensure that manpower requirements and workload and skill demands are considered, avoiding information and physical task overloads and taking optimum advantage of aptitudes, individual and collective training, and numbers of Soldiers for an affordable Future Force."

In support of the Army Vision and Army Strategy, experimentation focuses on the latest Multi-Domain Operations Concept and operational and organizational concepts for the Army of 2028 and beyond.

Established a continuing collaboration, feedback, and electronic analytical collection capability which captured, through simulated application of future force prototype concepts, explicit qualitative feedback of Soldiers experience gathered from simulated environments intertwined with surveys, polls, and discussion boards. Directed SIMEXs leverage unique support analytics which capture Soldier and Team interactions during virtual small unit, first-person operating environment events, from shooter engagements to high-tempo teaming events. These experiments integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs, and Capabilities to support Force 2025 and Beyond Maneuvers. The goal is to develop, refine, and validate prerequisite Force 2025 and Beyond Concepts, Operational and Organization Plans, and DOTMLPF solutions to achieve a consistent, adaptable vision of the Army's Force in the near, mid, and far terms. \n\nExperiments empowered participants to explore innovative techniques and participate in equipment and material design options which enabled the Maneuver Battle Lab to be innovative in partnering with Department of Defense (DoD) Research and Development organizations in the development of solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges that would be assessed through further iterations of Army Experimentation. In FY18 this effort leveraged design of a high echelon, strategic environment which examines how units organize and employ future capabilities on the battlefield. The Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) continues, through a distributive network capability to support the Army Level Acquisition Design and merge with the Experimentation Mission while leveraging and sharing the expense of the Battle Labs to interject a new dynamic interactive process into proponent missions. As Soldiers explored new ideas, concepts, material, and doctrine, they employed new techniques in coordination with the development of requirements documents, providing improved insight into requirements design during the conceptual development stage rather than post-construction."

These resource requirements provide AFC and FCC resources to execute as lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) and central coordination for Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA). These requirements support critical research, development, test and evaluation for Early Synthetic Prototyping and enable war-gaming and experimentation that engages soldiers across the Army to gain insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions. FCC integrates accelerated capabilities development activities between Army proponent force modernization managers as well as Joint \/ Sister Service coordination. AFC\/FCC conducts Joint Warfighter Assessments to physically integrate, assess and evaluate adaptive capability sets to accelerate the systems acquisition process that provides DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army."

In order to enable early assessment of future combat vehicle interior crew station designs, this effort performed verification and validation of proposed crew station designs using a fixed-heel point accommodation model. To construct vehicle models compatible with human figure modeling analysis in support of the Route Clearance Interrogation System (RCIS) program, this effort developed a rapid modeling technique incorporating portable handheld laser scanning technology and point cloud reduction software. For improved assessment of future aviation and ground platforms, this effort developed a human figure modeling methodology for determining seat placement of encumbered manikin sets. Finally, this effort also improved the accuracy of threat prediction algorithms to support command mission planning and course of action analyses and developed apps to support anthropometric data collection and analysis."

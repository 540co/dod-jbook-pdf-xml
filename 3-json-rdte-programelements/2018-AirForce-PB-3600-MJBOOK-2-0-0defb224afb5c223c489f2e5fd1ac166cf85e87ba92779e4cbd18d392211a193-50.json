            "val": "United States Air Force (USAF) Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Program Element (PE) is broken into two thrust areas:  Modeling and Simulation Foundations, and Warfighter Readiness.  It directly supports USAF, Joint and Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing through modeling and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2).  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging USAF capabilities within DoD and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating capabilities within USAF LVC environments.  \n\nLVC environments today are used as the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative, USAF M&S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of USAF and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed, they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  These, in turn, enable joint, coalition, and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 100,000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g., Ulchi Freedom Guardian, Red & Blue Flags, Unified Endeavor, etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators, which replicate high demand\/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1,000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. \n\nUSAF M&S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland. This generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption, aircraft wear and tear, and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes, the USAF M&S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models, simulations, tools, and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&S capabilities across the lifecycle, reduce developmental costs, and minimize risks. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available, tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  \n\nIt includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands.  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  \n\nThe Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  It includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combat Commanders battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS)."

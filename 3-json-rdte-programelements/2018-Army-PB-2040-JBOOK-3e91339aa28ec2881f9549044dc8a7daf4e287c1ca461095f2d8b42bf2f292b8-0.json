This is accomplished by participating in and providing support to Unified Quest wargames and experiments to analyze and integrate technology to identify the feasibility integration into Army space, missile defense, and high altitude systems. The Space and Missile Defense Command will participate and support biennial rewrites of Army Capstone, Operational and Functional Concepts. Continue to provide operational manager support to STRATCOM, NORTHCOM and SOCOM Joint Technical Capability Demonstrations to ensure Army space, missile defense, and high altitude equities are represented in advanced technology developments by demonstrating military utility when applied to military equipment and techniques. Examples include: supporting multi service experiments and capability development of the national-directed Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as it is applied to each of the regional COCOMs; and experimenting with operationally responsive space, space control, and high altitude capabilities to ensure the broader Army enterprises can leverage the advantages of these platforms for communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), position navigation, missile warning and command and control. Continue to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments. Developing effective Integrated Missile Defense concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM.

This will be accomplished by supporting ongoing efforts that provide the most realistic operating environment available to perform technology gap and cost reduction analysis of space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  Realistic operating environments will be available to determine the ability of the specific technologies to fill capability gaps in terms of utility to the warfighter.  Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools\/Test Beds for evolving space superiority and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance space, missile defense and high altitude systems. The Future War Center (FWC) will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) delivering the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis, operational planning, and exercise\/ experimentation support.  The FWC will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Reconfigurable Tactical Operations Simulator (RTOS) delivering operator in the loop capability for air and missile defense simulation in distributed exercises and experiments.  Worked closely with the document integrators (DI) at United States Army Force Management Support Agency (USAFMSA) to document the 100th and 49th GMD Brigade and Battalion TOEs to ensure the accuracy of the documentation of the associated Force Design Updates. The DI to review the TOEs that were developed and captured the personnel and equipment changes as directed by the approved FDU's.  This FDU confirmed the requirement for a non-standardized motor maintenance section, created additional operations officers within the GMD Brigade, and created a GMD master gunner\/operations NCO to provide oversight of GMD qualification\/certification within the Brigade S3.  Equipment shortfalls and gaps that were identified were validated as new requirements.  An ambulance was added to medical section to provide an organic medevac capability and the maintenance section received a much needed capability to self-recover their own vehicles and transport them to maintenance facilities over 350 miles away.  Proper documentation of the TOE will allow this homeland defense unit to maintain their supremacy over the threat forces they keep at bay.  By closely working with USAFMSA during the development of the TOEs, this ensured that the TOEs documented the results of the FDU accurately.    Proper documentation of the FDUs ensures the 100th MD BDE and 49th MD BN will execute their mission of preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction, reduce hazards to friendly forces, and civilian populations. Secured the approval of both FDU Jr's for the 100th and 49th Missile Defense Brigade and Battalion at HQDA. With the lapse in HQDA organizational integrators (OI), these FDU Jr's were in hold status until a replacement OI was assigned.  This caused a potential risk that the force structure changes would not be approved and have to be applied outside the original FY.  Within weeks of the new OI being assigned, I briefed the OI on the FDU Jrs, the reason for the FDU Jr's and capability gaps the FDUs were correcting, both personnel and equipment shortfalls.  This interaction with the OI allowed him to present these two FDU Jr's in an expeditious manner to the Army Staff at the 1-Star level.  The FDU Jr's were approved by HQDA, and in time to have the TOE and MTOEs created that met the original time lines required to affect these changes in FY 17, thus saving pending force structure reductions from occurring.  The changes to force structure and equipment capability gaps were resolved. Proper documentation of the FDUs ensures the 100th MD BDE and 49th MD BN will execute their mission of preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction, reduce hazards to friendly forces, and civilian populations."

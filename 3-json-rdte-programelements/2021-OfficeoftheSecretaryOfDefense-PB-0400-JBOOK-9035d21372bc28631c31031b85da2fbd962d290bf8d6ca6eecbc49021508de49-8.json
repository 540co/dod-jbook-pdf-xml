The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives. The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management.\n\nSoftware is critical to meeting the Department of Defense's (DoD) increasing demand for national defense systems that are high-quality, affordable, and deployed in a timely way. With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership in all aspects of software-based system development, operation, defense, and evolution to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research program element (PE) develops and evaluates the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts, with the potential to improve future DoD systems.  The research conducted by this PE directly benefits the technical domains Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber, and Engineered Resilient Systems."

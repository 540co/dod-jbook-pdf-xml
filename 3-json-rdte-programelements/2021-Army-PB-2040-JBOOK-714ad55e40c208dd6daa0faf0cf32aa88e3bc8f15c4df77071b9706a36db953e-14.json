            "val": "This program element funds the development of constructive and wargame simulations used to realistically train commanders and their battle staffs on today's complex battlefield conditions. \n\nProject 361 funds the development of the Intelligence Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT). IEWTPT is a Non-System Training Device (NSTD) which supports home station training by simulating and stimulating Military Intelligence (MI) organic or surrogate equipment. It enables sustainment of critical individual and collective MI tasks\/skills and is the core of the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE) Military Intelligence (MI) holistic training strategy supporting mission command, targeting, and MI soldier readiness. IEWTPT provides a realistic simulation intelligence target environment for Multi-Intelligence disciplines such as All Source Analysis, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and must stimulate and emulate multiple Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platform systems such as: Prophet, Distributed Common Ground Station-Army (DCGS-A); Tactical Ground Station (TGS); and Aerial Intelligence assets such as Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) and Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS). IEWTPT provides training capabilities supporting detailed ISR individual, crew, and collective level mission rehearsals\/exercises. IEWTPT can utilize a constructive simulation feed or operate in a stand-alone mode. IEWTPT provides the \"Digital Range\" for Warfighting Commanders at all echelons to train intelligence tasks based on accurately portraying the operational environment and simulating and stimulating MI equipment where system operators and analysts are able to synchronize their Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets to exploit exercise intelligence data and provide the commander with required, executable, intelligence information in support of decision making. IEWTPT provides training for analyst and system operators to exploit intelligence data during training, just as they would in \"Real World\" operations. The IEWTPT Technical Control Cell (TCC) is composed of two components: The Lower Enclave (LE) which supports exercise planning and development and drives the All Source and GEOINT training tasks and the Upper Enclave (UE) which supports all SIGINT related training and operates at the Top Secret \/ Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) classification level.\n\nFY 2021 funding in the amount of $2.024 million supports MI soldier readiness and mission command by developing interface capabilities with Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platform programs\/systems of record to train detailed military intelligence mission essential tasks in a simulation environment. The funds provide the development of web-enabled, cloud ready capabilities and emerging Electronic Warfare (EW) and intelligence support to Cyber operations for inclusion into the Technical Control Cell (TCC) software baseline. Additionally, funding will provide for transition to IEWTPT Increment 2 in FY 2022 by leveraging the existing mature program baseline. Increment 2 will be a software only environment and will provide training capabilities that are synchronized with emerging Intelligence Corps system modernization priorities supporting multi-domain operations.     \n\nProject 362, Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) supports Army Title X training worldwide for Army Commanders and their staff at Mission Training Complexes (MTCs), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) facilities, and other customer locations. JLCCTC trains Commanders and their staff in Decisive Actions to include offensive, defensive, stability, civil support operations, and is in the process to satisfy Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) requirements moving forward.  JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to Army Training Mission Area by providing appropriate levels of model and simulation resolution and fidelity to support unit collective and combined arms training. The JLCCTC provides a composable federation configurable to any combination of models and simulations, as required by training exercise intent\/design. The JLCCTC provides accurate representations of tactically and operationally relevant land warfare operations executed in a contemporary Joint operating environment\/context in support of Army Training and Readiness.\n\nFY 2021 base funding in the amount of $8.134 million will complete Version 9.0 and will commence development, integration and test, and verification and validation activities for JLCCTC Version 10.0 to train Commanders and their Staff.  JLCCTC will continue to support emerging Common Operating Environment \/ Computing Environment (COE\/CE), Mission Command (MC), Cyber Security\/Risk Management Framework (RMF), and Concurrency warfighter requirements.  In addition, JLCCTC will continue to support the integration activities with Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA), Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS), IEWTPT, and conduct Army ground model Analysis of Alternative (AoA) to interface with the Joint simulation capability."

The contract continues the incremental development, integration, test and evaluation, production and fielding and exercise\/technical\/training support for the US Army Military Intelligence Corps.  The FY 2020 funds will provide continued version 10.0 development, testing, production, and integration of the IEWTPT system and software version releases and will set the conditions for Increment 2 in FY 2022 and intelligence modernization lines of effort. FY2021 funding will provide for continued Increment 2 transition planning and a full and open competitive re-procurement of the IEWTPT contract. An eight year IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity) contract is planned for IEWTPT Increment 2 beginning 4th QTR FY 2021. This competitive procurement will ensure future training capabilities are nested with the Intelligence Corps modernization priorities for multifunctional intelligence support to maneuver commanders."

JLCCTC trains Commanders and their staff in Decisive Actions to include offensive, defensive, stability, and civil support operations. JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to Army Training Mission Area by providing appropriate levels of modeling and simulation resolution and fidelity to support unit collective and combined arms training.  JLCCTC provides a composable federation configurable to any combination of models and simulations, as required by training exercise intent\/design. JLCCTC provides accurate representations of tactically and operationally relevant land warfare operations executed in a contemporary Joint operating environment\/context and in support of Army Training and Readiness.\n\nFY 2021 base funding in the amount of $8.126 million will complete Version 9.0 and will commence development, integration and test, and verification and validation activities for JLCCTC Version 10.0 to train Commanders and their Staff.  JLCCTC will continue to support emerging Common Operating Environment \/ Computing Environment (COE\/CE), Mission Command (MC), Cyber Security\/Risk Management Framework (RMF), and Concurrency warfighter requirements.  In addition, JLCCTC will continue to support the integration activities with Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA), Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS), IEWTPT, and conduct Army ground model Analysis of Alternative (AoA) to interface with the Joint simulation capability."

This is necessary to ensure that space, high altitude and cyber capability gaps are identified and capabilities are correctly represented so that the Army's use of these capabilities is explored and where possible, exploited.  Will develop and maintain One Semi-Automated Force (OneSAF) simulation space updates and provide to PEO STRI to be included in OneSAF baseline.

USASMDC\/ARSTRAT will continue efforts to enhance the resiliency and effectiveness of critical space-based assets and JCIDS capability development activities for space superiority, high altitude persistent platforms, nano-satellites and tactical launch systems. Products scheduled to be delivered in FY17 include Army Cyberspace Analysis; Space Superiority Analysis of Alternatives and Cost -Benefit Analysis updates: Overhead Persistence Infrared (OPIR) Analysis; Assessment of Hostile use of Space Force Enhancement; and Position Navigation Timing (PNT) analysis.  TAA 20-24 (APR 2016-MAR 2017) will introduce new space capabilities into the force.  In order to bring those capabilities into the force development of new force design updates (FDUs) for FDU cycles 16-1, 16-2, 17-1 will be required.  Additionally during the TAA cycle new Rules of Allocation (ROA) will be developed to ensure SRC40 units are properly accounted for in the future POM force."

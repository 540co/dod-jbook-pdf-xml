This PE is managed by PMS 320, the Electric Ships Office, located organizationally within PEO SHIPS, responsible for developing Naval Power and Energy Systems that focus power system integration of Directed Energy (DE) and other high powered mission systems as well as platform integration and improving energy efficiency of those components and systems.  The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable and more capable electric power systems for all Navy platforms, focus Navy and industry investments, and reduce total ownership cost.  PEO Ships AM manages the SABER effort, responsible for protecting HM&E systems from cyber-attacks.\n\nThis PE serves as the bridge between Science and Technology (S&T) and ship platform and mission systems acquisition programs by identifying prospective applications for S&T research, advanced development, and performing additional product development and qualification when necessary to meet platform or mission system requirements.  This PE also includes the HM&E cybersecurity SABER development.  The HM&E systems to be protected from cyber-attack by SABER include Machinery Control Systems, steering control systems, Electric Power Systems, Damage Control and Firefighting, Auxiliary Machinery and Fluid Systems, Engines and Power Transmission Systems,  Gas Turbine Systems, Video Systems, as well as other HM&E systems.  SABER will allow the ship to better protect, detect, respond, and recover itself from a cyber-attack."

This project supports optimized integration of Directed Energy (DE) and other high powered mission systems, appropriate component and system controls, integration of components and systems into future and current ships, and providing power and energy system solution alternatives to new and existing platforms. Existing ships' power systems require optimized integration via energy storage and advanced controls techniques to withstand the effects of DE and other high powered mission systems and avoid negative impacts to power generating equipment (diesel\/gas turbine engines and generators).  \n\nProject developments are aligned with the Navy's 30 year shipbuilding plan via the Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap (TDR), which outlines the way ahead for future developments and provides a basis for coordinated planning and investment by the Navy and private industry. \n\nThis project develops and transitions products that electrically integrate and provide power to mission systems, integrates those components and systems into ship platforms, increases energy efficiency, and provides cybersecurity capabilities for current in-service Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) systems as well as future systems. \n\nThe systems developed by this Project are the power and energy foundation of the ships kill chain, and are developed with efficiency requirements as part of total life cycle cost minimization.  Efforts within Power and Energy Systems are to design, develop, test and integrate shipboard power systems to incorporate advanced sensors, directed energy and other advanced weapons. Design and testing includes modeling and simulation, as well as land based testing, to reduce risk and demonstrate readiness for shipboard use.   \n\nCybersecurity: Situational Awareness, Boundary Enforcement & Response (SABER) is a joint effort between PEO Ships, NAVSEA 21, PEO Carriers, NAVSEA 05Q (Afloat Cybersecurity Engineering Division), and supported by NSWC Philadelphia Division, to protect shipboard Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&E) systems from cyber-attacks.  SABER will use different sensors to monitor the HM&E network and system communications to detect potential attacks.  These sensors will feed information back to the central SABER Rack where Cyber Situational Awareness (SA) software will analyze the communications and produce alerts on any anomalies.  SABER will also include Boundary Defense capabilities at points where communications come into the HM&E enclave from other enclaves or functional domains (e.g., Navigation, Combat, C4I, Aviation)."

The AG9160RF Gas Turbine Generator (GTG) is an upgrade to the DDG1000 auxiliary gas turbine and will provide increased power to meet DDG51 Flight III requirements for advanced sensors and future weapons with reduction in life cycle costs through increased fuel efficiency over legacy gas turbine generator sets.\n\nDelivered two (2) Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) Power Conversion Modules (PCM) Low Rate Initial Power (LRIP) units to DDG51 Flight III land based test site, Philadelphia, PA. Continued to provide support for AMDR PCM units during PCM \/ AMDR combat system integration testing and electrical system validation testing at the DDG 51 Flight III test sites. AMDR PCM provides power conversion from ship's 4160 Volts Alternating Current (VAC) distribution systems to 1000 Volts Direct Current (VDC) to support the AMDR on DDG 51 Flight III Class Ships.\n\nIn order to obtain early insight into the effects of high power and energy mission systems on ships electric power systems, evaluate shipboard power and energy systems, and evaluate power system performance at lower cost than full-scale hardware system testing, simulated electrical system integration testing using power and energy system components will be conducted at the Center for Advanced Power System at Florida State University (FSU CAPS). This low-cost approach to testing is referred to as Power Hardware In the Loop (PHIL). PHIL includes development of component computer models that simulate and emulate actual operating machinery components and shipboard power and energy systems. PHIL testing replaces component models with hardware once hardware development is complete. PHIL testing costs less than full scale hardware system testing, shortens development time, and affords the opportunity to identify and mitigate risks in a deliberate fashion from specification development to computer model development to hardware development resulting in a more affordable and robust end product.  In FY 2018, five (5) PHIL demonstrations were completed.  PHIL demonstrations to date have replaced component computer models with the United Kingdom's Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS), the ESM prototype unit developed by this PE, and Advanced Circuit Protection Devices developed by Office of Naval Research (ONR). (Note: The results of the FESS and Energy Storage Module (ESM) prototype PHIL demonstrations were exchanged with the United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of Defence (MOD) via the Advanced Electrical Power and Propulsion Project (AEP3) Project Arrangement and the OSD Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) Directed Energy Power Systems (DEPS) project.)\n\nPHIL testing of the ESM prototype demonstrated Energy Magazine (EM) which serves as the energy resource to enable the introduction of pulsed high power and energy weapons and sensor systems by providing a buffered interface between legacy power systems and new generation weapons and sensors. Conducted PHIL testing of emulated high powered weapons and sensors into ships electrical systems at FSU CAPS.

IPES adds distributed EM functionality and advanced cyber safe controls to an integrated power system for enhanced survivability, efficient sharing of power and energy resources between ship propulsion, mission systems and ship service loads.\n\nConducted a design review and verified suitability of the ESM prototype for use in Stable Backup Power (SBP) applications.  Evaluated ESM prototype for use in providing shipboard energy storage to reduce individual component Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems.\n\nContinued to refine real time simulation models of various ship classes to reflect learning and state of ongoing development of power and energy system components and pulsed, high power and energy weapons and sensor systems (i.e. Directed Energy Weapons, e.g. laser). \n\nCompleted planning for FY 2019 simulated electrical system integration testing using real time power hardware in the loop.

Three SABER sensors were designed and completed both Preliminary & Critical Design Reviews (PDR\/CDR): two variants of the WeaselBoard (for DDG-51 class Engine Controller and generator Full Authority Digital Controller), and a Cyber Copper-wire Tap, with initial LRIP of 10-30 units.  Full-up SABER system architectures were complete for the DDG-51 class and CG-47 class in preparation for first installations in Q4 FY 2020.  RFIs were issued for both the SABER Computing Hardware contract and for the SABER Taps & Aggregators contract.  The RFP for SABER Computing Hardware was released.  Development of the Situational Awareness (SA) and Boundary Defense (BD) software tools and the High Availability ENvironment (HAVEN) continued throughout the year, with a couple build events with lab testing completed.  The final results of the initial Manpower & Training Analysis will be published.  The intent of SABER is to allow the ship to better protect, detect, respond, and recover from potential cyber-attacks on the HM&E enclave."

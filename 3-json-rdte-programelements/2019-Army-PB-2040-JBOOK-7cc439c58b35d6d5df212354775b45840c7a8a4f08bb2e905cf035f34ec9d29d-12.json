AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisition; and the design, development, fielding, and sustainment of Army weapon\/materiel systems. As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies system level performance data used in Army studies, and develops item-level performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&S).  \n\nAMSAA exercises Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) responsibility for developing, maintaining, improving, verifying, validating, and accrediting item-level performance data and M&S for combat effects and logistics. This includes the development and maintenance of common data formats.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems. Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, personnel and vehicle survivability, mobility, and system reliability. AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies. AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as: Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost\/performance trade-offs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons\/systems mix analyses; business case analyses; cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation. These analyses are used by leadership within HQDA (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); Army Materiel Command; Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers\/Project Managers; and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)\/Department of Defense (DoD). AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier, along with enhancing and sustaining readiness for the Current and Future Force. \n\nAMSAA's M&S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment. AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements. This M&S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems\/technologies for the readiness of the Current and Future Force.  \n\nAMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development.

AMSAA will also provide software analysis capability to support test and evaluation (T&E).  AMSAA will conduct follow-on studies for major Army programs undergoing engineering change proposals and continue to provide essential certified weapons system performance data for all major Army studies.  AMSAAs technical work program relating to Analyses of Alternative (AoA) (both providing analytic input and certified data as well as leading specified AoAs), Business Case Analyses, Cost Benefit Analyses and Risk Assessments will continue at a high level (similar to FY15 and FY16).  AMSAA is anticipating an increase in analytical support to Army ACAT 3, and ACAT 4 systems due to budget restrictions and financial limitations.  AMSAA will continue efforts in support of the Army Center for Reliability Growth (CRG), the Center for Army Acquisition and Materiel Lessons Learned (CAAMLL) as well as efforts on current operations related tasks, analyses, and model enhancements, specifically those supporting system performance data development, and materiel system performance analysis.  AMSAA will continue to enhance its comprehensive set of essential verified and validated item\/system level methodologies, tools, and models and simulations to insure accurate and up-to-date analytical products across the full spectrum of Army capability\/commodity areas. Additional funding to support:  1) Cyberspace Operations (CO), Cybersecurity, and Cyber Electromagnetic Activities Modeling, Simulation and Analyses (MS&A); and 2) Software Analysis Capability to Support Test and Evaluation (T&E)."

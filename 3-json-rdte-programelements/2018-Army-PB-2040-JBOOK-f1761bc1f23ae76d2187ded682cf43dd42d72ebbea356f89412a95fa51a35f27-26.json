The IOT&E tested the JBC-P system software on existing FBCB2 hardware (non-dismountable vehicle systems) and future production-representative hardware. On completion of Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Interoperability Test Certification (JITC), MDA authorized Full Rate Production (FRP) in 1QFY2014. First unit equipped (FUE) was successfully conducted 3QFY15.\n\nAs encouraged by DoD policy, developmental efforts are being performed through intra-government collaboration.  System engineering efforts are being performed by CERDEC's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD); Command, Power and Integration (CP&I) & the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD). Hardware along with fielding, training and field support efforts are obtained through existing competitively awarded contracts."

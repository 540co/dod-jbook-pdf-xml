Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances force protection technologies across the range of military operations, including expedient protection and hardened construction to defeat complex threats. This Project also designs and develops software and hardware to identify and mitigate ground obstacles for manned and unmanned vehicles; characterizes austere navigation environments, including complex urban environments, and designs and develops materiel solutions, including rapidly emplaced bridging and expedient repair technologies, to allow austere port and airfield entry of forces; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with protective construction and critical infrastructure. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; creates tools (including advanced models and simulations) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions; and supports research to assess non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants, such as bacteria and molds, in air handling equipment and building materials.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy..\n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology).\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, and homeland security. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the capability of autonomous engineering during combat operations to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk\/threat and dynamic environments, enables installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and on-demand expeditionary structures, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in contingency operations, including urban environments.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi."

Research efforts model the dynamics of electromagnetic, acoustic, and seismic propagation in response to changing terrain state and complex terrain features and geometry, and their depiction in geospatial information and mission command systems. Numerical modeling of weather effects on terrain properties supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command-delivered solutions to the Soldier. The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi."

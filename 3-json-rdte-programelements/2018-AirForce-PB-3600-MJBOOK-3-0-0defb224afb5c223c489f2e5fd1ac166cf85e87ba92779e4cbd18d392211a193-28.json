Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly transition advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs).  It provides for modeling\/simulation, training and systems engineering.  This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).\n\nFunds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.\n\nThe funds in this project are distributed in priority order, as supported by the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and set by the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Capabilities Working Group, for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the Airborne Sensors for ISR Analysis of Alternatives as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning."

                            "val": "The Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is a center of technical excellence to support Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) programs within the services.  The mission includes Service-specific and Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs throughout DoD. The JTC\/SIL provides a Government testbed for interoperability, rapid prototyping, technology insertion and transition, systems engineering, modeling\/simulation, training and C4ISR optimization. The cornerstone of JTC\/SIL's diverse tool set is the Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE), which is the DoD simulation\/training system of choice for many UAS, RPA and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance systems. The MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force application.  The MUSE\/AFSERS simulates Air Vehicles, Sensors, Datalinks, Takeoff and Landing Systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS and RPA ground stations, when actual ground stations are unavailable. \n\nThe Services and combatant commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures refinement, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the combatant commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.\n\nThe MUSE\/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.\n\nMUSE\/AFSERS is currently in use within all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M\/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the JTC\/SIL integrates imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of critical imagery processes. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC\/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. Distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture. The MUSE\/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.\n\nThe JTC\/SIL supports the Office of the Secretary of Defense UAS Task Force staff and the Standards and Interoperability Integrated Product Team, as well as the joint team working the Ground Segment Interface. The JTC\/SIL is the primary custodian of this interface and in that role performs various supporting tasks including development of tools for helping the definition and execution of open architecture for joint service ground control systems, developing and maintaining Standardization Agreement 45 joint interoperability tasks to be defined on an annual basis.  \n\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution."

These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.\nThe funds in this project are distributed in priority order for the goal of building a comprehensive Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and on the results of the Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) Analysis of Alternatives as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of\npromising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. The program office has the ability to initiate an I&TS project, within the GEOINT Capabilities Working Group (GCWG) construct but outside the normal annual GCWG vetting process, to expedite development and acquisition of urgently needed capabilities for the warfighter. Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS)2B efforts\ninclude but are not limited to development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.\n\nTraditional focus areas include, but are not limited to: development, demonstration, and rapid transition of common radar and electro-optical sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Low Frequency SAR, and antenna, Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), HSI, Low Light, Laser Radar (LADAR), Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) and their operational modes (High Resolution Imagery, Ground and Dismount Moving Target Indication (GMTI\/DMTI), Persistent Surveillance, Wide Area Motion Imagery\n(WAMI), Spectral Identification) for multiple airborne platforms, including medium and high altitude platforms; development and demonstration of advanced tactical sensor and associated TPED processing algorithms and tools (automatic registration, automatic and assisted target detection, network centric warfare). Development of\nintegrated multi-sensor capabilities to detect and identify obscured targets (OT); development and implementation of standards (Common GMTI\/DMTI, National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF); and monitoring and enhancement of Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) product quality (radar and EO\/IR imagery, GMTI data, and spectral information) and timeliness throughout the image chain (from sensor to user). Development and integration of airborne sensors to support an open systems architecture\npod capability. These efforts focus on reducing the find, fix and track elements of the time critical targeting kill-chain timeline while improving operator and decisionmaker efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning."

The primary efforts in this line include maturing and experimenting with Manned Un-Manned Teaming (in conjunction with Robotic Combat Vehicle) and maturing and experimenting with a variety of technologies that could potentially be added to the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) or legacy combat vehicles (such as Abrams and Bradley) in future incremental upgrades.  \n\nPrototyping allows for aggressive innovation (provides a bridge from S&T investment to vehicle integration and operational use), informs requirements through User Evaluations, ensures requirements are met, mitigates capability gaps and reduces integration risks. The strategy for NGCV will be to focus on delivering incremental experimental prototypes to the warfighter to demonstrate Manned Un-Manned Teaming (MUM-T) in conjunction with Robotic Combat Vehicles (RCV), to integrate technologies to maintain overmatch while demonstrating crew task reductions through crew augmentation enabled by optimized Warfighter Machine Interface (WMI) and sensor fusion.\n\nAdditionally, funding will support concept development, trade studies, technical\/operational\/affordability analyses to assess future concepts and designs for the Next Generation Tank (NGT). The analysis of these concepts will assist in targeting and maturing the correct S&T technologies to provide the next generation capabilities to the warfighter. This funding will also support the integration of a powertrain system in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment to buy back lost mobility due to increased combat vehicle platform weight. The effort will be focused on maturation of the engine and transmission for production. In addition, this funding will support technology maturation, integration risk reduction, and qualification of key lethality\/weapon system and sensor technologies to support current and future increments of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV)."

The MET-D Phase II efforts will continue system level prototype development and integration; maintain system level software; and develop software stability upgrades based on results from the MET-D Phase I Experimentation.  The platform software upgrades will support integration of advanced technologies, improved Warfighter Machine Interface (WMI), and improvements for Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) command and control.  Based on feedback from the Phase I Experiment, MET-D Phase II will also update the software system integration laboratory (SIL), crew station SIL, and software test benches in order to simulate integrated system functionality prior to physical integration for Phase II.  The MET-D Phase II effort will also begin to build prototypes with increased capability provided from the next increment of S&T technological deliverables.  The effort will begin with the purchase of long lead materials and technologies, design of the Phase II prototype upgrades for integration of the technologies, and system software updates.  The effort will continue the refinement and maturation of foundational architectures and technologies for power and mobility, lethality, protection, and situational awareness.  The effort will conduct the development engineering effort for maturation and integration of technologies necessary to support Next Generation Combat Vehicles, such as powertrain and running gear, indirect driver's vision and situational awareness technologies, sensors, crew interfaces and autonomous systems for crew augmentation, lethality solutions, high voltage power architecture, data architecture, communications, active and adaptive protection solutions and payloads."

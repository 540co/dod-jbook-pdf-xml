Larger in scope, scale and risk Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) are selected for their high-payoff and potential to revolutionize operational concepts. The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the INP Program. These investments define the future of U.S. naval forces. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate PE, 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes Advanced Technology Development. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy. \n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and\/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments)."

When released into the railgun, an electric pulse launches the projectile at speeds up to Mach 6. EMRG will bring new capabilities, increased capacity and improved operational economy to fleet operations at sea. With its increased velocity and extended range, the EM Railgun provides multi-mission potential for hypersonic missile defense, anti-air & surface warfare, and naval surface fire support. EMRG is a multi-year effort in various stages of research and development within with the Navy's Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) family of RDT&E programs. The Activity identified in Project Unit 2481 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

When released into the railgun, an electric pulse launches the projectile at speeds up to Mach 6. EMRG will bring new capabilities, increased capacity and improved operational economy to fleet operations at sea. With its increased velocity and extended range, the EM Railgun provides multi-mission potential for hypersonic missile defense, anti-air & surface warfare, and naval surface fire support."

Potential adversaries are investing in advanced technologies that will challenge our advantages in the critical information domain. Nation states and non-state actors seek to degrade our command and control capabilities, networks and computer systems. Cyber threats continue to grow and rapidly proliferate. Technologies developed in this R-2 Activity will enable the warfighter to take immediate, appropriate action at any time, against any desired adversary, target or network by assuring that autonomous, continuous analyses of intelligence, persistent surveillance and open information sources have, at all times, optimized the possible courses of action based on commander's guidance. Technologies within this activity will foster operational endurance and enable sustained operations and resiliency for warfighters and platforms through enhanced cyber security\/protection.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

HIJENKS increases operational access by disrupting land-based infrastructure facilities tied to adversary systems, decreases cost exchange ratios through non-kinetic engagement, and addresses targets previously restricted due to collateral damage concerns\/moral hardening. It expands the competitive space in the electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt, degrade, and destroy critical electronic targets. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3416 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the HIJENKS INP effort. \n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

LOCUST will provide ISR and precision loitering munitions capable of being launched from air, surface, ground, and sub-surface platforms to conduct both singular and swarm operations across battlespace in conjunction with Joint and manned operations. It will demonstrate multi-domain launch and strike operations, heterogeneous air platform payloads, unmanned from unmanned operations, distributed control of the strike mission, and refined cost elements for critical technologies that have supply chain assurance addressed. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3423 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the LOCUST INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

AMOS is a mobile observing system of systems node that enables 2-way communications, under-ice vehicle navigation, and extended-duration autonomy in the complex Arctic environment. AMOS will provide a persistent, mobile, autonomous capability to monitor the operational environment and maritime operations of potential adversaries in the Arctic Ocean. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3450 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the AMOS INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

CLAWS will demonstrate autonomous missions in denied waters, develop and demonstrate autonomous technologies for survivability of large UUVs, and develop autonomy and launch capabilities for special mission payloads. CLAWS will be able to complete missions 1&2 against near peer adversary defenses, maintain critical communication with Navy C2\/Fires and provide critical ISR information. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3451 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the CLAWS INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

ELEKTRA will demonstrate AI\/ML ability to coordinate kinetic\/non kinetic effects autonomously with heterogeneous platforms, the ability to operate in degraded environments for hours and the ability to coordinate and execute domain kill chains simultaneously. It will deploy artificial intelligent (AI) and machine learning (ML) architecture, neural networked computing and large data handling to enable real time, force level effects assignment, coordination and resource management. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3452 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the ELEKTRA INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

Hypersonic Booster will develop a CVN-capable HAWC All-Up-Round (AUR) for air-launched flight demonstration that will require a 25% reduction in overall length to fit in a CVN weapons elevator. The goal from the outset will be to leverage DARPA-developed HAWC program for naval applications. It will flight test a CVN compliant, HAWC AUR to demonstrate airframe and booster propulsion technologies. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3453 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the Hypersonic Booster INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans.

Hypersonic Booster will develop a CVN-capable HAWC All-Up-Round (AUR) for air-launched flight demonstration that will require a 25% reduction in overall length to fit in a CVN weapons elevator. The goal from the outset will be to leverage DARPA-developed HAWC program for naval applications. It will flight test a CVN compliant, HAWC AUR to demonstrate airframe and booster propulsion technologies."

                            "val": "The Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV) project will develop and test a 132 ft. unmanned surface vehicle with ocean-spanning range, months of endurance, good seakeeping, and substantial payload.  The vessel will have a high level of autonomy for independent operations under sparse supervisory control and have utility for a variety of Navy missions.  MDUSVs capable of deployed blue-water operations with operator trust in safe, reliable operation, long-range and endurance autonomous operations. This will create a new paradigm for Navy surface force, a hybrid manned\/unmanned force, and enable new tactics in performing naval missions. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3454 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the MDUSV INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

MINERVA will develop AI and Machine-Learning (ML) capabilities to improve mission planning, intelligence gathering, execution and assessment. Minerva will deliver next-generation decision aids by combining operations research with emerging AI capabilities to create learning, self-adaptive automation that supports Composite Warfare Commander's (CWC) and their staffs at the Fleet, Force and Group echelons. It will establish a DevOps environment that includes warfighter staffs in the development and integration of new capabilities. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3455 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the MINERVA INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

FSUSW will address three thrusts identified in the Undersea Warfare Development Command's document, \"Full Spectrum Undersea Warfare Concept of Operations (CONOPS)\". These thrusts are: advanced offensive missions for submarines, subsea and seabed warfare, and distributed undersea warfare. Distributed undersea warfare technology will enable full participation of all undersea warfare assets in the Navy's Distributed Maritime Operations concept. FSUSW missions this Project addresses include Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Anti Surface Warfare, Strike, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Mine Warfare, and Subsea and Seabed Warfare (SSW). The FSUSW Project includes the Affordable Mobile ASW Surveillance System (AMASS) research and will leverage technology developed in the separate PE 06022792N, Project Unit 3450, AMOS. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3456 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the FSUW INP effort.\n\nThe efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

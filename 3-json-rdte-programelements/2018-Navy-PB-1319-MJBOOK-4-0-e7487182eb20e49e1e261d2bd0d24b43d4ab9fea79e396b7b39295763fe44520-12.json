These efforts will be part of the integrated Developmental\/Operational Testing approach.\n\nContinued use of Integrated Product Teams to support development of the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) and Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP), and initiated development of the Acquisition Strategy and other supporting Milestone documentation."

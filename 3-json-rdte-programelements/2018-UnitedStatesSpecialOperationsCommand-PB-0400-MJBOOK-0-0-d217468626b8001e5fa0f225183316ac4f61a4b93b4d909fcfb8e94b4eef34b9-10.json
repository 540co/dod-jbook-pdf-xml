            "val": "This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  \n\nMISO:\nThis project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production\/distribution\/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.\n\nWeapons Systems:\nThis project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.\n\nSoldier Protection and Survival Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system development and testing to meet continually emerging Counter RC-IED threats. \n\nBody Armor and Associated Equipment:\nThis project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.\n\nVisual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Programs in this area include binocular\/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.\n\nCommunications Equipment and Electronics Systems:\nThis project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.\n\nTactical Systems Development:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. \n\nTactical Radio Systems:\nThis project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied\/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.\n\nMunitions Development:\nThis project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign\/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements."

Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment by providing the operator with hearing protection and clothing systems, as well load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF, while conducting varied missions, and personnel safety equipment.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\nSOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system mounts.  \n\nTactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication, mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. \n\nCounter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future RC-IED threats used by terrorist networks."

The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. \n\n\u2022  SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems providing the transport path for high-capacity, voice, data, video tele-conferencing (VTC), and full motion video at all levels of classification.  It consists of SDN subprograms, transport for intelligence variants, technology insertions and capital equipment replacement.\n\n\u2022  Civil Information Management (CIM).  The CIM Data Processing System (CIMDPS) is an automation system that assists active Civil Affairs (CA) and others engaged in civil-military operations to collect, process, analyze, maintain, mine, and deliver Civil Information and analysis products in support of military operations.  \n\n\u2022  The Special Communications (SPCOM) Enterprise program, formerly justified as the Special Communication Enterprise (SCE) includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field) for worldwide deployed SOF units, often in austere environments with heavy adversarial monitoring."

Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.\n\n- The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) provides SOF operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. The TACLAN consists of Suites, Mission Planning Kits and Field Computing Devices, Coalition Local Area Network, and Full Motion Video Kits."

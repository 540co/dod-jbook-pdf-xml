            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program funds the advanced technology development needed to achieve a responsive, efficient domestic industrial base that affordably meets the warfighters\u2019 needs in a timely manner.  The ManTech program works with DLA\u2019s diverse supply chains to improve manufacturing capability throughout a product's life cycle.  It provides the crucial link between invention and application by maturing, scaling up, and validating advanced manufacturing technology in \u201creal world\u201d environments.  ManTech developments provide a path to low-risk technology implementation for the many small businesses and defense unique suppliers as well as depots and shipyards that are critical to DLA.  By anticipating and addressing production and sustainment problems before they occur, readiness levels increase and sustainment costs are lower.  \n\nDLA ManTech is aligned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  \n\n\u2022 The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA has supply chain focused execution portfolios for food (Subsistence Network Procurement), Castings (Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Advanced Casting Technology), Forgings (Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Forging Advance System Technology), Batteries (Battery Network) and Additive Manufacturing.\n\n\u2022 Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements without relying on foreign sources for microcircuits and critical strategic materials.  This strategic focus area mitigates supply issues caused by the lack of a reliable domestic manufacturing capability to produce products or raw materials needed to build and maintain weapon systems.  The major focus of the program is maintaining a reliable, trusted, domestic source for \u201cnon-procurable\u201d linear and digital microcircuits.  Microcircuit emulation allows the Services to save significant costs by using form, fit and functionally equivalent spare parts rather than redesigning the next-higher-assembly.\n\n\u2022 The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA, the Military Services, DLA industry partners and DLA customers. It includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) programs.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging \u201cModel Based Enterprise\u201d paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected up and down the supply chain and across all DLA Customers and suppliers.  A major focus is to transform DoD engineering data from two-dimensional paper-based products to three-dimensional computer based models, and to develop processes to move from \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF files) to technical data files that can interface directly with industries\u2019 engineering systems. The benefits include shorter product introduction cycles, lower set up-costs for parts production and more economical small batch production."

                            "val": "The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes Strategic Focus Area (SFA) is an R&D effort undertaken with DLA\u2019s suppliers to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of production lead-times, assure DLA managed products meet performance requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs. This SFA includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings\/Forging programs and Additive Manufacturing programs. \n\nThe Battery Network (BATTNET) objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. BATTNET conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for specific groups of batteries. BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of Service approved batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.\n\nThe Subsistence Network (SUBNET) Program is the successor to the Combat Rations Network R&D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program's expanded areas of interest include: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. Desired outcomes include: reduced cost, increased efficiencies, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.\n\nThe Casting program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic casting industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD). Castings works with industry, universities, and the Casting Industry Associations to identify projects to improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation\u2019s foundry industry. The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas within the DLA and DoD.   Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs). Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are castings. This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented, usually in conjunction with the industry associations. These advancements improve the metal casting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter. We will  invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Forging program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic forging industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency. Working with industry, universities, and the Forging Industry Association to identify projects to improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation\u2019s forging industry. The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas within the DLA and DoD.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs). Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Number (NSN) Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are forgings. This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations. These advancements improve the forging supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will  invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DoD weapon systems.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits. DLA is pursing all AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.  The AM effort pursues alternate means of supply for products that are otherwise non-procurable or susceptible to procurement issues due to an unresponsive manufacturing vendor base. The AM effort includes the identification of AM candidates among the population of products that are needed but hard to obtain, costly or have long manufacturing lead times. The AM effort requires management of 3D digital technical and manufacturing data. In addition, the AM effort includes the development of the processes that will tie the designers, engineers, maintainers, logisticians, procurement managers and the vendor base into a seamless AM procurement stream. Potential benefits include products that can address an unfulfilled Warfighter readiness need by reducing production lead times, production costs, storage costs, transportation costs and in some cases fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. DLA R&D will leverage these efforts with Industry, Academia and ongoing Military Service-level agreements (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Department of Energy."

SUBNET plans to improve process capabilities by identifying targets for product, automation and business operation changes, and implementing solutions in the Subsistence Supply Chain to produce such improvements as shorter lead times, higher throughput, reduced inventory and overhead cost, and improved quality. The STPs are required to have a business case, developed in advance to include specific metrics for success as well as return on investment where applicable to ensure that all SUBNET STPs are fully documented, all projects have the potential for implementation in industry; and all projects address a specific DoD\/DLA need.  \n\nThe Castings program will receive a significant increase in funding starting in FY17 to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR 17 process. Projects identified will investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to improve casting supply chains for the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency to support the warfighter.  Contracts will be competitively awarded in FY17.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success.\n\nThe Forging program will receive an increase in funding to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR17 process.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.\n\nThe Battery Network funding will be applied to pursue additional projects including production readiness of lithium conformable soldier batteries, military ground vehicle batteries, and aviation batteries; manufacturing transition of legacy and obsolete lead acid and nickel cadmium batteries to advanced lithium-ion batteries; and battery manufacturing automation and optimization technologies. These projects will address pressing supply chain issues by migrating from declining manufacturing to a high growth industrial base, and will achieve cost reduction by optimizing the manufacturing design, assembly, and test processes.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.\n\nFY 16 \u2013 FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust."

This SFA includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST), the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR), and the Emergent Manufacturing Technology (EMT) portfolios within its scope. \n\nThe MUST Program focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations for DoD to establish a \u201cknowledge-based approach\u201d to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end-to-end supply chain.\n\nThe DLIR program researches core technology to improve the quality, speed, and interoperability of logistics data. DLA must transform business practices and methodologies as the data for weapons systems evolves from traditional formats and delivery methods (such as two-dimensional images and PDF formats) to newer, more innovative methods (such as three-dimensional solid models, object-oriented databases, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web 3C standards). This fundamental shift for DLA is driven by the Model-Based Enterprise approach, which is influencing the way industry is delivering design and development data for weapon systems to the Military Services and the way the Military Services in turn manage and provide the data to DLA. DLA Logistics Operations, DLA Acquisition, DLA Tech\/Quality, and the Defense Standardization Program Office (DSPO) are key stakeholders in the DLIR initiatives to modernize the representation and delivery of weapons systems data. The DLIR program researches and demonstrates the use of innovative technologies to streamline DLA operations; current thrusts include development of logistics data interoperability and availability, and research into the transformation of DLA data repositories to a digitally linked, model-based enterprise. \n\nThe Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.\n\nThe EMT program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems."

Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, biometrics and forensic site exploitation and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities. USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century. USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons. The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate."

This leveraging of funds increases national and commercial systems awareness, demonstrates the tactical utility of national systems and commercial data, test technologies and evaluates operational concepts in biennial Joint Staff Special Projects, and allows for the transition of promising concepts and technologies to other SOF program offices for execution.  \n\n\u2022 JTWS is a SoS leveraging Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)\/Government Off The Shelf, as well as partnerships with other government agencies. The Program of Record (POR) will leverage capabilities requiring minimal modifications wherever possible. JTWS is making deliberate investments to evolve the program into modular\/scalable systems with a framework supporting open architecture, software database and cyber hardened solutions.  JTWS will address the continuously evolving Great Power Competition environments on the Ground, Air, Maritime, Unmanned Aerial System variants, leverage existing partnerships with other government agencies in order to integrate and sustain next generation need, from the Joint Components and as emerging threats require technology modernizations. The contracting strategy is a mixture of full and open competition for prime integrators, broad area announcements, and existing Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.\n\n\u2022   HF-TTL utilizes an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide highly sophisticated TTL and close target audio\/video devices capable of operating in various environments as needed to meet SOF operational requirements. Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, device level modifications, integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.  \n\n\u2022  TVS\/RSTA employs an evolutionary strategy to incorporate the latest state of technology within its product line to provide upgraded next-generation technology insertion of COTS systems and address the changing threat environment to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations. \n\n\u2022   SOFPREP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.\n\n\u2022   ISP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.\n\n\u2022   SSE uses a rapid acquisition strategy to provide next-generation technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities supporting SOF exploitation mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations."

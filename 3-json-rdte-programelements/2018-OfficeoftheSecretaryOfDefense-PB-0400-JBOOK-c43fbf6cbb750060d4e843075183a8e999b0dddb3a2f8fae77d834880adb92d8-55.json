It refines strategies and management planning activities that will (1) provide support to acquisition programs to address trusted microelectronics supply needs; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate trust of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize trust as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to assuring the trust of the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics technology.\n\nThis activity will be coordinated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and will include performers from the DoD Components, the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), other DoD and Intelligence Community science and technology (S&T) organizations and laboratories, defense industry, and the broader commercial industrial base.  It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related S&T activities.  \n\nThis activity implements, maintains and updates the DoD\u2019s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Recognizing that trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a Government-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the government."

Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories have recently been chartered as a Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and\/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technologies, throughput\/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities in a collaborative nature amongst the core technical laboratories, driven by projected and realized out-year demand.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:\n\n\u2022 Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards \n\u2022 Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening\/verification of select, critical parts\n\u2022 Design verification, i.e., verification\/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.\n\nThese improvements will address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.\n\nThis project also develops standards and practices in support of trustworthy designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., trustworthy designs and supply chains.\n\nBeginning in FY 2018, funding for this project has been transferred to BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z to accurately reflect execution of funds in support of the mission."

DoD\u2019s ability to access commercial technology for its custom trusted and assured needs is diminishing as leading-edge suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD\u2019s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce trusted and assured SOTA parts from untrusted sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base IP from exploitation.  It also is intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation of microelectronics trust and assurance.\n\nThis program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD\u2019s microelectronics supply chain and intellectual property (IP), including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It develops advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Trust techniques, active hardware trust control, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.   It also demonstrates, and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.\n\nTechnologies that provide trust and assurance in a broad range of trusted and un-trusted environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the Government\u2019s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, would enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project would also support using a repository of third-party IP to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.\n\nBeginning in FY 2018, funding for this project has been transferred to BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z and BA 5 PE 0605294D8Z."

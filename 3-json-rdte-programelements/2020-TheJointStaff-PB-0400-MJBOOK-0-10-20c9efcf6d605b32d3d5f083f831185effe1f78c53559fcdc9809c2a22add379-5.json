            "val": "These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a joint training environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Simulation System (JSS)\n\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n\n- Air Force JNTC\n\n- Navy JNTC\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training that improves interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving, rather than consuming readiness and creating a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System, consisting of the Joint Theater Level Simulation and the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation, provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO, and multinational partners. The joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners by continuing limited investments ensuring Joint Theater Level Simulation and Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation remain relevant providing reliable, low-cost, small footprint, distributed, and deployable joint training solutions. \n \nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based joint operations core curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training (externally funded); and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 program goals and objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment. Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard."

JKO is a DoD enterprise-wide, Joint individual training toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products, services, and enabling training technology.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD program goals, CJCS high interest training issues, Joint Staff training priorities, and JKO stakeholders (Combatant Commands, Services, and Combat Support Agencies, interagency, and multinational) prioritized training requirements.  JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve all components of the joint content management architecture including:  \n\n1. JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS): Development and enhancement is required to integrate advanced individual and staff training technologies and methodologies with larger scale, collective training exercises, and modernize military training capability with a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit. JKO LCMS is necessary to develop, host and deliver JKO courses, track and report students\u2019 progress, completions and survey results more effectively and efficiently. JKO LCMS extends web-based, distributed access to mission-critical joint training requirements. There are currently over 2.7 million registered users of the JKO LCMS.\n\n2. Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined\/Joint Task Force (C\/JTF) billets. Specifically, C\/JTF \"battle staffs\" will be adequately trained, as individuals and as collective staffs, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and prerequisite JKO courses enable blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises that augment the joint event learning cycle and support  meeting Combatant Commander exercise objectives.\n\n3. JKO mobile application training device development:  Development and enhancements facilitate the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms (cell phones and tablets).  JKO mobile application extends access to training courses and learning resources to personal use of mobile phones and tablets."

Develop, test and deliver two JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS) releases resulting in improved cybersecurity, and a more effective and efficient online training management application that is interoperable with DoD personnel management systems.  Requirements will be derived from CCMD user feedback and DoD training priorities directed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness and the Chairman\u2019s training guidance. The objectives are to provide a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit, and develop content for pre-exercise training and support (as required by the Services) and support individual and unit training for Special Purpose - Marine Air Ground Task Force missions.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve access and the ease of use for the projected ~50,000 daily log-ins and ~550,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS will directly benefit thousands of individuals by providing them global 24\/7 access to mandatory joint training as they prepare to participate in CCMD exercises and real world missions. JKO will also focus on enhancements to improve the management of individuals\u2019 training records and readiness reporting by extending information sharing and web services with DoD personnel management systems.  \n\n2. Develop, test, and deliver four JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS).  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for CCMD exercise participants resulting in heightened preparedness for real world operations.  The SGST will be used as part of the OSD-endorsed blended learning training component in approximately eight CCMD collective training exercises to prepare individuals serving on CCMD required small functional teams and C\/JTF \"battle staffs.\"  \n\n3. JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing its comprehensive plan to enhance the JKO mobile application and mobile training products. JKO\u2019s planned components include courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices while leveraging other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware ported to the JKO mobile application. JKO anticipates the development and conversion of ~200 training courses, eBooks, podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in reduced cost for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide."

As both analog and digital onboard information transport and processing requirements continue to grow, life cycle costs associated with maintaining and upgrading current stove-piped networks aboard naval aircraft systems becomes unsustainable.  The size, weight, power, high data rate and scalability advantages of a single-mode fiber optic network have significant total ownership cost savings implications that will allow the Department of the Navy to more affordably and effectively meet mission requirements well into the future.  The activities funded will provide a networking baseline or standard that can be incorporated into airborne platforms that maximize networking system capability while minimizing associated life cycle costs.  While the development under this program does specifically address airborne platforms where size and weight of the cable plant is particularly important, ultimately the network technology developed will have broad applicability to shipboard and submarine platform network requirements as well."

The program will leverage and enhance the telecommunication standards for optical fiber networks while addressing the SWAP restrictions and severe environmental requirements of military airborne platforms.  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components due to SWAP constraints and the military environment.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered optical fiber components and electronic semiconductors as they apply to highly integrated optical fiber networks.  Ultimately these higher performance components and networks will address the needs for all classes of military platforms."

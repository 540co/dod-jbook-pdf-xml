            "val": "The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority) to correct deficiencies, improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability & maintainability (R&M), reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain engines throughout their service life.  \n\nChanges in aircraft operational parameters caused by changing missions and tasks accelerate new engine problems; Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types\/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational. Engine CIP testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types\/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational. Engine CIP testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

It provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for the F135 propulsion system.  F135 CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), corrects service revealed deficiencies, improves system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability & Maintainability (R&M), reduces propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustains the propulsion system throughout its service life. Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the F135 CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems.  F135 CIP funding is driven by field events and type\/maturity of the propulsion system, not by the total quantity of engines.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational.  F135 CIP, through \"Lead the Fleet\" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.    F135 CIP ensures continued improvements in R&M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&M related CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&M and spares costs.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

As new technologies are introduced to the battlefield (Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface-to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons, etc.) along with evolving warfighting techniques and support operations, the range of capabilities that needs to be covered by  analytic tools needs to expand as well. M&S creation and enhancement can require extensive research in how to properly implement the emerging weapons capabilities as well as demand development of software techniques to implement the changes. Additionally, emerging and continuing focus areas such as Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and ISR demand specific tools of their own for new exploration and development. These focus areas require examination in isolation as well as cross-domain making the problem more complex and increasing the R&D challenges to field new decision support tools.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development as this budget activity includes development efforts to provide new and evolving systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

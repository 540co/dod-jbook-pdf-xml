The Joint Engineering Data Management Information & Control System (JEDMICS) program manages and controls 100,000,000 engineering images and has 13,000 authorized users responsible for over 77,000 user sessions per month. Over 1.2 million digital images are retrieved each month. New data and new users are added each month as DoD re-engineers its business processes to take advantage of digital data that is managed and controlled for corporate reuse. The JEDMICS system is deployed at 5 interoperable sites that service user locations worldwide. Data stored in JEDMICS is used for Logistics Support, Spares re-procurement, Weapons Systems procurement, Engineering, Maintenance, Distribution, Manufacturing, Air National Guard and Deployed Engineering Technical Services organizations. JEDMICS facilitates work process re-design since it brings the electronic drawings to the desktop, shop floor or flight line in real time eliminating walk, wait and slack time to retrieve drawings. Additionally, Administrative Lead Time, Repair Turn Around Time, Engineering Change Proposal processing time, demilitarization time, and all cycle times dependent on engineering data have decreased with the real time availability of digital engineering data. JEDMICS also facilitates Electronic Commerce since it produces digital technical data packages that can be forwarded along with an electronic order. Funds are for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) test, evaluation and integration. JEDMICS development efforts are required to integrate and test COTS upgrades."

The NAVSUP Logistics R&D program has an established infrastructure and business process for ensuring that R&D funds are applied to projects that address high priority enterprise needs established in accordance with OPNAV goals and the NAVSUP Commander's Guidance.\n\nFrom a process perspective, Logistics R&D investments are governed by a NAVSUP enterprise-wide Executive Steering Group (ESG) chaired by the NAVSUP Vice Commander, and comprised of SES and Command leadership representatives. The ESG ratifies capability and technology gaps identified by all activities within the enterprise, and then assesses and prioritizes all proposed Logistics R&D initiatives in accordance with their potential for filling the established gap and generating return on investment.\n\nThe established Logistics R&D business management process has currently identified capability\/technology gaps in the following general areas: 1) the need to develop formalized energy management techniques that focus on energy and resource conservation; increased energy efficiency of new and existing systems and facilities; and increased use of alternative energy products, 2) the need to modernize quality of life (QOL) services to improve overall services, offer additional desired features and reduce total ownership costs, 3) the need to assess clothing protection for the warfighter in areas of thermal\/flame threats, protective footwear, and physical (hearing, vibration, etc.) clothing\/accessories, 4) the need to develop logistics data access and information sharing through enhanced Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and web-based data services, 5) the need to develop a capability that allows Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) repair and modernization tools, 6) the need to leverage breakthrough technologies to improve supply chain processing.  This modest R&D investment will establish a NAVSUP Logistics R&D Program to explore additional technologies and significantly increase potential cost savings."

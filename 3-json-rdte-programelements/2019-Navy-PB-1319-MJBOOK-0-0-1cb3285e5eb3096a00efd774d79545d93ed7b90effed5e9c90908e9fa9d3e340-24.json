Manufacturing Enterprise addresses the development, optimization, and transition of manufacturing enterprise technology to key naval platform suppliers. Emphasis is on affordability for the following shipbuilding platforms: VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS)\/COLUMBIA Class Submarine (CLB), DDG 51 Class Destroyer, CVN 78 Class Carrier, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), and CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopter. Manufacturing enterprise technology areas include, but are not limited to Design for Producibility\/Design for Manufacturability; development of build\/assembly strategies; modeling and simulation technologies; model-based tools and approaches to optimize producibility; intelligent manufacturing planning and factory execution; elimination of inefficiencies in design optimization, material usage, labor utilization, work flow, etc.; supply chain procedures and improvements (such as network centric manufacturing capabilities to facilitate resilient and adaptable supply chains); development of more efficient structural fabrication product lines; and inspection technologies. Energetics efforts concentrate on developing energetics solutions to ensure the availability of safe, affordable, and quality energetics products largely in support of Program Executive Office (PEO) Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS)."

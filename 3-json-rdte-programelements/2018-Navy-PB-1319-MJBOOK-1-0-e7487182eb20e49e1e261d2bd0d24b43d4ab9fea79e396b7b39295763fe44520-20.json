This PE is managed by PMS 320, the Electric Ships Office, located organizationally within PEO SHIPS, responsible for developing Naval Power and Energy Systems that focus power system integration of Directed Energy (DE) and other high powered mission systems as well as platform integration and improving energy efficiency of those components and systems.  The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable and more capable electric power systems for all Navy platforms, focus Navy and industry investments, and reduce total ownership cost.\n\nThis PE serves as the bridge between Science and Technology (S&T) and ship platform and mission systems acquisition programs by identifying prospective applications for S&T research, advanced development, and performing additional product development and qualification when necessary to meet platform or mission system requirements.  This PE also includes HM&E cybersecurity Boundary Defense Capability (BDC) development.  The HM&E systems to be protected from cyber-attack by BDC include Machinery Control Systems, Electric Power Systems, Damage Control and Firefighting, Auxiliary Machinery and Fluid Systems, Engines and Power Transmission Systems,  Gas Turbine Systems, Video Systems, as well as other HM&E systems.  Cybersecurity BDC will allow the ship to better protect, detect, respond, and recover from a cyber attack."

This project supports optimized integration of Directed Energy (DE) and other high powered mission systems, appropriate component and system controls, integration of components and systems into future and current ships, and providing power and energy system solution alternatives to new and existing platforms. \n\nProject developments are aligned with the Navy's 30 year shipbuilding plan via the Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap (TDR), which outlines the way ahead for future developments and provides a basis for coordinated planning and investment by the Navy and private industry. \n\nThis project develops and transitions products that electrically integrate and provide power to mission systems, integrates those components and systems into ship platforms, increases energy efficiency, and provides cybersecurity capabilities for current in-service Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) systems as well as future systems. \n\nPower and Energy Systems combines previously shown Energy Efficiency and Mission Power R2A Accomplishments and Plans to reflect the focus on providing power and energy solutions for warfighting capability.  Energy efficiency is but one of several requirements levied upon these systems and the distinction between mission power and energy efficiency is very difficult to divide out.  The systems developed by this Project are by their very nature the foundation of the ships kill chain, and are developed with efficiency requirements as part of total life cycle cost minimization.  Efforts within Power and Energy Systems are to design, develop, test and integrate shipboard power systems to incorporate advanced sensors, directed energy and other advanced weapons. Design and testing includes modeling and simulation, as well as land based testing, to reduce risk and demonstrate readiness for shipboard use.   \n\nCybersecurity: Develops an approach to implement a cybersecurity Boundary Defense Capability (BDC) for HM&E control systems on surface ships. The HM&E systems to be protected from cyber-attack by BDC include machinery control systems, electric power systems, damage control and firefighting, auxiliary machinery and fluid systems, engines and power transmission systems, gas turbine systems, video systems, as well as other HM&E systems. Design and technical data packages for software and hardware solutions will be developed.  Cybersecurity BDC will allow the ship to better protect, detect, respond, and recover from cyber-attack."

The AG9160RF Gas Turbine Generator (GTG) is an upgrade to the DDG1000 auxiliary gas turbine and will provide increased power to meet DDG51 Flight III requirements for advanced sensors and future weapons with reduction in life cycle costs through increased fuel efficiency over legacy gas turbine generator sets. \n\nDeliver Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) Power Conversion Modules (PCM) units to the Surface Combat System Center (SCSC) Wallops Island, VA for DDG51 Flight III AMDR Developmental Testing (DT).  Continue to provide support for AMDR PCM units during PCM \/ AMDR combat system integration testing and electrical system validation testing at the DDG 51 Flight III test sites. AMDR PCM provides power conversion from ship's 4160 VAC distribution systems to 1000 VDC to support the AMDR on DDG 51 Flight III Class Ships. \n\nContinue planning for future gas turbine operational readiness and fuel efficiency upgrades.\n\nIn order to obtain early insight into the effects of high power and energy mission systems on ships electric power systems, evaluate shipboard power and energy systems, and evaluate power system performance at lower cost than full-scale hardware system testing, simulated electrical system integration testing using power and energy system components will be conducted at the Center for Advanced Power System at Florida State University (FSU CAPS).   This low-cost approach to testing is referred to as Power Hardware In the Loop (PHIL).  PHIL includes development of component computer models that simulate and emulate actual operating machinery components and shipboard power and energy systems.  PHIL testing replaces component models with hardware once hardware development is complete.

IPES adds distributed EM functionality and advanced cyber safe controls to the Integrated Power System of ships such as DDG1000 for enhanced survivability, efficient sharing of power and energy resources between ship propulsion, mission systems and ship service loads.\n\nConduct design review of the ESM prototype for use in Stable Backup Power (SBP) applications, identify necessary modifications required and appropriate test configurations.

HM&E systems to be protected will include Machinery Control Systems, Electric Power Systems, Damage Control and Firefighting, Auxiliary Machinery and Fluid systems, Engines and Power Transmission Systems, Gas Turbine Systems, Video Systems as well as other HM&E systems. Design and technical data packages for software and hardware solutions will be developed.

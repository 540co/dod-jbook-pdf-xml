            "val": "The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences.\n\nThe Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security objectives.  Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk.  This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation.  The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national and homeland security.\n\nThe Cyber Sciences project supported long-term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security.  Information technologies enabled important new military capabilities and drove the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Meanwhile, cyber threats grew in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk.  The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project produced breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.\n\nThe Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing.  In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.\n\nThe Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas.\n\nThe Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems.\n\nThe Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, and manufacturing.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging\/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security.  Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health and improve recovery.  This project also includes efforts to create innovative materials of interest to the military (e.g., self-healing materials)."

However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD.  Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context.  The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges:  (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress; (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into social science models; and (4) developing strategic forecasting and operational decision aiding capabilities that account for local contextual and cultural factors to assess the likely effectiveness of and\/or responses to actions within an Area of Operations.  This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at multiple scales (from small group to cities and\/or regions) and will significantly improve DoD stabilization, deterrence, and\/or gray zone mission outcomes."

This program addresses the challenge of general machine reasoning on par with commonsense human cognition.  MCS is developing computational models that mimic core systems of human cognitive development that are grounded in perceptual, motor, and memory modalities; a simulated interaction and learning environment to support machine manipulation of grounded concept models; and commonsense knowledge repositories to support AI system development.

The SD2 program will collect raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, develop computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and create data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design.

In supervised ML, a system learns through the use of labeled training examples to recognize and categorize attributes of images, text, or speech.  Humans provide these training-data examples to ML systems and with enough labeled data, it is generally possible to build useful models. Obtaining large amounts of labeled data can be costly.  LwLL is addressing this problem by creating ML algorithms that learn and adapt more efficiently than current ML approaches, and by formally deriving the limits of machine learning and adaptation.  LwLL aims to create ML systems that are easier to train and use in variable, unpredictable, real-world environments, especially where training data is costly or sparse."

CWC aims to provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense and encode aspects of the physical world in a perceptual structure, and to use this structure to disambiguate language.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding.

To address these limitations the Foundational AI science thrust will focus on the development of new learning architectures that enhance AI systems' ability to handle uncertainty, reduce vulnerabilities, and improve robustness for DoD AI systems.  One focus area of this thrust is the ability to embed known physics, mathematics, and other prior knowledge to improve performance of AI systems, particularly for problem sets involving incomplete, sparse and noisy data.  Another focus area is the development of a model framework for quantifying performance expectations and limits of AI systems as trusted human partners and collaborators.  A third focus area is the development of new tools and methodologies that enable AI approaches for accelerated scientific discovery.  The technology advances achieved under the Foundational AI Science thrust will ultimately remove technical barriers to exploiting AI technologies for scientific discovery, human-AI collaboration, and other DoD relevant applications."

Together these skills enable human collaboration and teamwork at all scales, whether the setting is a playing field or a military mission.  The ASIST program aims to develop technologies to enable machines to exhibit similar capabilities for collaboration and teamwork with humans, capabilities which can be termed artificial social intelligence.  These would include the capability to infer the goals and situational knowledge of human partners, to predict what human partners will need, and to formulate context-aware actions having high value to a team.  The ASIST program is developing proof-of-concept software agents that demonstrate a machine theory of mind and the capability to participate with humans in an effective team by representing and helping to maintain shared models.  ASIST aims to provide the basis for machines that can participate effectively with humans on tasks where teamwork is required."

One expected benefit of this approach is the emphasis on features that humans find salient, thus reducing the number of counterintuitive mistakes made by AI methods and minimizing the vulnerability to adversarial attacks, both in training data and in operations. Another expected benefit relates to human interaction, because the use of domain concepts provides a built-in framing for explanations to human partners. An additional expected benefit is the facilitation of more rapid learning processes including potentially transfer learning and one-shot learning. The APTAI program will make use of specific national security domains to drive assessment and transition of these initial concepts. Candidate domains include undersea autonomous navigation, imagery analysis, multi-modal reasoning, and games in support of strategy and planning."

Formal methods are techniques for reasoning about and proving various properties for software code or design models, generally focusing on logical relationships that connect specifications and models with executable code. A key to scalability is to focus more narrowly on particular quality or functional attributes, such as security and safety, rather than address all features and functions of the components of a software system. A second key to scalability is to provide for composability, which enables trustworthy components to be efficiently assembled into trustworthy systems. The FMaS program will accelerate this new scalable formal methods paradigm by extending formal methods techniques, tools, and practices along several dimensions, including (1) the range of properties and qualities that are modeled and reasoned about, such as relating to security, safety, performance, fault tolerance, and real-time, (2) the complexity and the size of systems and their supply chains, including issues related to composability, (3) efficiency of formal methods-related modeling, tooling, and engineering practices, including more natural integration into mainstream tooling and practices, (4) ability to rapidly co-evolve systems and associated evidence, for example to respond to rapid evolution of threats and associated mission concepts, and (5) ease of use for non-expert developers and evaluators. FMaS aims to create formal methods applicable to software systems of the size and complexity commonly encountered in military and civilian mission-critical systems, and to speed the adoption of these methods into practice and tooling."

The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continuance of operation.  BRASS creates tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes."

This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function.  Reducing the size, weight, and power of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals as well as enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials.  For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.  The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems."

For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal.  This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide.  Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF.  This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size.  AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system.  This new capability would enable a range of applications including wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links.  Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels."

The capabilities of the developed microrobots will be tested through a series of specific tests at the end of the program.  The primary technical improvements needed for untethered mobility of centimeter-sized robotic platforms are in the efficiency, robustness, and force output of millimeter-scale actuators and in the power and energy capacity of batteries and chip-level power converters. Successful execution of the SHRIMP program will advance the micro-robotics field, allowing for practical robots to assist in disaster relief efforts in environments for which traditional robotics cannot efficiently operate due to their larger size.

PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare.  While PNT needs are usually met by using the global positioning system (GPS), GPS signals are vulnerable to a variety of disruption modalities and a fallback from GPS is essential.  Currently, in the absence of GPS, tactical grade clocks and tactical\/navigation grade Inertial Measurement Units can provide GPS-like accuracy for the short term.  However, longer-term GPS independent strategies are still desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable PNT accuracy better than GPS for short durations."

Electrical bandgaps determine, among other things, a transistor's maximum operating voltage, current density, thermal resistance, frequency and color (wavelength) of light emission. Consequently, wide band gaps have considerable interest for the DoD due to the need for high operating temperatures, currents, voltages and frequencies often required by emerging high power, agile Radio Frequency (RF) sources for radar, communications, directed energy and electronic warfare. This program will overcome the fundamental materials and device challenges that currently prevent implementation of UWBG materials into power, RF, and optoelectronic devices and systems. These challenges include reliably manufacturing low-defect substrates, heteroepitaxial material growth, and high concentration p-type and\/or n-type doping."

Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon.

Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components.  As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization.  This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits and to incorporating privacy and security protections.  Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems.  The program will also explore architecture options for physically protecting sensitive information.   Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create secure and specialized hardware that does not depend on continued improvements in silicon transistors. Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-02."

To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge.  L2M will explore network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.

Additional research will explore development of a complex theoretical framework for maximum information extraction from complex scenes to guide development of new imaging technologies.

This program will investigate approaches for identifying pathogens based on specific behaviors, or phenotypes, such as niche finding or cell toxicity.  Unlike current methods, which rely on a priori knowledge of the pathogen and cannot detect or otherwise analyze unknown threats, this approach will handle scenarios involving engineered or undiscovered bacterial pathogens that do not have known hallmarks.  Advances in this area will produce a completely new capability to assess the emergence of pathogens and to detect pathogens that have been specifically engineered to evade detection by traditional methods.  Resulting systems may be used to alert deployed military personnel operating around the world to new biothreats, or in response to a U.S.-based discovery, outbreak, or pandemic."

This program will develop approaches that combine high-resolution biosensors to track the healing process in real-time with bioactuators to stimulate restoration where and when needed.  The primary challenge to achieving this is the lack of a closed-loop interface that can manipulate highly complex signaling pathways in wounds and the developmental interdependencies that scale from cell to tissue.  The program will develop new methods to convert dense multi-modal information into the body's native repair processes, and will leverage artificial intelligence to guide the delivery of the signals necessary for healing.  Advances from this program will produce bioactuators that can release diverse stimuli with high spatial and temporal resolution, and biosensors that provide the requisite in situ measurement to guide the healing process."

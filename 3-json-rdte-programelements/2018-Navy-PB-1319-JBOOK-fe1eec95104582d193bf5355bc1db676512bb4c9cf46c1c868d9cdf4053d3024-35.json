Particular sensors or data sources with unique naval service mission needs are targeted to accelerate acquisition or ensure threshold accomplishment of Joint or converged national program plans. The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program will collect global microwave radiometry and sounding data to produce microwave imagery and other meteorological and oceanographic data. Conical Microwave Imager Sounder (CMIS) can be viewed as the follow-on instrument to the Special Sensor Microwave (SSM) instruments Navy developed for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. These CMIS sensors will be acquired as part of the JPSS architecture which supports these Navy requirements in the future. Maintenance of rigorous sensor calibration and data validation for operational SSM instruments continues along with algorithm development in support of fleet applications. The Advanced Altimeter technologies will improve radar altimeter resolution and aerial coverage to support Navy requirements for sea surface topography measurement in the littorals."

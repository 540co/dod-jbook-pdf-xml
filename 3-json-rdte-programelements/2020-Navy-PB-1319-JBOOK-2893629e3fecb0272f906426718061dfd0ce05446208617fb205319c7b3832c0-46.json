This PE will support of the development of procedures to enable the approval and manufacturing of items requested from Marines. This involves the development of Marine Corps Policy, an approval process, engineering analysis and testing, establishment of facilities to produce prototype additive manufactured parts and development of training to support the Marine Corps use of additive manufacturing. This initiative incorporates development of strategic partnerships with other DoN Systems Commands and field activities to develop DoN standards, processes and other associated acquisition activities to support future use of additive manufacturing in DoN acquisition and readiness areas.\n\nThe Next Generation Logistics (NexLog) project supports cost associated with the research and development, experimentation and limited, rapid fielding of emerging logistics capabilities necessary to enable the Fleet Marine Forces to execute the Marine Corps Operating Concept and inform logistics policies.  These emerging logistics capabilities include development of autonomous ground, surface and sub-surface materiel distribution systems; development of operational and tactical, in-field digital fabrication capabilities; and, the development of sensor-driven logistics information technology.  This element also supports development of strategic partnerships with DoN Systems Commands and field activities in order to leverage their capabilities and align DoN standards and processes, while furthering the use of additive manufacturing, and other emerging logistics technologies, to increase warfighter readiness, capability, survivability and effectiveness."

The development of enabling technologies that will increase the speed needed to detect an impending support requirement as well as the speed of response to satisfy that requirement. This involves the deployment of sensor technologies, collection of clean, properly tagged data, and the ability to electronically mine and monitor that sensor data for anomalies and micro-patterns that will provide logistics intelligence augmentation, thereby increasing Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) lethality."

These emerging capabilities help to create a central hub for data that permits the application of analytical and data-driven algorithms that can have operational and strategic affects with future efforts that may be leveraged by fires, medical, and drones. \n\n-Initiate other D2L efforts include sensor driven logistics, augmented reality, logistics artificial intelligence pilots and condition based maintenance efforts meant to increase predictive maintenance, focus resources and provide assets at the critical points to avoid backlogs and Operating Force burdens."

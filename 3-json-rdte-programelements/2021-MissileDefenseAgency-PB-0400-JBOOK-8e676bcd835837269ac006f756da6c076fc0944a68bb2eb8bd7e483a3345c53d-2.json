MDA explores potential new MDS capabilities by leveraging the creativity and innovation of the Nation's industry, universities, and national laboratories to conduct advanced technology development. MDA also pursues advanced technology development through cooperative international research agreements between U.S. and foreign universities of allied nations. The program manages the selection process and administers the Missile Defense Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program element (PE), 0605502C.  SBIR topics and projects are selected annually based on needs across the MDS and executed in partnership with sponsoring intra-agency organizations.  These mechanisms foster a cooperative environment between small businesses, prime contractors, and MDA elements to yield reduced cost and increased returns on investment for successful technology integration efforts.\n\nMDA's Advanced Technology Development Project assesses the feasibility and technical performance of the advanced research and development efforts through in-house means and partnerships with Department of Defense and other government agency laboratories.  MDA provides independent assessments, demonstration and experimentation environments, and other concept assessment capabilities.  The output of the experimentation, demonstration, and laboratory efforts provide risk, transition feasibility, and performance assessments, concept assessment data and analysis, and an overall improvement in the state-of-the-art of advanced technology evaluation. The culmination of research, development, and assessment is the commercialization and transition of promising technologies into the MDS."

Additionally, PWS includes personnel to support global deployments performing deployment site preparation and activation, and provides facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations worldwide. Other MDA wide costs include: physical and technical security; civilian drug testing; audit readiness; the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program; legal services and settlements; travel and agency training; office, equipment, vehicle, and warehouse leases; utilities and base operations across multiple geographic locations; commercial and ancillary facility services; management of all facility aspects regardless of lifecycle stage; supplies and maintenance; compliance with statutory environmental requirements; data and unified communications support; materiel and readiness and central property management of equipment; Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (FSRM) program, (formerly Real Property Maintenance) to keep the Department's inventory of facilities in good working order; and similar operating expenses. PWS is allocated on a pro-rata basis across most Agency PEs and therefore fluctuates per PE by fiscal year based on the total Agency budget in that fiscal year."

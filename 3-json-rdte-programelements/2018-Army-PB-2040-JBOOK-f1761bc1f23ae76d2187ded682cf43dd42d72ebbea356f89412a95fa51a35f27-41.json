JNED was renamed JTN and the Joint Executive Program Office (JPEO) JTRS transitioned to the JTNC in FY 2013, in accordance with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 11 July 2012. FY 2013 and FY 2014 JTNC funding was provided by the JTN Program via PE 0604280N and PE 0605030A, respectively.\n\nAs per the JTNC ADM dated 20 January 2014, JTN and JTNC became separate entities and PE 0605031A (Project Code EF5) was created for JTN.  The 2014 ADM also directed that the waveform development and sustainment responsibilities transition to the Services in 4QFY15.  PdM Waveforms (SRW, WNW) transitioned to PM TR; PdM Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) transitioned to PEO C3T PM Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) PdM Tactical Cyber and Network Operations (TCNO); and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and Link16 transitioned to the Navy.  For FY 2015 and out, the Army PE 0605031 contains only the JTN (Waveforms & JENM) RDT&E funding.  As part of the joint program budget strategy for JENM, each Military Department (MILDEP) budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&E funds for joint efforts.  Joint funding is held at the Navy PE 0605030N and Air Force PE 0605030F.  Prior to the year of execution, the funding is consolidated in the Army PE (0605031A) for execution."

Functional software applications will use SRW radio enabled sets over Internet Protocol (IP) capable networks and sub-networks. SRW will be interoperable with higher throughput, IP based network waveforms, such as Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW). As applicable, these IP-based networking waveforms will enable information exchanges through the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the soldier and provide entirely new capabilities for battlefield communications and information sharing. SRW is currently ported on 21 different radio platforms with 9 different vendors. \n\nFY15 effort: JTN Enterprise Over-the-Air Management (OTAM) design provides Non-Developmental Integration (NDI) vendors a portable Operating Environment (OE)-centric OTAM approach extensible to SRW, WNW, and future networking waveforms.

The Navy and USMC funding combined equal the other third of the JENM program funding.  Prior to the year of execution, Navy and Air Force funding is consolidated in the Army PE (0605031A) and software sustainment funds are realigned from RDT&E to O&M,A PE (4326750A) to support the joint program acquisition strategy.  USMC funding will be provided on an annual basis via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).

Avenger provides day\/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability.  \n\nFunding provided for the Avenger PIP ensures that Avenger is viable and sustainable through the end of program life. The Avenger Modification \u2013 Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) keeps Avenger sustainable and relevant until replaced by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2- Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) in the Fiscal Year (FY) 31 timeframe.  \n\nThe Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low- altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM). Stinger is deployable from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS. The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.\n\nA SHORAD \u201cshoot off\u201d in 4QFY17 will evaluate industry solutions for mitigating the maneuver SHORAD capability gap. The intent is to determine which industry products that the Army could rapidly field to maneuver units between FY19-25.\n\nFunding provided for the Stinger PIP addresses obsolescence, completes design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuse (PROX) into the existing Stinger Block I missile."

Avenger provides day\/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability. Avenger can be air dropped, lifted by helicopter and is air transportable.  The system employs up to eight Stinger missiles to counter aerial threats and a M3P gun for close-in ground and air threats.  The gunner can visually track targets through use of a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR) that can detect and track targets during the day and at night.  An on-board laser range finder provides range.  An IFF system aids in the identification of friendly aircraft in order to minimize the potential for fratricide.  The Avenger fleet has 170 systems that are equipped with a digital Slew-to-Cue (STC) capability to speed target detection and engagement.  Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command Control and Intelligence System (C2I) passes radar target information to the Avenger for display.  The operator can then select a target for engagement from the display, which will automatically slew the turret and place the target in the gunner\u2019s FLIR field of view.\n\nFY2018 Base dollars in the amount of $2.723 million provides funding to ensure the Avenger is viable and sustainable through the end of its program life.

The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.\n\nThe addition of a PROX to the current Block I configuration will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3\/5\/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.\n\nA SHORAD \u201cshoot off\u201d in 4QFY17 will evaluate industry solutions for mitigating the maneuver SHORAD capability gap.

Funding addresses obsolescence issues in the Seeker Dual-Detector Assembly (UV Diodes), Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Roll Frequency Sensor (RFS), and the Electronics Assembly. These assemblies face Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and exponentially higher costs due to legacy materials and processes. This obsolescence mitigation will allow to Army to increase Stinger reliability and effectiveness while reducing costs as it dramatically increases the number of Stinger missiles inducted into the Service Life Extension Program. Developmental improvements include increased detection range, visual identification, and night operations capability."

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) is unique in the Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDTE) portfolio due to the comprehensive scope of RDTE Installations Management responsibilities on Army Kwajalein Atoll. These responsibilities include provision of the totality of Municipal Services required to maintain a strategically vital Army Garrison and mission support infrastructure in a logistically challenging remote Pacific island chain. \n\nThe United States (U.S.) Army Kwajalein Atoll\/Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (USAKA\/RTS), located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) supported by US Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA).  USAKA\/RTS supports test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs and provides space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  USAG-KA provides Base Operations (BOS), Infrastructure and Services support to the USAKA\/RTS mission and other resident Programs.  These programs include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational\/demonstration\/validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and space experiments.  Operations at Kwajalein Atoll are predominantly government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) and are dependent upon associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  The PE funds contractors to accomplish O&M for both the RTS instrumentation suite and installation\/base operations and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.   The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at RTS, are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world providing critical intelligence data.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and AEGIS weapon systems), and NASA space experiments."

Realignment into, and addition of, activities in FY17 and FY18 provides a more logical functional segmentation of installation management programs and aligns programs into more discrete\/recognizable bins.  This breakout facilitates improved programming visibility, articulation, justification, and definition of the unique scope of Army Kwajalein Atoll Installation Services.  Activities included in the FY16 \"Municipal Services\" activity include: Base Operations Support, Logistical Support, Medical\/Dental Support, Army Family Housing (AFH) Operations, Army Airfields (AAF) and Heliports (AHP), Army Community Services (ACS), Child and Youth Services (CYS), Engineering Services, Soldier Recreation and Community Support, Fire and Emergency Services (FES), Financial Management (FM) Activities, Food Services, Unaccompanied Housing, Materiel Maintenance, Installation Command and Management, Physical Security Matters, Army Security Programs, Supply Logistics, Transportation Services, Utilities, Environmental Quality, and Anti-Terrorism (AT).

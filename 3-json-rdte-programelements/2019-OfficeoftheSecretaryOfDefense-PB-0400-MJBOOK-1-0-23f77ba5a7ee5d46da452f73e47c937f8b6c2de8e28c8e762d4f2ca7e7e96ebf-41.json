This project also manages the Test & Evaluation (T&E) career field and curriculum for the DoD acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&E within DoD, and prepares reports to Congress as required.  Specific activities include the following:\n\n- The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense DT&E (DASD(DT&E)) ensures that test strategies beginning at Milestone A, are documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  DASD(DT&E) reviews and approves\/disapproves the developmental test and evaluation strategy within the TEMPs.\n- Provide formal DT&E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the acquisition decision-makers on the readiness of programs to release the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) pre Milestone B, and begin production, Milestone C, with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle. \n- Managing the Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE).  Over the last four years, the STAT COE has supported over 40 Acquisition Program Managers in the development of statistically optimized test programs.  These efforts have resulted in 175 more efficient and effective test plans and a test cost avoidance of about $160M.\n- Coordinate with the Test Resources Management Center (TRMC) to identify DoD test infrastructure gaps and support development of the TRMC strategic plan.\n- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering (SE) to ensure that the DT&E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the SE and development planning processes of the Department.\n- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and cybersecurity in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).\n- As the T&E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance the T&E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training."

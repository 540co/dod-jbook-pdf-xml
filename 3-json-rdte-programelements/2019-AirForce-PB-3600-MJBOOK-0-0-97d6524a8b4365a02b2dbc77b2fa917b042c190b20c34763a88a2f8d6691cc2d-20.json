            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates technologies to support Air Force electronic combat warfighting capabilities. The program focuses on developing components, subsystems, and technologies with potential aerospace combat, special operations, and airlift electronic combat applications. It develops and demonstrates technologies for integrating electronic combat sensors and systems into a fused and seamless whole. It integrates and focuses research efforts in electronic warfare and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding. It develops and demonstrates technologies for navigation and timing in radio frequency (RF)\ncontested and denied environments. It develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for RF electronic combat suites and advanced warning and countermeasure technologies to defeat electro-optical, infrared, and laser threats to aerospace platforms. It also develops and demonstrates technologies that identify and mitigate avionics system cyber vulnerabilities as well as protects avionics and other critical technologies. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602601F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F,  and 0602298F.\"\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It is designed to apply developed vulnerability discovery, vulnerability mitigation, and cyber protection technology to avionics systems and components and embedded systems. This involves technologies for trusted sensors and trusted systems that deter exploitation of our critical hardware and software. This project aims to develop cyber resilience and protect systems through adaptation of the system to the threat.  It demonstrates these technologies in open and adaptable architectures for system integration in field demonstrations and proves out the technologies through rapid integration of sensors and architectures for technology transition. It integrates research efforts in electronic and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding."

            "val": "Currently fielded satellite communications (SATCOM), terrestrial, and Tactical Data Links (TDLs) will be adversely affected during operations in contested Anti-Access\/Area-Denial (A2\/AD) environments.  The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare capable of advanced jamming and signal collection techniques that are rapidly evolving to become more capable and agile.  Department of Defense (DoD) advances in smart sensors and smart weapons have an urgent need for more resilient networks than tactical data links of today.  In FY 2016, the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) returned with a new focus on developing enabling technologies for Joint assured communications networks.  The goals of this program are: to mitigate degradation across battlespace tiers and domains, and to provide agility that will support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders, Joint Force Commanders, and deployed forces.\n\nThe DoD\u2019s current TDLs platforms and capabilities are not sufficiently protected from emerging adversary threats and contain insufficient capacity for future needs.  In order to enable the promise of net-centric operations for the warfighter, the next generation of airborne, surface, and ground tactical networks must provide greater affordability, higher network capacity, greater durability against electronic attack, better network connectivity, and faster response times to the changing demands from airborne, maritime, and ground users.  Many line-of-sight (LOS), beyond LOS, and SATCOM waveforms have been integrated onto platforms for various missions.  These waveforms necessarily exhibit tradeoffs in target performance attributes including capacity, latency, protection, and complexity.  As a result, no single waveform capability will be able to satisfy all emerging mission needs emphasizing the need for interoperability and software defined waveforms.  The challenge is to understand the essential needs of the users, avoid needless redundancy, develop affordable capabilities, and integrate separate capabilities into a cohesive network.  This research will develop transformative technologies to ensure performance in contested A2\/AD environments by focusing on future communications networks that are a \u201cleap ahead\u201d of today\u2019s capabilities."

The primary threat is from advanced jamming, signal collection, and geolocation techniques that are rapidly evolving to become more capable and agile.  DoD advances in smart sensors and weapons demand robust tactical waveforms and networks with greater capacity but lower cost than communication links of today.\n\nThe Future Autonomous Battlespace Radio Frequency with Integrated Communications (FABRIC) program is developing next generation communications layer architecture for tactical networks for operations in anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threat environments.  This architecture will deliver capacity and affordability to enable future smart sensors and smart weapons.  The network architecture is flexible enough to support Commander\u2019s Intent in any mission, environment, operating tactical platform, and weapon system under various threat conditions.  FABRIC\u2019s efforts focus on developing the advanced component technologies, such as Anti-Jam (AJ), Low Probability of Intercept(LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Low Probability of Exploitation (LPE) waveforms; adaptive processing algorithms; adaptive antenna technologies (transmit\/receive\/nulling); adaptive power control; Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)\/Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) techniques; self-healing mechanisms and cyber hardening; and advanced routing to ensure Quality of Service.  The guiding tenets for creating this new Command, Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) capability encompass enabling new missions, i.e. providing resilient tactical data links, communications and networking \u201cservice level\u201d capabilities, interoperation, cost (affordable), and improved performance in terms of military value.\n\nBased on the developed thresholds and objectives for the required network architecture, the specific advanced component technologies were prioritized and form the foundation of the FABRIC design.  Through simulation and field experimentation, FABRIC is verifying the technology in operationally relevant environments against representative threats, and facilitates the migration and transition of these technologies to service platforms, radios, and other combat mission systems."

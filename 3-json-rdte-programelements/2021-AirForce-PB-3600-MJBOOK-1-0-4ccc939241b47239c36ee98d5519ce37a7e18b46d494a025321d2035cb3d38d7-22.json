The 3DELRR system will provide multiple benefits and increased capabilities to the USAF and to the Joint Services: 1) Replace the aging USAF AN\/TPS-75 radar system, which is at the end of its service life and costly to maintain; 2) Detect and track highly maneuverable, small radar cross section air-breathing targets; 3) Mitigate reliability, operational availability, maintainability, transportability and sustainability issues, which plague the AN\/TPS-75 radar system; 4) Enable greater battlefield and battlespace awareness through its precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to control individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions and 5) Provide exchange of information to the United States Marine Corps, Navy, and Army via appropriate interfaces. \n\nThe Air Force conducted a radar market survey in 2019 and identified multiple production-ready alternatives capable of meeting or exceeding 3DELRR requirements at this time. In FY20, the Air Force re-designated 3DELRR as a Middle-Tier Acquisition rapid prototyping effort to demonstrate in FY20 the performance of production-ready systems for meeting 3DELRR requirements.\n\nBased upon the new strategy, the Air Force has removed program funding from fiscal years FY22-FY25 and will use the FY20 prototype capability demonstration results to inform the FY22 budget request.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The EMD contract was awarded 11 May 2017 to a single developer to complete the final design, build, integration and test of the 3DELRR system. \n\nDue to chronic technical challenges rooted in current EMD contractor's proposed TPS-81 design and subsequent schedule delays, the USAF began conclusion of the current EMD contract in January 2020. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) directed a Middle-Tier Acquisition rapid-prototyping approach to accelerate capability delivery, pursuant to FY16 NDAA Section 804 guidance.\n\nThe current 3DELRR strategy is to implement rapid-prototyping, conduct operational assessment demonstrations of viable production-ready alternatives in FY20, and select the best solution that meets 3DELRR requirements in order to make the initial production decision in FY21. This strategy has the potential to deliver capability to the field no later than FY24.\n\nTest activities planned for FY21 include but are not limited to rapid-prototyping, demonstration and tailored Developmental Integration Test.\n\nThe MDA for the 3DELRR program is the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition).

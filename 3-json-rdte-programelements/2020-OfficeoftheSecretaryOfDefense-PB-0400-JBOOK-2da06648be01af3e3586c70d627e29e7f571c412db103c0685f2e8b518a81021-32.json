NSIN seeks to develop deep partnerships between the Department of Defense (DoD) and non-traditional problem-solving partners to include students and faculty at colleges and universities.

Mitigating these challenges require developing internal workforce and organizational competencies related to problem framing, knowledge and resource sharing, and non-traditional partnerships.  Consistent with the National Defense Strategy, and FY 2020 OMB\/OSTP research and development budget priorities for sustaining a military technological advantage, NSIN has a portfolio of innovation efforts that (1) accelerates capability development leveraging non-traditional collaborators and novel approaches, (2) augments the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) through commercialization of DoD lab technology, and (3) enhances the DoD workforce through programs that develop new ways of solving critical problems. \n\nThis program seeks to maintain the long-term competitive advantage for the U.S. military over adversaries by increasing interactions between uniformed and civilian employees of the DoD with innovators and entrepreneurs outside of the DoD.  This is accomplished by providing training and tools to these DoD \u201cintrapreneurs\u201d enabling them to find new ways to identify, frame, and solve problems as well as opening avenues to implement the solutions they create.  Additionally, the programs executed create opportunities for external innovators and entrepreneurs to be exposed to DoD problems and demonstrate possible solutions.\n\nNSIN carries out its mission via three portfolios of effort: Service, Collaboration, and Acceleration.  The Service Portfolio is specifically designed to create new pathways to national security service for entrepreneurs and technologists that want to work with the DoD to solve problems in non-traditional ways.  Collaboration provides problem-solving and new ideation spaces or Maker Centers for warfighters, academia and early-stage ventures to collectively identify novel applications and concepts to DoD problem sets.

NDEP is executed by the STEM Development Office, under the Defense Laboratories Office within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)).  NDEP\u2019s portfolio includes the Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program, the Military Child Pilot Program (MCPP), STEM Education and Outreach, and the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP).  These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) increasing STEM proficiency in the Nation by enabling an increased capacity to address ever-changing future defense workforce needs; (2) shaping the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through programs and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts and coordinating STEM efforts in alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) identifying approaches for innovative solutions in support of the Nation's current and future defense challenges.\n\nNDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan, and the DoD Agency Strategic Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and hires the students, upon graduation, into DoD's workforce.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 2,400 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 1,350 have completed their academic pursuit and transitioned into DoD employment.  Approximately 1,100 have completed their service to the Department.  SMART ensures the Department has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission.\n\nThe MCPP enhances the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, authorized the establishment of this Pilot Program.\n\nSTEM Education and Outreach fosters conditions for activities to support and cultivate STEM talent with minds for innovation, diversity of thought, and the technical agility to sustain the Department\u2019s competitive edge.  In order to build a necessary workforce that brings in an expansion of ideas to solve national defense needs and challenges, the DoD recognizes the need for increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.  Initiatives include investing, promoting, and participating in national-level STEM programs and efforts as well as providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the Nation.\n\nThe DoD is constantly looking for innovative scientific and technological solutions to address current and future military requirements.  The MEEP will enhance existing or establish new education programs that support manufacturing engineering."

Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to the Department on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  Approximately 1,100 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD Service commitment, of which 74 percent of those participants are still employed by DoD.\n\nOversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in relevant hands-on research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.\n\nSince FY 2005, approximately 2,400 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2016, approximately 1,350 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.

Investments are made to promote participation in national-level STEM programs and initiatives and provide authentic hands-on experiences for students and teachers across the globe.  Specific initiatives include internships, scholarships, and mentorships through partnerships with industry to include FIRST Robotics, MATCHCOUNTS, and the Center for Excellence in Education\u2019s (CEE) \u201cRickover\u201d and Research Science Institute (RSI) programs.

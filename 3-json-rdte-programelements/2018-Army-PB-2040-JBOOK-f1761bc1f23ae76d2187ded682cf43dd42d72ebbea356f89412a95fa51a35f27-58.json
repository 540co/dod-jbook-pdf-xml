The program now includes a Limited User Test (LUT) (replacing the previously scheduled Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E)) in second quarter FY 2018.  The LUT will inform the Milestone C decision, scheduled in third quarter FY 2018.  The IOT&E is now scheduled for second quarter FY 2019, in lieu of the previously scheduled Follow-on Test and Evaluation.  These changes have no impact on the current EMD plan to complete all 48 missile flight tests prior to  February 2018, in support of Milestone C.\n\nThe FY 2018 $26.100 million funding increase is to address the above schedule changes."

As a result of hardware delays, the program office will now execute a Limited User Test (LUT) in 2018. The delay in contract award between Boeing and the Apache Project Office prevented the completion of a platform software update required to support IOT&E, which would provide the Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) capability required for seamless JAGM integration with the Apache platform.  The approved Milestone B Test & Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) specified that the program manager, in agreement with the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), could transition the IOT&E to a LUT, if required; and convert the planned and funded Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) event in FY 2019 to an IOT&E to support Full Materiel Release (FMR) and Full Rate Production (FRP) decisions.  These changes have no impact on the missile design, production timelines, Initial Operating Capability (IOC) date, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), or any key program event.  The same quantity of missiles will be available for each event with no schedule impact to milestones. Additionally, these funds will support integration with other platforms, as required.\n\nOn 17 March 2017, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) delegated Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to the Secretary of the Army.  Accordingly, the Acquisition Category (ACAT) designation for JAGM is now ACAT 1C."

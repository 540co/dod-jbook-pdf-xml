These efforts have enabled over 55 device types and 3,000 daily tracks to be supported by the MMC. A second line of effort provided sustainment and Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) support to SOCOM and Army Tagging, Tracking and Locating (TTL) programs. This included deliveries of new capabilities and devices that are enabled by the KeyMaker architecture hosted by the MMC for use by SOF, Army and Marine forces. In support of the KeyMaker Unclassified systems the J-FFT Testbed procured, tested and deployed a Force Tracking Cloud solution using the Amazon Web Services provider that reduced costs and improved performance. The J-FFT Testbed also satisfied FFT user requirements by executing capability development and test cycles for over a dozen JIIM user projects that included support to the Bold Quest 16.1 Coalition Capability Assessment, development of a new NATO FFT message standard (STANAG 5527) for coalition interoperability, FT support to the US Pacific Fleet \u201cRim of the Pacific\u201d (RIMPAC) exercise, and transition of the Simply Aware application supporting US Army Africa and a proof of concept to meet Army Movement Tracking System needs."

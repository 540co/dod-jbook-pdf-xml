            "val": "The Advanced Technology and Sensors (ATS) program coordinates the development of advanced technologies (sensors, data links, targeting support, and quick reaction capabilities) in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned. Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly transition advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for remotely piloted aircraft. This program coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The ATS program also increases interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.\n\nThe funds in this program are distributed in priority order for the goal of building a comprehensive Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and on the results of the Airborne Sensors for ISR Analysis of Alternatives, as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year.  The program office has the ability to rapidly initiate an Imaging & Targeting Support (I&TS) project in order to expedite development and acquisition of urgently needed capabilities for the warfighter.\n\nThe Air Force is pursuing a software intensive approach to maintain safe separation, avoid collisions, and provide the ability to safely integrate with other airspace users. The software solutions identified in this Information System Capability Development Document (IS-CDD) are open and modular and accept inputs from any type of sensor or data link and will operate any legacy and future Group 4 and 5 RPA. The effort includes technology maturation, risk reduction, EMD and life-cycle costs, such as: 1) prototyping activities, 2) streamlined development, test and implementation of the software, 3) development of open system architecture using modular design, standards-based interfaces, and widely-supported consensus-based standards, and 4) collaboration with the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other services to develop national policy and standards.\n\nFunds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Improved sensor performance includes but is not limited to: increased geolocation accuracy, increased dismount detection capability, and advanced sensor data correlation. New and improved sensor capabilities include but are not limited to: Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI), Polarimetric Imaging (PI), Ground and Dismount Moving target indicator (GMTI\/ DMTI), maritime search\/track, Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar, Foliage Penetration (FOPEN), and nuclear event detection. New and improved sensor modes include but are not limited to: high resolution imagery, Ground and Dismount Moving Target Indicator (GMTI\/DMTI), persistent surveillance, wide area motion imagery, and Spectral Identification. New and unique sensor modalities include but are not limited to: low frequency SAR, Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI), and Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR). Enabling Technologies include but are not limited to: automated and assisted target detection\/recognition, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), network centric warfare, integrated multi-sensor capabilities to detect and identify obscured targets, TCPED (Tasking, Collection, Planning, Exploitation, and Dissemination) improvements related to sensors, automated registration, and imagery product quality assurance.\n\nThese efforts are intended to accelerate delivery of data from sensor to user for both target search and target engagement (kill-chain) activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing and advancing common standards (e.g. Open Mission Systems (OMS), Sensor Open System Architecture (SOSA), Common Open Architecture Radar Programs (COARPS), Multi-INT Common Open Architecture Reconnaissance Program Standard (MI-COARPS), National Imagery Transmission Format, AgilePod and data reduction) and interfaces.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

The software solutions identified in this Information System Capability Development Document (IS-CDD) are open and modular and accept inputs from any type of sensor or data link and will operate any legacy and future Group 4 and 5 RPA. The effort includes technology maturation, risk reduction, EMD and life-cycle costs, such as: 1) prototyping activities, 2) streamlined development, test and implementation of the software, 3) development of open system architecture using modular design, standards-based interfaces, and widely-supported consensus-based standards, and 4) collaboration with the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other services to develop national policy and standards.\n\nThe program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

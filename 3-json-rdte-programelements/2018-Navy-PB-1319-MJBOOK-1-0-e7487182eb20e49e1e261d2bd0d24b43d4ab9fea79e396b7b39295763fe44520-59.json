            "val": "Initial and continuing development of strike weapons consisting of armament, munitions, and weapon subsystems to allow for the horizontal integration among current and future weapon system capabilities to provide enhanced anti-surface and land strike capabilities in a demanding Anti-Access Area-Denial environment.  This program provides for the development of weapon and weapon system technologies to address future requirements for enhanced and alternative weapon system capability requirements that include selectable output weapons, low collateral damage weapons, precision lethality weapons, area weapons, alternative warhead technology, Insenstive Munitions (IM), scaled munitions, Department of Defense (DoD) fuzing systems, sensors, extended range weapons and precision guided training round technology.\n\nThe Precision Strike Weapons Development Program Element (PE) supports the Next Generation Strike Capability (NGSC) by funding Next Generation Land Attack Weapon (NGLAW); a surface\/submarine fired survivable, long range, multi-mission, multi-platform conventional strike capability fielding in the FY 2028 - FY 2030 timeframe.  The Next Generation Strike Capability (NGSC) strategy will address future threats in time to replace or update legacy weapons while bringing next generation technology to Department of the Navy (DON) standoff conventional strike (Land Attack & ASuW).  Within NGSC, NGLAW will be capable of attacking land and maritime, stationary and mobile targets while supporting two of the Navy's primary mission areas: 'Power Projection' (land attack from the sea\/undersea) and 'Sea Control' against enemy surface action groups\/combatants. To the maximum extent possible, NGSC will utilize common components and component technologies (e.g. navigation; communications; seeker; guidance and control) across the air-launched and sea-launched missile variants to reduce cost, shorten development timelines, and promote interoperability. \n\nThe Precision Strike Weapons Development Program Element (PE) supports the air-launched electronic warfare (EW) systems capability; through the integration of a Navy variant of the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD).  EW is an integral war-fighting effect supporting combatant commander integrated priorities, as well as Joint or Coalition operations.  EW systems influence, deceive, disrupt, degrade, deny and destroy threats throughout the electromagnetic spectrum to airborne and air-launched systems and their operations.  EW includes air-launched electronic attack (EA) as well as elements of electronic support (ES) and electronic protection (EP).  EA provides self-protection capabilities to other weapon systems through active and passive measures that deceive threats to airborne and air-launched systems and their operations by using kinetic and non-kinetic means to defeat threats that rely on the electromagnetic spectrum (Radio Frequency (RF), Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR).  The ES capabilities support the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information related to the detection, geo-location, characterization, and identification of threats to airborne and air-launched systems and their operations.  An air-launched EW system with stand-in capability increases the range and duration of EW systems while providing flexibility to commanders for employment.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under ADVANCED COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPES because it includes all efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

A Navy variant of MALD with stand-in capability increases the range and duration of EW systems while providing flexibility to commanders for employment. To the maximum extent possible, the Navy will utilize existing technology from the current MALD-J production line and other common components (e.g. navigation, communication, guidance and control, payload) to reduce cost, shorten development timelines and promote interoperability. OPNAV has written a draft CDD in preparation for entry into formal staffing in 4Q17."

FY 2018 will transition MALD from a Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) Demonstration to a Navy program of record.  The Navy program builds upon the SCO demonstration, which allows the Navy to begin integration, development and mission planning activities in FY 2018.  Tasks scheduled to begin in FY 2018 include but are not limited to: Aircraft Integration\/Air Worthiness to include wind tunnel testing and fit checks specific to F\/A-18 E\/F; software development of a MALD mission planning module hosted into Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and a Navy MALD unique \"Airborne Electronic Attack\" planning module and material purchases to support developmental activities.  Material purchases in FY 2018 support base plan activities. Long lead material procurements in FY 2018 support continued development and aircraft integration work and have an 18 month lead time for some AUR components and up to a 24 month lead time for  Range Safety\/Flight Termination Systems.  Funding also provides for Engineering, Logistics and Program Management support.  This is not a new start."

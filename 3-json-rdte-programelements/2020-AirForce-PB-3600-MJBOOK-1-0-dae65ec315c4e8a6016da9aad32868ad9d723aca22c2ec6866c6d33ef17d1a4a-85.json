            "val": "The Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) strategy is to evolve current and future Protected MILSATCOM systems, sustain the existing AEHF system capability and develop a more affordable and resilient MILSATCOM enterprise capable of meeting near term and emerging MILSATCOM requirements. A significant thrust for this initiative is to demonstrate technologies and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) that lead to a future Protected Anti-Jam Tactical SATCOM (PATS) capability that\nprovides tactical-level MILSATCOM users protected, anti-jam satellite communications while operating in a contested environment. PATS will provide tactical users significantly higher data rates than AEHF and a security architecture that enables forward deployed users to have protected satellite communications in scenarios where AEHF terminals cannot be deployed. Under this construct the SMI will: 1) Reduce parts\/obsolescence risk to AEHF space vehicles, 2) Continue the Capabilities Insertion Program (CIP) to enhance the current AEHF constellation and Protected Communications performance, and improve system operational resiliency, and 3) Invest in technologies and demonstrations (e.g. Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration) that enable the future Protected Tactical Enterprise Service and SATCOM programs by continued development of the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) technologies, maturing the Protected Tactical Testbed, and demonstrating resilient and affordable wideband protected technologies and CONOPS.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $5.388 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Advanced EHF MILSATCOM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

A significant thrust for this initiative is to demonstrate technologies and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) that lead to a future Protected Anti-Jam Tactical SATCOM (PATS) capability that provides tactical-level MILSATCOM users protected, anti-jam satellite communications while operating in a contested environment.  PATS will provide tactical users significantly higher data rates than AEHF and a security architecture that enables forward deployed users to have protected satellite communications in scenarios where AEHF terminals cannot be deployed.  Under this construct the SMI will:  1) Reduce parts\/obsolescence risk to AEHF space vehicles, 2) Continue the Capabilities Insertion Program (CIP) to enhance the AEHF constellation and Protected Communication performance and improve mission operational resiliency and 3) Invest in technologies and demonstrations (e.g., Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration or PTSFD) that enable the future Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) and SATCOM programs by continued development of the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) technologies, development of PTW enabled modems, maturing the Protected Tactical Testbed, and demonstrating resilient and affordable wideband protected technologies and CONOPS."

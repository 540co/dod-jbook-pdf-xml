Improvements are sought across the entire multi-spectral range from visual through infrared (IR) and millimeter wavelengths (MMW) radar for incorporation into self-protection using sustained generated obscuration technology.  SOM will be man portable and modular to facilitate quick mounting on manned\/unmanned platforms and dismounted operations.\n\nNBCRV:  This program upgrades the Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS).  The NBCRVSS is the Mission Equipment Package for the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) and consists of chemical point detectors, a standoff chemical vapor detector, a biological point detector, a Chemical Vapor Sampling System, and a Sensor Processing Group.  The NBCRVSS provides the Stryker NBCRV the ability to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) Hazards. Starting in FY16, a Chemical Surface Detector will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuverability of the Stryker NBCRV and increase reliability. Starting in FY17, a Chemical Mass Spectrometer will be developed to replace the Chemical Biological Mass Spectrometer Block II to increase reliability, sensitivity, and the number of chemicals detected. Also in FY17 an update to the Joint Service Lightweight Standoff Chemical Agent Detector (JSLSCAD) will be developed to increase range and probability of detection by reducing its field of view. FY18 funds and program details are reflected under PE 655038, Project Code EQ7."

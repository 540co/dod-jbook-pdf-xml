The T&E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team's State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time.\n\nThe T&E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity. In FY 2016, T&E FT performed twelve (12) DCGS Enterprise assessments.  This trend is expected to continue in FY2017. Of the six DCGS PoR systems, two hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, & Computers\/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases. One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending. Of the three remaining PoRs, two are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events. Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year.\n\nIn FY 2016, T&E FT conducted twelve (12) DCGS Enterprise assessments.\n\nIn FY 2017, T&E FT will perform a minimum of ten (10) DCGS Enterprise assessments.\n\nIn FY 2018, T&E FT will perform a minimum of nine (9) DCGS Enterprise assessments."

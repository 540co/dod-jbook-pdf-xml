This effort also provides technical expertise, programmatic guidance, and policy navigation that supports AF approved application rationalization processes to multiple hosting environments and enterprise IT Lifecycle Capabilities Integration Environment (CIE) testing of CCE services.  \n\nThe FY2020 funding request was reduced by $6.991 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapons system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

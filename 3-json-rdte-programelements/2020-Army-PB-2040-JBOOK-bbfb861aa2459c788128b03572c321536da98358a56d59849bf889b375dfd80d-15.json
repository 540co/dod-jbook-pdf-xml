This PE matures both countermeasures (CM) and counter-countermeasures (CCM) to deny the enemy the use of their systems while protecting United States (U.S.) assets from enemy deception and jamming. Project CY3 matures and demonstrates architecture, sensor and software techniques to provide operationally relevant capabilities for cyber support at Corps level and below and enables cyber situational awareness, command and control, mission rehearsal, observable reporting, and framework to incrementally advance cyber tool development. Project K15 matures and demonstrates capabilities to locate and exploit enemy communication systems including computer networks. Project K16 matures and demonstrates multifunctional EW capabilities (jamming) to enhance platform survivability and provide near real-time situational awareness to the Commander through the detection, identification and geo-location of emitters of interest.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology), and is coordinated with PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

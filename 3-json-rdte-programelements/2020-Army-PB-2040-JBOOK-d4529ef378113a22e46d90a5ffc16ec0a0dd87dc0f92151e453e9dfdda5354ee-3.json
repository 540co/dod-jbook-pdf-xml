The network provides resiliency through path diversity and dynamic routing to ensure tactical units can communicate in hostile environments. It fully incorporates cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.\n\nJBC-P also supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 2, Common Operating Environment by utilizing:\n- Interoperable data, message, and waveforms\n- Integration with Joint C4ISR and strike capabilities\n- Sensors and applications that enable operations across domains\n\nThe Joint Battle Command - Platform program is the cornerstone of Joint Forces Command and Control (C2) Situational Awareness (SA) and communications. JBC-P includes a network which enables the movement of data and provides secure Blue Force Tracking (BFT) capability in Platforms and Command Posts, providing soldiers and commanders a map-based Common Operating Picture of the battlefield, as a result, reducing fratricide.\n\nPdM JBC-P, under PM Mission Command (MC), is collaborating with the Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center's (CERDEC) Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) on evolving the BFT network. Systems engineering studies\/planning activities are underway to develop the evolution path of the BFT network, and the introduction of a Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA). In addition, there are two RDT&E contractual efforts underway for FY 2018 (assess the feasibility of reusing existing BFT-2 transceivers (hardware) and replacing it third party or government owned waveforms), and FY 2019 (assess the feasibility of introducing BFT network resiliency components to existing BFT network). The goal is for all the R&D & experimentation efforts mentioned above, to inform a BFT-3 full and open solicitation (RFP) to industry FY 2020.  \n\nJBC-P RDT&E resources are used to improve JBC-P hardware, network performance and add network resiliency while Mounted Computer Environment RDT&E is used to improve and add software applications.\n\nTo better understand how potential changes to the BFT network would affect overall operations, funding was increased in both FY 2017 and FY 2018 to assist PdM JBC-P to fully model the operational BFT network; S&TCD is working on developing a model of the current BFT-2 waveform to test in the BFT portion of their Network Test Lab. This Test Lab provides the Government the ability to test proposed fixes, conduct regression testing of future Software and Firmware releases, and replicate any problems the system may experience without impacting the operational network.\n\nFORSCOM users have identified a need for an expeditionary JBC-P capability to better connect the Lower Tactical Internet (LTI) to the BFT network when dismounted; there is an RDT&E contractual effort underway for FY 2019 to develop a reduced Size Weight and Power (SWaP) dismounted BFT transceiver. PdM JBC-P has partnered with CERDEC's Command, Power and Integration Directorate to develope this capability, along with new power solutions."

The IOT&E tested the JBC-P system software on existing FBCB2 hardware (non-dismountable vehicle systems) and future production-representative hardware. On completion of Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Interoperability Test Certification (JITC), MDA authorized Full Rate Production (FRP) in 1st Quarter FY 2014. First unit equipped (FUE) was successfully conducted 3rd Quarter FY 2015.\n\nDevelopmental efforts are being performed through intra-government collaboration. System engineering efforts are being performed by CERDEC's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD); Command, Power and Integration (CP&I) & the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD). The goal is for all R&D & experimentation efforts to inform a BFT-3 full and open solicitation (RFP) to industry FY 2020.  Hardware along with fielding, training and field support efforts are obtained through existing competitively awarded contracts."

Harpoon Block II+ is a Network Enabled, Air-Launched, Anti-ship Cruise missile with the ability to receive in-flight targeting updates, improving target selectivity and the engagement of moving maritime targets.  Additionally, the system utilizes the Global Positioning System to provide in-flight updates coupled with an active radar seeker for accurate targeting. The program procurement budget keeps pace with evolving enemy threats by providing a network enabled, anti-ship cruise missile capability, which compliments the attributes of associated launch platforms.   The survivability of the HII+ is increased over the HIC due to the upgrade retrofit kit, increasing the lethality of the weapon system.

The upgrade will build upon achievements gained via SBIR N102-131 (Phases I and II) to develop the new seeker manufacturing process to convert old analog 3700-3 seekers to new 3700-4+ digital seekers. Developmental engineering and production assets will be procured by a sole source Cost-Plus Incentive Fee contract.  Non-recurring engineering and production options will be priced separately.\n\nThe Encapsulated Harpoon Block IC (ENCAP HIC) Reconstitution Program will refurbish and recertify 60 existing ENCAP HICs to an as-new war-ready material condition.  Coordinated contracting efforts between NAVAIR and NAVSEA offices will reintegrate and supply ENCAP HICs.  Vendor support for all associated activates will leverage existing vendor relationships, and exiting contracts when able.  All required manufacturing processes, support facilities, and tooling currently exist and are in current use for this program."

            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program funds the advanced technology development needed to achieve a responsive, efficient domestic industrial base that meets the warfighters' needs in an affordable and timely manner.  The ManTech program works with DLA\u2019s diverse supply chains to improve manufacturing capability throughout a product's life cycle.  It provides the crucial link between invention and application by maturing, scaling up, and validating advanced manufacturing technology in \u201creal world\u201d environments.  ManTech developments provide a path to low-risk technology implementation for many small businesses and defense unique suppliers as well as depots and shipyards that are critical to DLA.  By anticipating and addressing production and sustainment problems before they occur, readiness levels increase and sustainment costs are lower.  \n\nDLA ManTech is aligned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (IIBM); 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply (MVSS); and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information (ITLI).  \n\n\u2022 The IIBM SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products.  This SFA has supply chain focused execution portfolios for food (Subsistence Network), Castings (Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Advanced Casting Technology), Forgings (Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Forging Advance System Technology), Batteries (Battery Network) and Additive Manufacturing.\n\n\u2022 MVSS includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements without relying on foreign sources for microcircuits.  This strategic focus area mitigates supply issues caused by the lack of a reliable domestic manufacturing capability to produce products or raw materials needed to build and maintain weapon systems.  The major focus of the program is maintaining a reliable, trusted, domestic source for \u201cnon-procurable\u201d linear and digital microcircuits.  Microcircuit emulation allows the Services to save significant costs by using form, fit and functionally equivalent spare parts rather than redesigning the next-higher-assembly.\n\n\u2022 The ITLI SFA includes efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA, the Military Services, DLA industry partners and DLA customers.  It includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) programs.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging \u201cModel Based Enterprise\u201d paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected up and down the supply chain and across all DLA Customers and suppliers.  A major focus is to transform DoD engineering data from two-dimensional paper-based products to three-dimensional computer based models, and to develop processes to move from \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF files) to technical data files that can interface directly with industries\u2019 engineering systems. The benefits include shorter product introduction cycles, lower set up-costs for parts production and more economical small batch production.\n\nDLA\u2019s focus for this budget cycle highlights advanced capabilities in digital and technical data modernization, management and analytics to fulfill the DLA role in the DOD Digital Engineering Strategy and improve sharing of data with the industrial base and supported organizations. Investment explores technologies to lower the Agency\u2019s material acquisition and operations costs and improve weapons systems support.  This effort spans across both DLA R&D Program Elements and multiple Strategic Focus Areas, impacting across the DOD Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel and DLA Enterprise logistics processes."

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable customer wait times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This SFA includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings\/Forging programs and Additive Manufacturing programs. \n\nThe Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is the successor to the Combat Rations Network R&D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain.  The program's expanded areas of interest include: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security.  SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies.  Desired outcomes include: reduced cost, increased efficiencies, improved processes, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.\n\nThe Casting program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic casting industrial base supporting the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The casting program works with industry, universities, and the Casting Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation\u2019s foundry industry.  The program aligns projects with strategic issues and identified focus areas within the DLA and DoD. Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the casting industry.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks that focus on developing new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented, most often in conjunction with the casting industry associations.  These advancements improve the metal casting supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DoD weapon systems.\n\nThe Forging program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic forging industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Working with industry, universities, and the Forging Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation\u2019s forging industry.  The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas identified within the DLA and DoD.  Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the forging industry.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Number (NSN) Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the forging industry associations.  These advancements improve the forging supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DoD weapon systems.\n\nThe Battery Network (BATTNET) program objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy.  BATTNET conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for specific groups of batteries.  BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of Service approved batteries.  Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) program objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA is pursing all AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.  The AM effort pursues alternate means of supply for products that are otherwise non-procurable or susceptible to procurement issues due to an unresponsive manufacturing vendor base.  The AM effort includes the identification of AM candidates among the population of products that are needed but hard to obtain, costly or have long manufacturing lead times.  The AM effort requires management of 3D digital technical and manufacturing data. In addition, the AM effort includes the development of the processes that will tie the designers, engineers, maintainers, logisticians, procurement managers and the vendor base into a seamless AM procurement stream. Potential benefits include products that can address an unfulfilled Warfighter readiness need by reducing production lead times, production costs, storage costs, transportation costs and in some cases fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. DLA R&D will leverage these efforts with Industry, Academia and ongoing Military Service-level agreements (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Department of Energy."

The program has several projects addressing specific classes of obsolescent microcircuit technologies.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY2020 and beyond.

This SFA includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST), the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR), and the Emergent Manufacturing Technology (EMT) portfolios within its scope. \n\nThe Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) program\u2019s focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations for DoD to establish a \u201cknowledge-based approach\u201d to define, communicate, and collaborate on military unique combat uniforms and individual equipment (CUIE) requirements.  DLA has the responsibility to manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders.  The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly shorten the time needed to transition Combat Uniforms and Individual Equipment from development to operational use from years to months.  The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military CUIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based manual environment, into a knowledge-based automated environment.  The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end-to-end supply chain.\n\nThe Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program researches core technology to improve the quality, security, and interoperability of logistics data acquisition and management to enable and streamline DLA operations.  DLA enables transformation of business practices and methodologies as the data for weapons systems evolve from traditional formats and delivery methods (such as two-dimensional images and PDF formats) to newer, more innovative methods (such as three-dimensional solid models, object-oriented databases, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web 3C standards).  This transformational shift for DLA is driven by the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) approach, the way industry is delivering design and development data for weapon systems to the Military Services and the way the Military Services in turn manage and provide the data to DLA. DLA Logistics Operations, DLA Acquisition, DLA Tech\/Quality, and DLA\u2019s Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs) are key stakeholders in the DLIR initiatives to modernize the representation and delivery of weapons systems data.  \n\nThe EMT program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems."

Building on MUST I results, the MUST II objective is to complete tech data modernization for the MUST Knowledge base and to extend its impact across the C&T industrial base.  \n\nThe Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program will continue the Connecting the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) project and begin efforts to improve the Federal Catalog in combination with 3D Scanning capabilities.  This project would define the requirements and develop the prototype of the next generation of the federal catalog, including advanced search functions, geometric data representation, and autonomous data validation.  An enhanced catalog would promote the digital twin, i.e., the digital representation of systems and their components, and the use of digital artifacts to design, test and sustain national defense systems.  These capabilities could significantly improve DLA and DOD operations in acquisition, quality control, customer support, and other areas.  Additionally, the DLIR program will continue efforts to collaborate and develop a cyber-physical model that will evaluate the resiliency of OT systems after a cyber-attack and continue to support DLA\u2019s Technical Data Management Transformation (TDMT) efforts.\n\nThe EMT program continues to enable DLA's investigation of new disruptive technology advances that may be implemented in the nearer term, without degrading well established program efforts.  This program enables the Agency to advance those technologies sooner in order to provide to the warfighter earlier.  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase III efforts (which cannot be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging magnetic braking technologies, and addressing strategic materials shortage\/risk.  Efforts will continue in FY2020 to advance Digital Manufacturing by developing a comprehensive approach to take advantage of integrated, computer-based systems of simulation, three-dimensional (3D) visualization, analytics and various collaboration tools to create and manufacture products to support the warfighter.  Additionally, any emergent Strategic Materials requirements will be addressed through the EMT program. EMT baseline was reduced by approximately $0.353 million resulting from overall MANTECH $3.020 million in directed reductions. Impact of the baseline reduction will result in limited availability of funds for emergent technology requirements in execution years."

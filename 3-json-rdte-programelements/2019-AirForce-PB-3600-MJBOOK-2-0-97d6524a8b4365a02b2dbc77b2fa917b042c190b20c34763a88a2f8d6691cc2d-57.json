            "val": "AF Defensive Cyberspace Operations (AF DCO) provides defensive cyber capabilities that protect the AFNET and DoD network enclaves, to include their associated computer systems, software applications and sensitive operational information against unauthorized intrusion, corruption, and\/or destruction. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition,\nattribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.\n\nFirestarter utilizes cyber and Information Assurance (IA) technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various government research laboratories, to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Command's Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber\ntechnology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide IA & Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and\ndefensive cyberspace needs\/requirements.\n\nCyberspace Vulnerability Assessment\/ Hunter Team (CVA\/H) weapon system develops new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats. The CVA\/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access. CVA\/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks & systems. Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance. The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.\n\nCyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and\/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-mail Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace\nweapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations. CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.\n\nAF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system and is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks. ACD supports Air Force and Combatant Commanders by conducting synchronized Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and providing 24\/7\/365 monitoring and defense of USAF and US Central Command Secure\/Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET\/NIPRNET) systems against hostile attack. Daily intrusions to the AF network are analyzed in a forensics manner to identify a multitude of counter defensive and defensive tools and techniques that are required to truly strengthen cyber security. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and other Federal R&D entities often have cutting edge solutions, that, with 3600 funding, can be taken to the technology readiness level (TRL) needed for rapid deployment as new capability to counter critical cyber weapon system vulnerabilities. AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.\n\nActivities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required\nto manage, execute, and deliver Air Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance & situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs\/requirements.\n\nFirestarter utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various government research laboratories, to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Command's Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide Information Assurance (IA) & Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions."

ACD supports Air Force and Combatant Commanders by conducting synchronized Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and providing 24\/7\/365 monitoring and defense of USAF and US Central Command Secure\/Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET\/NIPRNET) systems against hostile attack. Daily intrusions to the AF network are analyzed in a forensics manner to identify a multitude of counter defensive and defensive tools and techniques that are required to truly strengthen cyber security. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and other Federal R&D entities often have cutting edge solutions, that, with 3600 funding, take them to the technology readiness level (TRL) needed for rapid deployment as new capabilities to counter critical cyber weapon system vulnerabilities. AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF Cyber Defensive weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

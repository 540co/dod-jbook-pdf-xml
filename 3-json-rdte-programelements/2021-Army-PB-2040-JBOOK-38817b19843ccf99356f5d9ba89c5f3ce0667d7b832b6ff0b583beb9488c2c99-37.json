The service cyber components have established their own training environments, but do not have standardized capabilities or content. PCTE will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) cyber forces with a standardized training capability that utilizes shared content across the Services to include emulated network environments and has the ability to connect to other range environments.. The PCTE platform is aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment OUSD (A&S) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, \"Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations,\" dated 17 November 2015. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) was designated as the DoD Acquisition Lead for the PCTE and the program is directed by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1645.  With the JROC validation of the Information System - Capability Development Document (IS-CDD) on 4 November 2019, the PCTE program quickly achieved Milestone B on 6 December 2019.\n\nFY 2021 will focus on adding capability into the platform releases while updating to support increased automation, scalability, and usability. Planned updates include an Intel capability, enhanced After Action Review (AAR), and Platform Enterprise services to increase realism of the training environment. The planned updates also include automation to refine the build out of PCTE which decreases manual processes. The PCTE platform will obtain accreditation at the Top Secret (TS) level to serve the critical need of DoD Cyber Mission Force (CMF) users to train at the TS data classification level. Platform licensing will be scaled to support the full DoD CMF user base which has resulted in a shift in funding."

The current strategy leverages the use of existing cyber contracts and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) vehicles to provide specified capabilities that will be integrated into a cohesive training platform. The next step in the acquisition strategy is developing a long term contract vehicle that will continue enabling the PCTE platform to achieve scalability, optimization, innovation, and quality standards to meet the dynamic needs of the Cyber Mission Force (CMF) user base. The PM is in the process of awarding a Single Award Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (ID\/IQ) contract to serve PCTE as well as other cyber community customers called the Cyber Training, Readiness, Integration, Delivery, and Enterprise Technology (TRIDENT) contract in Q2FY2021. CYBER TRIDENT enables PCTE to provide iterative capability provided to the Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) in Capability Drops (CDs) that either improve or add features. These CDs will be based on requirements contained and further developed as part of the PCTE Information System - Capability Development Document (IS-CDD)."

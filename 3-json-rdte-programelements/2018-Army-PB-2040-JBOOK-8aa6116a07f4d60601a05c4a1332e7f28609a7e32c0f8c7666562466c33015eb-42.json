            "val": "Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 in accordance with the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8).\n\nThe Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify\/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. EMARSS will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT)."

EMARSS will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four EMARSS-S (SIGINT). \n\nThis funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full Motion Video (FMV); Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar \/ Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI) radar; Line-Of-Site (LOS) and Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. \n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2018 funding in the amount of $2.111 million provides LiDAR Enhancement and Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) and PED Sensor Engineering Support."

ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8).\n\nThis funding line supports non-recurring engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC), testing, and integration.  Funding provides for Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving International Standards. It also enhances aircraft communications, navigations and surveillance (CNS); aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) and the integration of the AISR mission equipment package (MEP) as well as obsolescence issues involved with the conversion of Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to the ARL-E Program of Record (POR)."

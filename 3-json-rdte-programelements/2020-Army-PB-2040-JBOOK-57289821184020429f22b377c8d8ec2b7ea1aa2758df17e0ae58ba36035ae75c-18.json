The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plans.  Work in this Program Element (PE) is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity.

In addition, several Analyses of Alternatives started in FY 2018 will continue to require analysis funding into FY 2019, to include Vehicle Protection Suite, Terrestrial Layer Intelligence Support for Multi-Domain Battle\/Joint Combined Army Maneuver, Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System, and Advanced Threat Detection System.

In FY21, PE 0605826F, Acq Workforce Global Power, Project 664127, Acq Workforce Direct, was transferred to PE 0605831F, Acq Workforce-Capability Integration, Project 665826, Acq Workforce Global Power as part of the consolidation of eight AFLCMC Acq Workforce PEs into two PEs which more accurately reflect their contribution to one of two outputs and capabilities: Acq Workforce\u2014Capability Integration and Acq Workforce\u2014Management HQ-R&D. The consolidation enables AFLCMC to better manage variability associated with attrition rates, hiring timelines, demographic changes, and Average Work Year Costs (AWYC) across the AFLCMC enterprise.  In addition, the consolidation will reduce the need for technical adjustments, ATRs, and\/or BTRs in the year of execution.  Finally, the consolidation provides greater flexibility to prevent potential hiring freezes and\/or reductions-in-force.  The consolidation maintains transparency associated with funding, authorizations, work years, and AWYC's due to the establishment of new Projects within the consolidated PE 0605831F Program."

The acquisition and product support workforce provides cutting edge weapon systems, sustainment capabilities, and is charged with providing management, tools, and technical and business capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs throughout their life cycle. The direct funded acquisition workforce funded in this program element will support all phases of acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel.  This program element supports both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

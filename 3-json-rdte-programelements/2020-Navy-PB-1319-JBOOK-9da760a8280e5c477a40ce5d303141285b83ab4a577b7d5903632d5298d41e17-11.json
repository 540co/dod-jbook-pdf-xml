            "val": "This Program Element (PE) funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element , as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea.\n\nThe activities described in this program element PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments."

The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas, and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats, including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and\/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar, or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector\/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth, acoustic communications links."

Research performed within Undersea Weaponry supports several Naval S&T Focus Areas including Power Projection & Integrated Defense, Assure Access to Maritime Battlespace, Autonomy & Unmanned Systems, and Power & Energy. Weapon technology focus areas include: Explosives and Warheads, Guidance and Control (G&C), Simulation Based Design, Propulsion, Power Sources, Supercavitation, and Counter Weapons\/Counter Measures. The ultimate goal of this activity is to provide revolutionary capabilities needed to fill Sea Shield and Sea Strike Warfighter Capability Gaps, to accommodate unique payload limitations through the development of modular and reduced sized undersea weapons based on common technology enablers (where possible), to provide improved platform pre-engagement positioning and fire-control solutions for effective weapon-to-target engagement, and provide countermeasures and counterweapons against current and next-generation undersea weapons."

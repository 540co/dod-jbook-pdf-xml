            "val": "The Fund for Innovative Results and Execution (FIRE) combines three industrial base programs focused on innovation, urgent needs and accelerated deployment.  The program element is inherited from the Title 10-directed Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program (Title 10 USC Section 2508.)  The other two programs formerly existed as congressional plus-ups, the Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF) and the National Security Technology Accelerator.  FIRE makes investments in manufacturing research and development that address any of the following areas:  1)Urgent production requirements and diminishing defense manufacturing sources and material shortages, and a sustainable defense design team base; 2) Model-based engineering and integrated computational materials engineering; and 3) New, innovative technologies being developed through public-private partnerships. The FIRE addresses strategic shortfalls especially surge production and diminishing sources and is intended to address these specific shortcomings by applying a broad range of tools to amplify interest from non-traditional suppliers and accelerate implementation via experimentation, demonstration and rapid transition.  FIRE projects will be structured with an enhanced focus on competition, timeliness, and transition to operation. \n\nThese FIRE projects will be chosen from documented industrial base issues in consultation with the Services and Agencies. Projects will address needs that span several Services and Agencies.  Buy-in and planning will be critical elements in terms of attracting interest to start a project and transiting from an innovative idea to reality.  Projects will require substantial pre-negotiated paths from problem identification through incorporation into a real product or system.\n\nCongressional guidance for industrial base investment often addresses urgency.  The FIRE program will pursue innovation in acquisition as well as technology.  There will be a special emphasis on reaching non-traditional suppliers as sources of innovation.  Non-traditional and under-utilized funding mechanisms, such as Other Transaction Authority (OTA), will be emphasized."

MIBP collaborates with the services and agencies in performing assessments under the 2505 program to identify elements of the industrial base where current spending on production and research is insufficient to keep critical capabilities viable.  While industrial base risks are mitigated primarily through the direct engagement of prime contractors, program managers and military departments, exceptional cases require a more direct defense-wide intervention strategy. This Defense-wide Fund for Innovative Results and Execution (FIRE) program element, directed by Title 10 USC Section 2508, provides the Department with that means.\n\nAll projects are evaluated for industrial base risk using fragility and criticality risk criteria, similar to the more familiar probability and consequence risk criteria.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific capability likely to be disrupted.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific capability difficult to replace if disrupted.  In addition to the gating criteria of fragility and criticality, additional factors for project selection include: \n\u2022\tAn identifiable path of transition to production with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term. \n\u2022\tThe capability is unlikely to be available in the absence of the proposed support.\n\u2022\tAnalysis showing that the project results in a positive return on investment.\n\nFIRE investments are focused on three broad industry groupings:  1) Missiles and Munitions, 2) Space, and 3) Other industrial base niches.  Priority is given to investments that cut across multiple platforms and services."

This is a defense-unique industrial base niche.  The project developed a new Solid Divert and Attitude Control Systems (SDACS) diverter valve with advanced structural insulators and high-temperature seals.   The primary purpose was preservation of design team capabilities for Solid Divert and Attitude Control Systems (SDACS).  Funding research to sustain DACS competition is a specifically stated Congressional concern.\n\nButanetriol (BT):  Completed work to develop a qualified domestic source for BT, a solid rocket propellant precursor chemical, precluding the necessity of procurement from a prohibited foreign source. Since 2008, DoD\u2019s projected requirements have shrunk to levels that made it uneconomical for domestic suppliers to develop BT production capability. IBAS funded a cost-sharing project with the new supplier to retrofit an existing Dihydrofuran reactor, modify pumping, plumbing, heat management and process controls to an existing reactor, relocate existing atmospheric storage tank for waste collection and modify the discharge filtering system of an existing reactor.\n\nElectronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD): Because of the decline in missile production, fuzes are experiencing a decline in production, making the industrial base very fragile.  Without intervention, loss of industry design and production expertise is expected for ESAD-based fuzes. ESADs are most commonly used in missile fuzing, but have applicability to some of the Department\u2019s most critical gun fired and air delivered munitions as well.  To improve the industrial base capability, IBAS is funding EASD design projects for cost reduction and commonality across multiple missile and munition end-products.  Phase I was initiated by contracting with three different suppliers to exercise their engineering capability, including the use of sub-tier suppliers and component technology, to develop lower cost, common architecture ESAD designs.  These three suppliers form the critical core of the US Industrial Base for fuzes overall.  Phase II is planned for award in FY 2017.  In this phase the work from Phase I will then be applied against a post milestone C munition which can benefit the most from an upgraded fuze capability. \n\nLow Energy Exploding Foil Initiators (LEEFI):  This fuze project was initiated to develop a backup manufacturing capability for LEEFIs.  LEEFIs are a critical subcomponent used in all Electronic Safe and Arm Devices ESADs.  The current production facility is the sole source for LEEFI fuzes used in a wide variety of DoD missile programs.  The ability to manufacture these specialized initiators at an alternate location eliminates the risk of a single point of failure that has the potential to hobble production on all missile programs simultaneously.\n\nThermal Batteries: Similar to the issue with fuzes, the decline in missile production has made the industrial base for thermal batteries very fragile.  Production is falling below minimum sustaining rates.  IBAS has initiated three projects for thermal battery technical improvements in battery materials and shelf life that will lower minimum sustaining rates:  improved material composition that will provide additional domestic suppliers, characterization of Thermal Battery shelf-life model to enhance production quality and sustainment (reducing costs and industrial base burden), and improved thin film production to broaden and improve the market."

Key carbon fibers for these applications are unique, essential (not readily substitutable) and proprietary to a single producer\/single factory in one foreign country (Japan).  This foreign, single point-of-failure source of supply, of materials critical to essentially all major high priority space programs, is vulnerable to many severe and long-lasting supply disruption risks (e.g., natural disaster, industrial accidents, future Asia conflicts, foreign government controls and higher foreign commercial market priorities.  Regarding the latter, U.S. program carbon fiber use typically represents a small fraction of total global demand.  Carbon fibers recently developed in the U.S. and commercialized for civilian applications are promising alternatives to imports.  They represent a competitive second source, a more assured supply, cost less, and reportedly perform equal to or better than imports.  Historically, U.S. government programs have relied on single foreign sourced legacy materials and funding is often not available in government programs to test and qualify alternative second sources.  FY 2016 IBAS funds will be used to test and qualify U.S. second sources of commercially available carbon fibers.  With strong cooperation from industry primes, lower tier and material suppliers -- a significant list of promising U.S. government qualification program opportunities are identified for FY 2016 execution (e.g., multiple satellites, missiles and \u201cother\u201d systems).  Planned IBAS projects represent low technology risks, have well defined and near-term program transition points and are low-cost relative to significant industry investments in new, domestically manufactured carbon fiber supplies."

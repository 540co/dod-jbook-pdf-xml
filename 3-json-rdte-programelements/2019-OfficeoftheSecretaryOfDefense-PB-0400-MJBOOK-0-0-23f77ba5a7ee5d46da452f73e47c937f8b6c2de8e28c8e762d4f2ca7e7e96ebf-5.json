            "val": "The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The LL Program supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The project funds ten technology project areas.  \n\nOf these, there are five core-technology areas:\n\u2022 Advanced Devices\n\u2022 Optical Systems and Technology\n\u2022 Information, Computation and Exploitation\n\u2022 Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technology\n\u2022 Cyber Security, Science and Engineering\n\nThere are four emerging-technology initiatives:\n\u2022 Advanced Materials and Processes\n\u2022 Quantum System Sciences\n\u2022 Biomedical Sciences and Technology\n\u2022 Autonomous Systems\n\nThere is one Integrated Systems technology area, which focuses on combining novel component-level technologies to create system-level technology solutions for important DoD problems. \n\nThese ten technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all DoD mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. The categories are selected in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)), are aligned with DoD Communities of Interest (CoI), and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The research in these categories adapts to solve emerging DoD problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual projects in each area are selected with the goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally.\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Technical Intelligence:\n\u2022 The Technical Intelligence Program provides global science and technology (S&T) awareness and context in order to assist the DoD decision-makers plan for an uncertain future. The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today\u2019s global S&T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW\/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow\u2019s future.  The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies."

Development of a small laser radar in FY 2018 will allow real-time 3D images on a small unmanned air vehicle. Microwave radars with multiple receivers have many advantages including multiple look angles, stealthy receivers, and higher resolution. Research with simultaneous microwave beams and optical beacons will explore techniques to overcome synchronization and coherent combining difficulties. The ability for wavelength agility will become as important in the optical domain as it is for microwave electronic warfare.

This system will continue to develop and test a robust and secure quantum network with applicability to a secure core network for the DoD. Quantum computing could have important implications for solving DoD problems that are intractable on classical computers. Multiple techniques for overcoming technical difficulties are being investigated. For example, advances in control and measurement of trapped ion and superconducting qubits will enable the development of noise correlation measurements and error correction techniques. These advances are a requirement for quantum computers. FY 2018 plans also include design of a fieldable, high-precision vector magnetometer based on advances in quantum magnetometry.

Research into novel approaches for computer hardware\/software design will guide the design and development of a fundamentally new computing system that is inherently secure and can ensure mission success even when compromised. This effort will be complemented by developing a data-centric approach to ensuring self-protection of data throughout storage, computation and transit. Research into cyber resilient approaches for mission assurance includes the development and implementation of a secure processing engine for autonomous systems, and the development and validation of an automated capability for contested environments where a host may be disabled or compromised. Other cyber efforts include further developing the capability to automatically generate effective cyber courses of action for evolving threat environments such as damage by an attacker after network penetration, securing small satellites against the growing threat of cyber-attack, and securing the ability to compute on private data without revealing it and demonstrating this capability for a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) application."

Efforts include cyber analysis; creation and demonstration of robust architectures that can operate through cyber-attacks; development of prototypes that demonstrate the practicality and value of new techniques for cryptography, cyber sensing, automated threat analysis and course of action selection, anti-tamper systems, and malicious code detection; demonstrations of the impact of cyber on traditional kinetic systems; quantitative, repeatable evaluation of these prototypes; and, where appropriate, deployment of prototype technology to national- and international-level exercises and DoD and intelligence community operations."

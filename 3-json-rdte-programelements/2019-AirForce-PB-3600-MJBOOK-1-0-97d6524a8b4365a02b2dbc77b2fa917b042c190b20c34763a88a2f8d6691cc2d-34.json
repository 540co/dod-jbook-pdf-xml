EPS-R will develop and acquire 1) two Extremely High Frequency (EHF) payloads, using Advanced EHF's eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform, on hosted spacecraft, 2) upgrades\/modifications to the existing Enhanced Polar System (EPS) Control and Planning Segment (CAPS) to provide command and control and XDR mission planning capability, and 3) upgrades\/modifications to the existing EPS gateway to provide connectivity between polar and midlatitude users through the Global Information Grid.\n\nThe EPS-R program is timed to prevent a gap in Arctic Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) coverage after EPS end of life.  To ensure polar MILSATCOM continuity beyond FY 2025, the DoD will begin funding activities to bridge the gap between the current EPS program and future protected systems being planned for the late 2020s.  The EPS-R program has examined performance, mission needs, schedules, and costs to avoid a mission gap.  EPS-R intends to host the payloads on a Space Norway bus, which is scheduled to launch in CY 2022.  EPS-R will reuse EPS Gateway and ground control elements to the greatest extent feasible.\n\nTo meet the warfighter requirements for protected tactical and strategic polar MILSATCOM, RDT&E funding is required to continue program office and other related support activities that may include, but are not limited to studies, technical analysis, architectural development, acquisition strategy development, system requirements and system trades analysis, risk reduction activities, technology maturation, System Engineering, Integration and Test of all polar MILSATCOM segments and hosted payloads.\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EPS-R capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment"

Upgraded capabilities may include Navy Command and Control integration, Weapons Integration, Heavy Fuel Engine, Laser Designator, Frequency Agile Communications Relay, Digital Common Data Link, and cyclic refresh of the Electro-Optical\/Infrared camera. RQ-21A BLACKJACK will also continue to expand its shipboard capability across new ship classes.\n  \nThis program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Additionally, PWS includes personnel to support global deployments performing deployment site preparation and activation, and provides facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations.  Other MDA wide costs include:  physical and technical security; civilian drug testing; audit readiness; the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program; legal services and settlements; travel and agency training; office, equipment, vehicle, and warehouse leases; utilities and base operations; data and unified communications support; supplies and maintenance; materiel and readiness and central property management of equipment; and similar operating expenses. PWS is allocated on a pro-rata basis across most Agency PEs and therefore fluctuates per PE by fiscal year based on the total Agency budget in that fiscal year."

            "val": "Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. FVL was established in 2009 by the Secretary of Defense to focus all Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift capabilities and technology development, as well as retaining long-term engineering capabilities. In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. In 2017, the FVL was identified as one of the Army's eight Cross Functional Team Pilots, derived from the six Chief of Staff, Army modernization priorities. The development and fielding of FVL will significantly improve vertical lift capabilities providing critical aviation support to the Joint warfighting community.  Increases in maneuverability, range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint can only be achieved through the FVL approach of developing a new aircraft design.  FVL will integrate advancements in technologies and design configurations balanced with appropriate trades to ensure affordability. \n\nPE 0603801A, Project B47, Future Vertical Lift funding provides for the development of a Capability Set 3 aircraft system within the FVL family of systems.  FVL Capability Set 3 aircraft will conduct Air Assault, Amphibious Assault, Urban Assault\/Security, Attack, Maritime Interdiction, Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Humanitarian Assistance\/Disaster Relief (HA\/DR), Tactical Resupply, Direct Action (DA), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations in support of Army, including Army Special Operations Command, Marine Corps and Joint forces.  The FVL Capability Set 3 platform will significantly increase speed, range, mobility, and payload over current US Army H-60 and US Marine Corps H-1 aircraft and provide Combatant Commanders with tactical capabilities at greatly increased operational and strategic distances.  The FVL Capability Set 3 Materiel Development Decision was approved in October 2016.  FY 2017 funding provided for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) modeling, simulation, and analysis.  FY 2018 funding completes development and execution of the AoA and begins acquisition planning and strategy development.  FY19 funding will support the completion of a Technical Readiness Assessment and acquisition planning and strategy development, systems engineering support to decompose the draft Capability Development Document (CDD), and the development of Milestone A documentation and Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Contract Requirements Package."

After a successful Source Selection Evaluation Board, the Army will award competitive TMRR contracts to complete preliminary design and risk reduction testing.  At the end of TMRR, and after a successful Milestone B Decision, the Army will award an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract to complete development and testing of the system before entering the Production and Deployment phase in the FY 2030 timeframe."

Specifically, this effort includes extending the MAPS architecture across a broader set of active survivability capabilities and increasing the portfolio of Modular APS Framework (MAF) compliant technologies. In addition, this project will enhance the government-developed controller subsystem for performance and integration effectiveness with high speed digital signal processing and embedded systems\/firmware\/software which will be required due to the expanded active defense suite of sensors (e.g., electro-optic, infrared, radio frequency, magnetic, acoustic), sensor fusion, and explore synthesizing sensor data beyond situational awareness to situational understanding with context that can greatly enhance operational effectiveness and vehicle survivability. The activities under this effort provide incremental growth for broader threat spectrum defeat relevant to vehicle protection systems and will be aligned to capability gaps for transition to the acquisition community."

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), that provides an open architecture to allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle. \n \nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command.\n\nWork is also coordinated with PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology)."

Data collection will involve both simulation and live collection. Simulation will provide a baseline to correctly collect, clean, and analyze data that meets the need for improving algorithms for both formation control and unmanned aerial vehicle map input for unmanned ground vehicle mobility. Live data will start with Surrogate platforms in local areas. This will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligent methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI\/ML techniques to mature and demonstrate intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for GPS. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to improve algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI\/ML techniques to optimize intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAV mapped areas. Data collected from air vehicle will be converted to maneuverable information for unmanned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go\/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command.\n\nThis Project is coordinated with PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology)."

Program efforts include, but are not limited to, the following projects: directed energy protective equipment; flight helmets and visors; oxygen breathing systems for aircrew; radios and locator beacons; support equipment; nuclear flash blindness protection; night vision devices; noise reduction devices; anti-gravity (anti-G) suits; flame resistant, retardant and blast\/ballistic protective gear; aircraft seating; impact protection equipment; flotation devices; parachutes; ejection seats; physiological monitoring devices and other aircrew\/life support\/ground crew systems required by the warfighter. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Life Support capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

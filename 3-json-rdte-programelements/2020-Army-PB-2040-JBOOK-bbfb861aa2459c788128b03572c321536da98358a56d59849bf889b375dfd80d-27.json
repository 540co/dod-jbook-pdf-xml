Project K70 pursues technologies that provide our Warfighters with a Common Operating Picture (COP) to enable increased situational understanding and combat overmatch. Specific areas of maturation and demonstration include technologies that integrate disparate sensor architectures, perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), enable passive long range target identification (ID), improve day\/night visualization systems, allow rapid wire area search, and facilitate augmented reality. Project K86 matures and validates airborne platform sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment, and deception. This Project provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots\/crew members independently to enhanced operations in day\/night\/adverse weather conditions.\n\nWork in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).\n\nAll FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

This effort matures sensing and processing approaches to improve pilotage in DVEs. This effort optimizes Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) imaging sensors capable of providing actionable imagery over a wide range of DVEs. This effort also demonstrates a distributed aperture sensing (DAS) approach in which sensing modules are placed around the airframe to enable 360 degree coverage and provide information on potential threats and obstacles for increased Situational Awareness (SA). The effort provides DVE-specific multimodal fusion techniques to leverage the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of multiple sensor modalities. Work in this effort is coordinated with DVE efforts in PE 060211A, Aviation Technology, Project 47A, and PE0603003A, Aviation Advanced Technology, Project 313."

Demonstrated synthetic vision scene rendering in a real-time environment and implemented advanced navigation and location algorithms such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and 3D feature matching to refine aircraft navigation\/location solutions. Finalized designs for real-time computing hardware and architectures to support flight test and experimentation.

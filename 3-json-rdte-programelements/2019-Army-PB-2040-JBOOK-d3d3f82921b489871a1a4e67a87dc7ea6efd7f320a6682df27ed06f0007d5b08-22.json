A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 2009.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.\n\nThe RDTE funded elements for GPS Denied, UGCS Improvements and Alternate Munition Integration addressed in this submission are planned for award on the\nGray Eagle Engineering Services contract as a Sub-Engineering Services Memorandum (SESM) task order, and as Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requisitions (MIPRs) to various other Government Agencies. The purpose of the SESMs is to mature the respective designs to a level that Engineering Change Requests (ECR) are submitted to the Government via the Configuration Control Board (CCB). Following successful completion of the SESM and CCB approval, a contract modification to retrofit and\/or cut-in the respective engineering change will be awarded on the appropriate Performance Based Logistics (PBL) or Production contract.  The RDTE funded element for GBSAA Block II addressed in this submission are planned for award on various contracts and MIPR actions to other government agencies."

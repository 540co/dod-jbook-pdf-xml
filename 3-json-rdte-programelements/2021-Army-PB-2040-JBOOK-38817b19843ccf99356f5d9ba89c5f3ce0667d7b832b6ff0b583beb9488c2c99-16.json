            "val": "The Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Prototyping effort will produce unmanned combat vehicle prototypes with the purpose of providing vehicles that Soldiers will use to develop new Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and new requirements for unmanned combat vehicles to support Army Modernization priorities. RCV efforts will be executed in three (3) phases focused on increasing the complexity of RCV soldier maneuvers and expanding prototype platform capability. These efforts provide the basis for the Army to make the decision to move forward with a Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitioning from Technology Demonstrations to a Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&S) development, initial prototype testing and iterative Soldier evaluations. This will stress the autonomy systems developed within the Science and Technology (S&T) base, assist the Next Generation Combat Vehicles Cross Functional Team (NGCV CFT) with refining RCV requirements, and develop the CONOPS and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for Manned \/ Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) in combat relevant missions.\n\nSoldier Robotics Systems for Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. Joint Capabilites Integration and Development System, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing\/transitioning technology. Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives\/Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation\/transition from S&T projects, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle and maneuver under their own power. \n\nThe Battery Modernization & Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier and reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just 3. Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.\n\nRobotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) RD improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing\/transitioning technology. Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives\/Letter of Sufficiency determinations, market research, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation\/transition from S&T projects, MDD, and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C.

This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. Research Development Technology Evaluation (RDTE) funds enable support to capability development of emerging systems currently including Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF),  Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV), Dismounted Engineer Mobility System (DEMS), and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP). Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision). RDTE Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems funding supports Leader Follower and ABV program transitions from Technology Demonstrations to Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&S) development and initial prototype testing. This will stress the autonomy systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations. Funding also supports the exploration and development of Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) Applique on additional systems (Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), and 915 truck fleets) beyond the Palletized Load System (PLS) and applique kits on existing Tactical Wheeled Vehicles."

The RCV surrogate platform build (Phase 1) was initiated in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 under 0604017A Robotics Development, Project FD9 Robotics Systems and will conclude in this project with test and demonstration. This project will finalize Phase 1's rapid prototype build of surrogate RCV platforms using existing robotized vehicles and conduct Soldier evaluations at the platoon level (4 RCVs) through MUM-T evaluations. In order to conduct larger scale MUM-T maneuvers and to continue to advance the autonomous performance of the robotic platforms, two additional platoons of RCVs will be built leveraging existing contractor unmanned platforms for a total of a company set (12) RCVs. The company of RCVs (Phase 2) will be used for a second round of Soldier experimentation building off of the platoon exercises and providing additional refinement of CONOPs\/TTPs.\n\nThe RCV Phase 3 prototyping will build off lessons learned in Phases 1 and 2 and develop and produce innovative, unmanned platforms that investigate different approaches to solving challenges and building on opportunities in Phases 1 and 2 to include looking at different weight class RCV platform and new modular mission payloads for RCV platforms. The intent is to award a minimum of two contracts to design and build up to a company set (12) RCV platforms for user evaluation and experimentation starting at the end of FY 2024. The  RCV platforms will incorporate mature technology capabilities transitioned from S&T as they become available to include the latest autonomous mobility capability, improved user control interfaces and advanced sensing and aided target recognition. The Phase 3 RCV platform requirements will be informed by the initial platoon and company experimentation (Phase 1 and 2) and Soldier feedback."

Expand to include batteries for generators and hybrids, robotics, vehicles, and low density\/usage systems.  Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.\n\nFunding supports modernization of the current battery types.  Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts."

The first two phases will focus on surrogate RCV platforms to get armed unmanned systems into Soldier?s hands for experimentation as quickly as possible. Phase 1 delivers a platoon set of modified M113s with remote weapons stations in order to start to define how an RCV can augment combat capability and to help refine requirements based on user feedback for a follow-on purpose built RCV effort which will start in Phase 3.  Phase 2 adds an additional two platoons of surrogate RCVs to enable soldiers to execute company level maneuvers to better understand how RCVs will be used in the future fight and to refine software behaviors and control strategies of the RCVs.. Lessons learned from the phase 1 soldier experimentation will directly shape the requirements for the Phase 3 purpose built RCV effort which will competitively deliver up to a company set of RCVs through at least 2 industry partners for an extended Soldier evaluation.

It informs the acquisition process early in the development cycle allowing key stakeholders the ability to make integration decisions and affordability trades while writing requirements.\n\nProduct Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (PdM ALUGS) builds upon the CCDC GVSC Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) Operational Technology Demonstration (OTD) to provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to Tactical Wheeled Vehicles including the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1, Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV). Efforts include Capabilities Document input, close analysis of OTD activities that feed cost estimates, capture technical and test data, provide test support, develop Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capabilities, and develop a Software Integration Lab (SIL). Efforts may support Rapid prototyping to inform emerging programs and other Army systems. A \"buy\/lease, try and inform\" methodology may be used to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.\n  \nRobotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) funding supports Systems Engineering, Requirements, Cost Analysis, Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) support, and technology transition plans.  \n\nCombat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC) funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology.  The Army will build, and test prototype systems for safety release, Soldier use, and further technology maturation.  \n\nRobotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Experimental Unit Prototyping will provide unmanned combat vehicles to enable users to assess the capability of the platforms and created new CONOPS and doctrine for manned\/unmanned teaming based operations.  Efforts will inform new CONOPS, identified system limitations and benefits and provide an achievable, analytically backed basis for future RCV requirements documents to drive future acquisition programs."

DVD continues to develop the Risk Rating Tool (RRT) to focus data acquisition on individuals demonstrating high behaviors risk as identified by Machine Learning and Bayesian modeling. DVD will expand and test RRT models for the entire DoD population.\n\nin October of 2017 AAG tested both the commercial and government RRT models. The cross validation tested modeling strength correlation to known adjudicative revocation\/denial outcomes. Both models performed in the low-high 80% range of accuracy in identifying high risk populations in top 20% of scores. AAG also recommended additional validation to continue throughout the life cycle and risk-ranking modeling refinement be completed in a research environment to ensure the models continue to perform as required, are auditable, and protected status attributes are continually verified.  \n\nDVD will utilize these models Learning and statistics to identify individuals with high risk stressors mapped to the 13 Adjudicative guidelines. Use of these tools are projected to generate cost avoidance in data acquisition by focusing resources on high risks rather than a randomly selected process."

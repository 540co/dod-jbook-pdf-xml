            "val": "The Airworthiness Certification Program Element (PE) ensures safe flight operation of Army aircraft and aviation systems by means of technical design approval and qualification of systems to appropriate airworthiness standards. This PE provides independent airworthiness qualification for all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by Army Regulation (AR) 70-62 (\"Airworthiness of Aircraft Systems\"), and is essential for ensuring the safe operation of Army aircraft. This PE performs engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft, to include performing safety-of-flight investigations\/assessments, evaluating system risks, developing Airworthiness Impact Statements, developing Airworthiness Releases, and evaluating Safety of Flight Messages and Aviation Safety Action Messages for new and upgraded aircraft systems. This PE also provides: management\/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management\/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support for major development\/modification and future systems\/subsystems requirements of the Program Executive Officer for Aviation (PEO AVN) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command's Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO); and management of test and evaluation processes in support of the airworthiness qualification process. \n\nThe Airworthiness Certification PE also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models. Ongoing programs requiring airworthiness qualification include the following PEO Aviation and TAPO Future Force systems: Longbow Apache E-model; Chinook F-model; Blackhawk M-model; Special Operations MH-47G and MH-60M; Light Utility Helicopter; Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Enhanced Multi-sensor Airborne Reconnaissance and Sensor System (EMARSS); and modified Shadow UAS. Additionally, the Airworthiness Certification PE supports the application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including the following Aircraft Survivability Equipment: Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband avionics and Tactical Radio Systems and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker. \n\nFinally, this PE also provides: airworthiness certification for military-use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council, Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS)); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects (e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives."

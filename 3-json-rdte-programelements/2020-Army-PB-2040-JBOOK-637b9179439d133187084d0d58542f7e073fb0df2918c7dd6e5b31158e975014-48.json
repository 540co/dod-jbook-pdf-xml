            "val": "The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems\/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. \n\nJTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM), constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is used as an institutional trainer though is available as a deployable asset.  JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. \n\nThe JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  P3I Improvements upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and improves warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 is complete. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite delivering critical capabilities sooner. Phase 2, Spiral 1 delivers increased sensor capabilities to include, but not limited to processing SBIRS GEO satellite Staring sensor data and additional Highly Elliptical Orbit data. Spiral 2 delivers increased sensor access, communication upgrades, and enhanced training\/exercise capabilities (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing in accordance with the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2018-21).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible. Operational Need Statement (ONS) 18-22681 resulted in an Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) approval (13 Apr 18) for the fielding of JTAGS Block II systems, replacing the legacy JTAGS Block I systems. Fielding of the JTAGS Block II Phase 1 systems began in 2018 and is ongoing. Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)\/Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) are developing Capabilities Production Documents (CPDs) to address emerging threats that are already known and future requirements. JTAGS must stay concurrent with any future overhead persistent infrared sensor capabilities to remain relevant and retain resiliency of Teater Event System (TES). \n\nFY 2020 requested funding of $10.275 million will allow for the continued Spiral 3 software tuning efforts to fully exploit sensor data, evolving cyber hardening advances, emerging threats, and initial planning for 2021 Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOTE)."

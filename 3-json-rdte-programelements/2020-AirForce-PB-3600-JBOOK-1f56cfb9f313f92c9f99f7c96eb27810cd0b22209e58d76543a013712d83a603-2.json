This program provides and maintains the currency of Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment Desktop Training System.\n\nT-6 Operational System Development continues follow on development activities to JPATS including but not limited to studies & development efforts, instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources(DMS) and development activities related to DMS. Included is development for the Next Generation On-Board Oxygen Generation System, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out), Crash Survivable Recorder (CSR),Controlled Flight Into Terrain - Prevention (CFIT-Prevention), Pilot Training Next (PTN) and associated upgrades. There are currently 444 aircraft in the Air Force inventory. The aircraft were designed with a 24 year service life. Remaining service life is up to 16 years from the final delivery in May 2010.\n\nThe T-38 program continues studies & development efforts supporting future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to address DMS issues and the regular block upgrades required to keep the system current. Block upgrades incorporate software and\/or hardware improvements for the aircraft and aircrew training devices to address flight safety issues and to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, or National Airspace System.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Specialized Undergraduate Flight Training capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $0.659 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

URT produces RPA pilots and Sensor Operators from accession sources to man RPA squadrons. Success of the program is heavily dependent on Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System to prepare undergraduate students for entry in RPA Formal Training Units (FTU). PRIME has completed seven Phases of development and is now at baseline functionality. PRIME is a desktop trainer similar to the Reaper training system now in use to train undergraduate RPA pilots and sensor operators. PRIME currently emulates the MQ-9 Reaper and needs to keep pace with that baseline system and expand to other RPAs in order to maintain concurrency and relevancy. Funds will also be used to develop enhancements that increase fidelity and functionality.  Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources efforts include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver URT weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

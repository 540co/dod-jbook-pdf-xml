            "val": "The Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)) will be a man-packable, small (<25lbs), highly mobile, unmanned robotic system with advanced sensors\/mission modules for dismounted Service Members. The CRS(I) will be designed so operator can quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and\/or payloads.  The CRS(I) will also include the Army universal controller used by all unmanned ground and aerial vehicles within the battalion formation providing interoperability, logistics, and training efficiencies.  The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces.  This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the Operating Environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated War-fighting Force by providing standoff to the War fighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations.\n\nThe Robotics Enhanced Program (REP) uses a \"buy, try, and inform\" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness.  Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a Cost-Benefit Analysis to support future Army decision making.\n\nRobotics Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts.  It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interface, common software and universal controllers.  RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET), Leader\/Follower (LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System (RCIS), Common Robotics System-Vehicle (CRS(V)), CRS(I) Inc II, etc.) and new standards addressing emerging requirements (i.e. Cyber Security, Information Assurance, new payloads, etc).     \n\nRobotics Development (RD) includes efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, validate material solutions and determine initial Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in support of pre-Material Development Decision (MDD) activities for emerging requirements and programs of record. RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&T) projects, REP initiatives and\/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities.  This line is for robotic systems that are transported by individual Soldiers, by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. SMET, Leader\/Follower (LF), Route Clearance Interrogation Systems (RCIS),  CRS(V), CRS(I) Inc II, Soldier Born Sensors, etc) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support AoA that include Army Material Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND Corporatin studies, and\/or modeling to increase confidence in the material solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)\/Capability Production Document(CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations."

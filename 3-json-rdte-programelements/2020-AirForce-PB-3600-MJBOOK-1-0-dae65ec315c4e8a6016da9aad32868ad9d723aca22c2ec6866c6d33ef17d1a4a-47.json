This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities. The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to, and in conjunction with, the PSE RDT&E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG). As such this program will obtain, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG-funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG-developed PSE.  In support of PSE, this RDT&E program includes spectrum planning for radio frequency (RF), communication security (cyber), information assurance requirements, integration and interoperability command control & communication (3) platform & components.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection Commercial Off The Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control, power, mobility, and defeat effects) which are considered effective for AF physical security use. This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C 3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission. Force Protection programs are inherently subject to rapid changes in the operational environment and will retain sufficient Program flexibility to meet changes in location, scope and capability in order to protect Air Force people, facilities and warfighting assets.       \n\nCounter Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (Cs-UAS) Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) is a rapid acquisition and deployment capability existing of full kill (detect, track, assess and defeat with various capabilities (fixed, mobile, portable and hand-held.) It is a layered system-of-systems using COTS technologies, integrated via GOTS C2 system.\n\nCounter Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (Cs-UAS) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) supports EUCOM JUON to protect specific strategic assets in overseas theaters of operation from the evolution of small unmanned aerial systems based on low cost, extensive proliferation, and availability in the commercial marketplace. FY17 is Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. \n\nCounter Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (Cs-UAS) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON)in support of the Combined Joint Task Force - Operations INHERENT RESOLVE in CENTCOM.  This funding protects assets from the evolution of small UAS systems based on low cost, extensive proliferation and availability in the current market place.\n\nCounter Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (Cs-UAS) protection capabilities at downward selected high priority sites.\n\nCounter Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (Cs-UAS) protection capabilities for 7th Air Force Urgent Operational Need (UON)\n\nAir Base Ground Defense (ABGD) will support all Development testing, Evaluation, Integration, Certification, and proof of concept for Tactical Automated Security Systems (TASS) and other tactical\/expeditionary equipment that is required to provide robust force protection capabilities worldwide; flight-line security, aircraft, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets, critical infrastructure, sustained sortie generation and air operations, advanced technology force multipliers to include: night vision and thermal imagery equipment, counter sniper\/battery capabilities, ground weapons, target acquisition radar, inter operable tactical communications, [required C3 and protective standoff equipment for] wheeled tactical [non-tactical], armored [un-armored] vehicles, tactical sensors systems, integrated and interoperable command control & communication (3) platform & components, and unit\/personnel protective field equipment. Additionally, ABGD will support all Development testing, Evaluation, Integration, Certification, and proof of concept  for Technology Integration Management (TIM) and associated integration and interoperability efforts\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver these weapon system capabilities.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

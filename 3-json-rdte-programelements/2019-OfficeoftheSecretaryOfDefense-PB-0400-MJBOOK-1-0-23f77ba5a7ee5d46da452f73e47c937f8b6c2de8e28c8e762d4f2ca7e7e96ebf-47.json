Innovation is the rapid experimentation and development of existing technologies (hardware, software, licenses, databases, analytics, etc.) to create new capabilities and demonstrate their intelligence value in support of warfighter operations.\n\nBeginning in FY 2019, ICI also funds Project Maven which fields increasing amounts of automation to Full Motion Video (FMV) ground exploitation stations for Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude and High Altitude ISR platforms. Maven uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon). Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts  can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from GEOINT. Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform)."

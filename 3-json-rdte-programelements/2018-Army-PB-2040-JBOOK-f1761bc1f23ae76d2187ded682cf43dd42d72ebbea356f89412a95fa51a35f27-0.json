            "val": "The Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 budget request funds the development of Aircraft Avionics systems required to horizontally and vertically integrate the battlefield and the integration of those systems into Army aircraft. Tasks in this Program Element support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.\n\nThe Airborne Maritime Fixed-Aviation (AMF-A) is the transformational system that provides Army Aviation interoperability capability for Future Force and Joint Force operations.  The AMF-A integration effort provides for the non-recurring engineering required to integrate and qualify the AMF-A certified radios with Link 16 and\/or other advanced networking waveforms into the Apache AH-64E and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  Specifically, the PRC-152A radio will be incorporated into the Shadow UAS Communications Relay Payload mission equipment package.\n \nThe Doppler Global Positioning System Navigation Set (DGNS) Upgrade program completes system engineering trade studies to reduce space, weight, and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as inertial sensor, MIL-STD-1553 interface card, and Instrument Flight Rules map display.  It also prepares Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to the existing DGNS ASN-128D Line Replaceable Units (LRU) as a result of those trade studies.  The DGNS upgrade continues with execution of Non-Recurring Engineering for Computer Display Unit (CDU) and Signal Data Converter LRU ECP packages.  The ASN-128D CDU upgrade replaces the current CDU faceplate with a touch screen display, provides a moving navigation map capability and optimizes pilot interface to augment existing Instrument Flight Rules capability promoting safer flight operations.  The CDU upgrade will support Assured-Position Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) operations in conjunction with additional system LRU upgrades, includes anti-jam antenna capabilities, and supports Department of Defense (DoD) and Army's requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations.  This will require assessment and follow-on upgrade to the DGNS navigation system.  The CDU upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance and associated PNT capability gaps, and will evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.\n\nThe Enhanced Aviation GATM Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) Navigation System (EAGLE) A-PNT integration program assesses current capabilities in identified operational PNT environment levels, tests identified upgrades to existing EGI hardware in order to accommodate A-PNT in identified operational environments, and incorporates M-Code.  It supports DoD and Army's requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations and requires assessment and follow-on upgrade to the EGI navigation system.  The EAGLE upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance, associated PNT capability gaps, integrate anti-jam antenna capabilities, and evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.\n\nThe Degraded Visual Environment\/Brownout Rotorcraft Enhancement System (DVE\/BORES) program increases survivability for both tactical operations and training missions within the Degraded Visual Environment which severely reduces or eliminates the aircrew's visibility due to atmospheric obscurants. DVE\/BORES will combine obscurant penetrating sensor(s) with aircraft state data, via a fusion\/synthetic vision system, to provide an initial capability for ground taxi, hover, takeoff and landing modes of flight during brownout conditions. DVE\/BORES will improve safety, reduce risk and add flexibility to aviation units by enhancing aircrew awareness through real-time detection and warning of terrain, obstacles and hazards. DVE\/BORES will consist of integrated rotorcraft pilotage sensor(s), software, software related firmware, and pilot to system interfaces and cueing.\n\nThe Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army aviation automated information system program providing specific capabilities needed at the aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation operations, safety, and training to increase operational effectiveness and situational awareness at all command echelons.  ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement the DoD mandated Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. ADEC will standardize flight scheduling\/management, risk management, mission approval, and flight data analysis and visualization. ADEC provides interfaces to Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS) to reduce data entry and the information technology footprint while enabling disconnected and split based operations.\n\nThe Improved Data Modem (IDM) provides digital connectivity among airborne and ground platforms and transmission of air-to-air target data between IDM equipped aircraft using existing radio and crypto equipment. IDM new software architecture will incorporate the ability to host IDM functionality on hardware that meets the minimum requirements to run the IDM Operating Flight Program. These efforts will include development and testing of that capability, as well as any documentation required to ensure Government Purpose rights to the new software.\n\nThe FY 2018 funding request was reduced by $7.397 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."

The DGNS upgrade continues with execution of Non-Recurring Engineering for CDU and Signal Data Converter LRU ECP packages.  The ASN-128D CDU Upgrade replaces the current CDU faceplate with a touch screen display, provides a moving navigation map capability and optimized pilot interface to augment existing IFR capability and promote safer flight operations.  It also enables CDU support for A-PNT operations in conjunction with additional system LRU upgrades, including anti-jam antenna capabilities."

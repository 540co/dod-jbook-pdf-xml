        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The Man-Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) Inc II is a modular system providing a multitude of standoff capabilities through different payloads for the Army. These capabilities include detect and confirm presence, identify disposition, and counter hazards by providing a platform for payloads in support of current and future mission requirements. Additionally, MTRS Inc II will support current and future payload missions for the engineer's route clearance platoons, Special Operational Forces (SOF) detachments, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units. \n\nRobotic Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts. It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interface, common software and common architecture for universal controllers. RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Squad Multi-Equipment Transport (SMET), Leader\/Follower (LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Inc II, Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), EOD Robotic Payload (ERP), Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Robotic Wingman, etc.) and new standards addressing emerging requirements (i.e. Cyber Security, Information Assurance, new autonomous behaviors, new payloads, etc).\n\nThe Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)) will be a man-packable, small (<25lbs), highly mobile, unmanned robotic system with advanced sensors\/mission modules for dismounted Service Members. The CRS(I) will be designed so the operator can quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and\/or payloads. The CRS(I) will also include the Army universal controller used by all unmanned ground and aerial vehicles within the battalion formation providing interoperability, logistics, and training efficiencies. The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces. This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the operating environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated Warfighting Force by providing standoff to the Warfighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations.\n\nSquad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) will help to reduce the load on the Soldier by transporting mission specific equipment, resupply equipment, and supplies required for extended operations.  The SMET  will be capable of carrying the equipment currently required to support Infantry and Engineer Platoons in the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) for a 72 hour mission without resupply. The SMET will reduce Soldier load, increase squad mobility during combat operations and dismounted maneuvers. SMET will have open architectures, operator control units and support casualty evacuation, power generation\/offload and chemical\/biological payloads.\n\nThe Robotics Enhancement Program (REP) uses a \"buy, try, and inform\" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a Cost-Benefit Analysis to support future Army decision making.\n\nThe Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS) provides a near term solution to three Army Warfighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver.  The SBS provides the Squad organic \u201cquick look\u201d capability when higher echelon assets are unavailable and time is of the essence.  The system is simple to use, expendable, and deployable in a matter of seconds to support the squad leader\u2019s decision-making process.  The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.\n\nThe MTRS Standardization project provides the platforms to support integration and testing of payloads and technology for non-standard unmanned ground robotics systems used by Army Engineers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) and Special Operational Forces (SOF) units.  Current system characteristics include the following: a remote controlled articulated arm with a gripper, operating range up to 800m, multiple illuminated cameras, a pan\/tilt surveillance camera, two-way radio, and a ruggedized operator control unit.  The platforms provided will support development and testing of the following capabilities:  High Dexterous Manipulation System (HDMS), Multi-Spectral Image Fusion System (MIFS), and Precision Aimed Multishot Disruptor (PAMD).  The use of robotics allows the first approach, to potentially explosive hazards, to be made by a robot rather than a Soldier.\nThis project will also supports the development of a library of robot parts that can be 3D printed via additive manufacturing.  The funding will also test the operational compatibility of the 3D printed parts with robot platforms."

The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated War-fighting Force by providing standoff to the War Fighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations."

This supported a rapid start to performance specification development and other Request For Proposal (RFP) documents in support of a Directed Requirement. The Directed Requirement will begin with User Assessment and down select of 4 vendors in FY17 as part of the Robotic Enhanced Program under the Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (654641DV7) funding line. In FY18 the 4 vendors will participate in an User Operational Excursion. This Excursion will guide the development of the Capability Production Document (CPD) in 3QFY19 leading to a program of record with anticipated Milestone C in 4QFY19 and First Unit Equipped (FUE) 1QFY21.\n\nIt is the Army's intent to maximize the use of an Open Systems Architecture (OSA), as well as the approved Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) interoperability profiles for SMET. The PdM plans to procure sufficient technical data during the SMET contract to allow for future competition of production systems and spare parts, or seek cost savings by incorporating the developed SMET technology into other programs. Throughout the life of the program, the Army will continue to survey the marketplace to identify opportunities for technology insertion and competition."

Current system characteristics include the following: a remote controlled articulated arm with a gripper, operating range up to 800m, multiple illuminated cameras, a pan\/tilt surveillance camera, two-way radio, and a ruggedized operator control unit.  The platforms provided will support development and testing of the following capabilities:  High Dexterous Manipulation System (HDMS), Multi-Spectral Image Fusion System (MIFS), and Precision Aimed Multishot Disruptor (PAMD).  The use of robotics allows the first approach, to potentially explosive hazards, to be made by a robot rather than a Soldier.\n\nThis project will also supports the development of a library of robot parts that can be 3D printed via additive manufacturing.  The funding will also test the operational compatibility of the 3D printed parts with robot platforms.\n\nThis project is a new start."

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage targets at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day\/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments). Project K70 pursues technologies that provide our Warfighters with a Common Operating Picture (COP) to enable increased situational understanding and combat overmatch. Specific areas of maturation and demonstration include technologies that integrate disparate sensor architectures, perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), enable passive long range target identification (ID), improve day\/night visualization systems, allow rapid wire area search, and facilitate augmented reality. Project K86 matures and validates airborne platform sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment, and deception. This Project provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots\/crew members independently to enhanced operations in day\/night\/adverse weather conditions. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).   \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM)."

This effort allows combat vehicle commanders and crewmen to detect difficult or concealed small unit threats as well as to identify and apply countermeasures to enable maneuver or response. The effort leverages advanced IR imaging technology, multispectral laser technologies and precise far target location technology to increase target detection and reduce target acquisition timelines. This effort supports the Army's initiatives in new sensing modalities that integrate with existing on board systems for multi-function capabilities, with minimal weight, to enable protected mobility to increase protection against current and emerging threats. This work is a follow on of work from ?Advanced Sensors for Precision? to provide an additional level of detail.  This work ends in FY17 and transitions to PEO Soldier."

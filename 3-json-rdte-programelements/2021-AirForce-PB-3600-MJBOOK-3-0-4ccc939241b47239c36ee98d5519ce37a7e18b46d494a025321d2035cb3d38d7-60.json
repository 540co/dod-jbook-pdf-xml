                            "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1201017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1201017SF Global Sensor Integrated on Network from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force. \n\n$1.889M is included in FY 2021 in this request for Appropriation 3600, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Air Force, PE 1201017F; these funds should have been requested under Appropriation 3620 Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1201017SF. Justification and plans for these funds are included in PE 1201017SF, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), R-1 Line #26.\n\nThe missions of USSPACECOM and USSTRATCOM include establishing and providing full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. \n\nThe Nation's strategic C2 sensors, and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. GSIN developed and established a unified schema that integrates disparate Missile Warning\/Missile Defense (MW\/MD) data into a single, exposed data set, providing redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership. GSIN also enables existing radars and sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning, execution, and future program planning.\n\nGSIN directly supports USSPACECOM, USSTRATCOM and other Combatant Command and MAJCOM mission sets. GSIN meshes together selected systems and sensors (from tactical to strategic), including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility, and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Repurposing these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. GSIN enables creation of a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing realtime collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. GSIN also improves Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability and provides this data for the larger space order of battle capabilities. GSIN dramatically improves the ingestion of nontraditional, but readily available, non-US government and commercial data to the United States Space Force (USSF) satellite catalog. GSIN addresses NORTHCOM\/STRATCOM's signed Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) ST-0010 request for uninterrupted traditional and non-traditional sensor data integration and the Global Threat Characterization Assessment (GTCA) Operational Planning Team report. GSIN provides critical and unique data to the USSPACECOM SSA data repositories to facilitate the large Space Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) suite of capabilities\/programs. Finally, GSIN provides Machine Learner and Data Analysis functions to optimize and operate situational awareness in the field.\n\nSpace Acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GSIN weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F,0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

On completion of Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Interoperability Test Certification (JITC), MDA authorized Full Rate Production (FRP) in 1QFY14. First unit equipped (FUE) was successfully conducted 3QFY15.\n\nDevelopmental efforts are being performed through intra-government collaboration. System engineering efforts are being performed by C5ISR's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD); Command, Power and Integration (CP&I) and the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD). Those efforts are intended to inform a BFT-3 full and open solicitation (RFP) to industry FY21.  Hardware along with fielding, training and field support efforts are obtained through existing competitively awarded contracts."

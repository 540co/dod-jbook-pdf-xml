Army watercraft equipment enables the conduct of riverine, Logistics-over-the-Shore (LOTS) and Joint Logistics-over-the-Shore (JLOTS), inter and intra-theater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100.01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and it's major components).  Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterways and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conducting operations through littoral entry points (developed, undeveloped, and austere access points) and in non-permissive, and\/or denied access scenarios.  The Army uses a spectrum of Army Watercraft systems, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intra-theater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to oceangoing and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port\/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems for (LOTS\/JLOTS).  The funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, energy efficiency, environmental, regulatory compliance and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will address critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies. To support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, funding efforts will include conducting trade studies, Business Case Analyses (BCA) to inform the requirement development process, and support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The funding enables our compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and compliance with Environmental protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.\n\nFY19 funding will primarily support maturation of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) design for the Modular Warping Tug (MWT), support continued integration of Force Protection, and environmental projects."

It supports initiatives that are essential to the development and fielding of modernized TEP sources from Watts to Megawatts level that will extend Army operational mission reach and duration through the improvements to efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and interoperability in support of the Army Operating Concept and Multi-Domain Battle. FY19 funding will support test and evaluation of technologies in support of Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP), Management and Distribution Control (MDC), and Command Post Infrastructure Integration (CPI2). Technologies include hybrid power systems, open architecture tactical microgrids, command post infrastructure, and validated methods to prove out suitability and effectiveness. Funding also supports the Joint Operational Energy Initiative (JOEI), a holistic Modeling and Simulation approach to the evaluation of Operational Energy (OE)-related theater-wide impacts of systems and improvements with the vision of reducing Army energy dependency and demand. Program costs include developing concept hardware and executing system evaluations at Army demonstration events and exercises (AEWE, AWA, etc.)"

This project develops critical enablers that support the Army in executing future movement and maneuver operations and distributed sustainment support by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support."

The mission includes developing fuel quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics footprint; alternative source water acquisition, reutilization and disposal systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; water purification and waste water treatment and material systems to decrease the logistics footprint and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in joint operations area.  This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile joint operations areas.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield."

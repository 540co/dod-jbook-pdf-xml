            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates technologies to enhance Airman performance and effectiveness in the aerospace force. State-of-the-science advances are made in warfighter training, warfighter system interfaces, directed energy bioeffects, deployment and sustainment of warfighters in extreme environments, and understanding and shaping adversarial behavior. The Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to predict, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of directed energy on personnel and mission performance, and exploits the offensive capabilities of directed energy systems. The Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to sustain airman performance in adverse operational and\/or training environments, monitor and mitigate in-flight unexplained physiological events, and prevent human performance related mishaps through real-time monitoring and mitigation\u2014particularly through highly automated or autonomous systems. The Mission Effective Performance project develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced training, simulation, mission rehearsal, and other performance-aiding methods and technologies to enhance warfighter readiness. The Warfighter Interfaces project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to revolutionize the way airmen synergistically use Air Force systems, including autonomous machines and adaptive teams of airmen and machines. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635323, Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters, and Project 635324, Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration, will be transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635325, Mission Effective Performance, will be transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 635327, Warfighter Interfaces, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness and C2 Tech.  Skyborg Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start.  This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Airman Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and Joint Base San Antonio - Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

This project develops tools and plug-ins that enhance mission and engagement models, provide predictive risk analysis for deployment of Directed Energy systems, and analyzes systems for use in the Department of Defense.  This project develops tools and analysis techniques to model and demonstrate the use of fielded protection on Airman performance, and informs developers of design specifications to optimize design of novel weapon systems.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635323, Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters, will be transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos, Project 635323, Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Airman Systems Technology Directorate located in Joint Base San Antonio - Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Airman Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Heavy emphasis is placed on human-machine teaming including workflow design and integration of both automated and human-generated results. Effort leverages significant infrastructure in big-data design and capture, allowing for rapid prototyping of capabilities directly to web-based platforms on classified environments. Program directly supports contested-denied operations in a multi-domain environment."

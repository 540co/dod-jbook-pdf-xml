NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid prototype development to transition to SOCOM Programs of Records. These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM\u2019s existing MIPs. NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM\u2019s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improving detection of Low-Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection signals, and automating radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using National Technical Means in support of tactical operators."

The Programs of Records (POR) will leverage Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)\/Government Off The Shelf\/ and Non-Developmental  Item capabilities requiring minimal modifications wherever possible. JTWS is making deliberate investments to evolve the program into modular\/scalable systems with a framework supporting open architecture in order to provide common solutions across the variants, increase interoperability, and reduce duplication of efforts.   JTWS will address the continuously evolving threat environments on the Ground, Air, Maritime, and Unmanned Aircraft System variants, leverage existing partnerships with the National Security Agency and other government partners to integrate and sustain systems based on prioritized need from the Components and as emerging threats require technology modernizations.  The contracting strategy is a mixture of full and open competition for prime integrators and leveraging existing Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for COTS procurement.\n\n\u2022   HF-TTL utilizes an acquisition strategy to provide highly sophisticated TTL and close target audio\/video devices capable of operating in various environments as needed to meet SOF operational requirements. Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, device level modifications, integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.  \n\n\u2022  TVS\/RSTA employs an evolutionary strategy to incorporate the latest state of technology within its product line to provide upgraded next-generation technology insertion of COTS systems and address the changing threat environment to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations. \n\n\u2022   SOFPREP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.\n\n\u2022   ISP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.\n\n\u2022   SSE uses a commodity procurement rapid acquisition strategy to provide next-generation technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities supporting SOF exploitation mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations."

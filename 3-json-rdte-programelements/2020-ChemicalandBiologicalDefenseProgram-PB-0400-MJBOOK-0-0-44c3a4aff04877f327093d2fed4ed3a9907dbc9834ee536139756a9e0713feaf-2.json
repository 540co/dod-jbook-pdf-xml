            "val": "The projects in this program element (PE) demonstrate technologies supporting transition to advanced component development for physical capabilities which cover biological and chemical detection, situational awareness and effects modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Other major efforts support enhanced chemical detection capabilities for aerosols and non-traditional agents, expanded capabilities for early warning in pathogen detection and diagnosis, and pretreatments and therapeutics against a broader set of chemical and biological agents.  Medical capabilities (pretreatments, therapeutics, diagnostics capabilities, and drug manufacturing and regulatory science technologies), include capabilities against non-traditional agents.\n\nIndividual projects include:\n- Chemical Biological Defense (CB3): demonstrations of CB physical science defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, digital battlespace management, and protection, and decontamination. The Project continues to pursue solutions against traditional agents.\n\n- NTA Defense (NT3): dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) is consolidated in NT3. This effort includes NTA chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.\n\n- Medical Defense (TM3): aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents. Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.\n\n- Technology Transition (TT3): pursues federal R&D or commercially available products to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.\n\nThe CBDP S&T Advanced Technology Development stakeholders: United States Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), United States Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, Naval Research Lab (NRL), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), among others. The intent is to maintain strategic partnerships with the DoD Service communities for mission success across the enterprise through collaborative planning and programming maintaining budget assurance.\n\nThis PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for PE 0603884BP and PE 0604384BP activities."

Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated. Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can remain in place for future extended user evaluations, accepted into the advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full- scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development. \n- This project addresses the four primary thrust areas of Sense, Shape, Shield, and Sustain, with an emphasis on Integrated Early Warning. Integrated Early Warning is conducted through a coordinated program approach focused on layering Chemical and Biological Detection technologies and integrating CB threat indicators to provide combination of awareness and understanding that facilitates effective (timely) decision making so the force can continue military operations and achieve mission success in a CBRN environment."

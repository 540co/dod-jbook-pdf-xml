In January of 2018, PU 3279 was established for the Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS)."

            "val": "The MQ-25 program rapidly develops an unmanned capability to embark on Carrier Vessel, Nuclear (CVN) as part of the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) to conduct aerial refueling as a primary mission and provide Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) capability as a secondary mission.  MQ-25 extends CVW mission effectiveness range, partially mitigates the current Carrier Strike Group (CSG) organic ISR shortfall and fills the future CVW-tanker gap, mitigating Strike Fighter shortfall and preserving F\/A-18E\/F Fatigue Life for its primary missions. As the first carrier-based, group 5 Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), MQ-25 will pioneer the integration of manned and unmanned operations, demonstrate mature complex sea-based Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) UAS technologies, and pave the way for future multifaceted multi-mission UAS to pace emerging threats.  \n\nMQ-25 requirements are aligned with the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Family of Systems (FoS) ICD, which highlight the need for carrier-based refueling  and persistent ISR capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) endorsed the UCLASS ICD in April 2011 and formally approved it on 9 Jun 11 via Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 087-11.  The NGAD FoS ICD was validated by the JROC on 18 August 2015 and formally approved by JROCM 087-15. The JROC's guidance delineated in the validated ICDs and subsequent JROCMs was to establish a requirement for a versatile platform that supports a myriad of organic Naval missions such as aerial refueling and ISR to support the CVW. The JROC validated the Capability Development Document for MQ-25 Carrier Based Unmanned Air System on 21 July 2017. After contract award in 2018, an opportunity to accelerate Initial Operational Capability (IOC) to 2024 was recognized, and the Navy decided to make the investments required to capture that opportunity by increasing the number of test carrier installs to four and funding System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) production to start in FY20.\n\nThe Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS) program consists of the MQ-25 control station, designated the MD-5, and modifications to the C4I systems and CVN infrastructure required for MQ-25 vehicle and mission control.\n\nThis program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION  because it includes projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production decision."

                            "val": "The MQ-25 program rapidly develops an unmanned capability to embark on CVNs as part of the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) to conduct aerial refueling  as a primary mission and provide Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) capability as a secondary mission.  MQ-25 extends CVW mission effectiveness range, partially mitigates the current Carrier Strike Group (CSG) organic ISR shortfall and fills the future CVW-tanker gap, mitigating Strike Fighter shortfall and preserving F\/A-18E\/F Fatigue Life for its primary missions. As the first carrier-based, group 5 Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), MQ-25 will pioneer the integration of manned and unmanned operations, demonstrate mature complex sea-based Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) UAS technologies, and pave the way for future multifaceted multi-mission UAS to pace emerging threats.  \n\nMQ-25 requirements are aligned with the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Family of Systems (FoS) ICD, which highlight the need for carrier-based refueling  and persistent ISR capabilities.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) endorsed the UCLASS ICD in April 2011 and formally approved it on 9 Jun 11 via Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 087-11.  The NGAD FoS ICD was validated by the JROC on 18 August 2015 and formally approved by JROCM 087-15. The JROC's guidance delineated in the validated ICDs and subsequent JROCMs was to establish a requirement for a versatile platform that supports a myriad of organic Naval missions such as aerial refueling and ISR to support the CSG. The JROC validated the Capability Development Document (CDD) for MQ-25 Carrier Based Unmanned Air System (CBUAS) on 21 July 2017. After contract award in 2018, an opportunity to accelerate Initial Operational Capability (IOC) to 2024 was recognized, and the Navy decided to make the investments required to capture that opportunity by increasing the number of test carrier installs to four and funding System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) production to start in FY20.\n\nMQ-25 will be designed to conduct aerial refueling and ISR missions.  MQ-25 will have the ability to refuel all carrier based fixed wing aircraft capable of aerial refueling and to pass sensor data to other aircraft, naval vessels, and ground forces.  Sensor data will be transmitted at appropriate classification levels, to exploitation nodes afloat and ashore (e.g. Distributed Common Ground System - Navy).  The MQ-25 system will be sustainable onboard an aircraft carrier, as well as ashore, and will be designed to minimize the logistics footprint of the current CVW.\n\nMQ-25 will achieve these capabilities through the use of a carrier-suitable, semi-autonomous, unmanned Air Segment and the UCA Mission Control System (UMCS) that provides CVN infrastructure modifications and hardware to support MQ-25 operations aboard all NIMITZ class carriers (except CVN 68), all delivered and planned FORD class carriers, and operational shore sites. The Government will perform Lead Systems Integration (LSI), providing government-led system of systems integration for the MQ-25 Program. The program will coordinate across all segments and with external stakeholders to ensure program activities are synchronized.  MQ-25 will interface with existing ship and land-based command and control systems, including ISR Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination systems. \n\nThe scope of the program includes, but is not limited to, system level requirements identification, allocation of requirements to segments and components, design, development, integration, fabrication, test, training, and support activities to provide the MQ-25 capabilities. To accomplish these capabilities, MQ-25 will transition (as required) technologies from other programs and adapt them into the carrier environment.  MQ-25 will deliver the necessary air vehicles, command, control, connectivity, shipboard and land-based launch and recovery control systems, associated support systems, interfaces, and upgrades to other Navy systems (as required) to meet the required capabilities."

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2430(d)(1), the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) is ASN(RDA).\n\nThe MQ-25 system will enhance carrier (CVN) capability and versatility for the Joint Forces Commander through the integration of a persistent, sea-based, multi-mission aerial refueling and reconnaissance Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) into the Carrier Air Wing (CVW).  MQ-25 is comprised of an Air Segment (AS) and the UCA Mission Control System (UMCS).  These architectural segments will be managed by the PMA-268 Government Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) that provides system-of-systems integration and is also responsible for managing enterprise-level UCA architecture and associated interfaces. \n\nMQ-25 will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy to develop, fly, deploy, and evolve an Initial Operational Capability system for fleet integration.  This MQ-25 acquisition strategy will support the development of the MQ-25 AS, supporting control and connectivity systems, and CVN modifications required for entry into Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) in 2018 with an objective IOC of 2024.  \n\nMQ-25 awarded a fixed price incentive, firm target (FPIF) contract for the AS EMD contract to Boeing in Aug 2018."

                            "val": "The Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS) program builds, integrates, and installs control systems required to operate the MQ-25. The UMCS program includes what was previously identified as the Control System & Connectivity (CS&C) and Carrier Vessel, Nuclear (CVN) Segments previously captured under the MQ-25 Development PU 3278.\n\nUMCS builds the following hardware: Mission Control Station (MCS), the Video Management System (VidMS), the ARC-210 Radio Communication System (RCS), and the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) RCS (MRCS). The MCS has a ship and shore variant designated the MD-5A and MD-5B, respectively. The MD-5 consists of the following subsystems: Common Display System (CDS), Common Processing System (CPS), Network Processing Group (NPG), Integrated Communication System (ICS), and the Stingray Operating Software Suite (SOSS). MD-5A and B use the same common components with slight differences in the ICS, SOSS, and networking equipment. The VidMS provides MQ-25 operators the required video situational awareness of the unmanned carrier environment. The ARC-210 RCS provides narrow band Line of Sight (LOS) command and control (C2) transmissions with the MQ-25 while the MRCS provides narrow band Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) C2 transmissions with the MQ-25 using the MUOS satellite system.\n\nUMCS integrates with the MQ-25 air system, local networks, voice networks, C2 networks, tactical networks, intelligence systems, and launch and recovery systems.\n\nUMCS performs CVN infrastructure modifications and installs the hardware mentioned above in support of MQ-25 operations aboard all NIMITZ class carriers (except CVN 68), all delivered and planned FORD class carriers, and the operational shore sites. All CVN installation and integration activities are planned and executed using the Ship Change Document (SCD) process. Installation and integration activities at the operational shore site are planned and executed via a method similar to the SCD process tailored to shore facilities.\n\nCVN installations are regulated by Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) processes\/guidelines that delineate strict schedules and deadlines for documentation, drawings, and hardware availability to support carrier modifications and by the CVN availability schedule (revised at least twice per year) which identifies pre-planned maintenance periods for all NIMITZ and FORD Class CVNs. Changes to the NAVSEA owned CVN availability schedule could, in turn, drive changes to the UMCS installation schedule.\n\nThe CVN modification and hardware installation process can be divided into four phases. Phase 1 is characterized by the development of technical data packages (TDPs), general and specific CVN hull number guidance documents, and the SCDs to be installed and begin approximately three years, or more, before the start of the CVN maintenance period. Phase 2 is characterized by the performance of a hull specific Ship Check, development of the SIDs for a specific CVN installation, and the purchase of the MD-5 subsystems, the VidMS, and the LOS\/BLOS subsystems and begins two years before the start of the CVN maintenance period. Phase 3 is characterized by the approval of the SIDs, development of installation schedules, completion of cybersecurity\/logistics documentation, and the integration and testing of the MD-5 and associated subsystems and begins approximately one year prior to the start of the CVN maintenance period. Phase 4 is characterized by the modification of the CVN infrastructure, installation of the MD-5 and associated subsystems, and completion of the system operational verification testing (SOVT) and begins as early as the beginning of the CVN maintenance period with the duration dependent the maintenance period and the number of SCDs being installed. Due to the size and complexity of UMCS modifications required to prepare the CVN, a scheduled maintenance period of at least six months is required."

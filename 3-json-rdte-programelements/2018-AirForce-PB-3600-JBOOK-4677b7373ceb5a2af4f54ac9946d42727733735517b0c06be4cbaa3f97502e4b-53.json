This aircraft creates an air bridge enabling rapid global mobility and global strike missions.  There are 59 KC-10A aircraft in the USAF tanker fleet.    \n\nMode 5 is a FAA mandated upgrade program to the USAF Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, the primary means of command and control aircraft identification.  Mode 5 increases anti-spoofing capabilities and lowers the possibility of aircraft\/aircrew loss due to misidentification of friendly aircraft.  The KC-10 modification program includes a Mode 5 capable APX-119 transponder, a new KIV-77 crypto applique and integration\/control through the CDU-7000F flight management computer. \n\nAn FAA mandated Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) upgrade to the KC-10 is also included as part of Mode 5 to meet DO-260B requirements set by the FAA. Both Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 and Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) Out are mandated programs (JROCM 047-07 and FAA Advisory Circular 20-165A) that have a required incorporation NLT 1 Jan 2020 (ADS-B) and 1 July 2020 (Mode 5).  Both modifications are accomplished by modification of the APX-119 Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) and can easily be accomplished at the same time and at a significant cost savings to the USAF. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  \n\nThe program will include a Technology Maturation Risk Reduction Study (TMRR), Formal EMD, Procurement and Installation on KC-10 aircraft."

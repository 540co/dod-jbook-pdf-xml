            "val": "This Program Element (PE) aligns system development and demonstration of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (HTV) with Future Force requirements to support combat and combat support missions. Missions include the following: line haul, local haul, and unit resupply. HTV trucks transport water, ammunition, and general cargo over all terrain and throughout the battle-space. Systems include the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Palletized Load System (PLS), Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS), Line Haul, Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) as well as Recovery Systems that rescue large wheeled vehicle platforms in severe off-road conditions such as the Modular Catastrophic Recovery System (MCRS). Funding will also be used for developing the Army's next generation of tactical trucks, as part of the Army's Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Modernization Strategy. This Program Element (PE) supports the Family of Heavy Trucks to include, enablers, active safety technologies, and heavy tactical trailer development. Periodic evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection as described in the Long Term Protection Strategy (LTPS) is also supported by this PE for both the HTV family of vehicles and the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV).  The Army plans to procure a replacement for the DODX 40000 series tank hauling rail car.  The existing fleet will begin mandatory retirement starting in 2031.  In order to maintain the current capability of hauling two tanks per rail car and the increased weight of the tank, the Army will be developing a new 150+ ton articulated rail car that is supported by this PE.\n\nFY 2019 Project 659 Base funds in the amount of $1.979 million are for the research and development of a solution to modify the HETS M1070A1 tractor and increase capability to an 85 Ton payload. Funding will also be used for Systems Engineering\/Program Management (SEPM) for the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) to develop contracting documentation, System Engineering Plans (SEP) and Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMP). SEPM includes PM and System Engineering oversight required to manage the program and provide contractor oversight. Salaries, Benefits, Travel, Personnel Training and other Government costs are included for retaining a professional acquisition workforce.\n\nFY 2019 Project E50 Base funds in the amount of $5.293 million will be used to build Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) Armor Capable Truck Asset Prototypes and Armor Solution testing. Armor Solution testing costs include system testing, evaluation and document production for the HDT program. Funding will also be used for the research and development of a solution to modify the HETS M1070A1 tractor and increase capability to an 85 Ton payload.\n\nFY 2019 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $4.678 million will be used to build Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) Armor Capable Truck Asset Prototypes and Armor Solution testing.

The current HETS has two capability gaps; Payload and Road Network Accessibility.  The HETS is not capable of transporting or loading\/unloading the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT since it exceeds the HETS rated payload of 70 tons (U.S.).  Road Network Accessibility of the current HETS is restricted due to exceeding axle load limits CONUS\/OCONUS, which prevents the HETS from obtaining road permits.  Short term is an interim solution to modify current HETS tractors and build new HETS trailers and the long term solution is the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) that will address these capability gaps in the future.  \n\nThe current interim solution is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) for Heavy Equipment Transporter Systems with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.\n\nThe Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) is a force protected tractor and trailer to operationally move and load\/unload the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT.  EHETS will be capable of transporting at a higher rated payload and will self-load\/unload heavy and outsized equipment such as the Abrams SEPv2 and SEPv3, which currently exceeds the existing Heavy Equipment Transporter System rated capacity of 70-tons (U.S.), while achieving road network accessibility (e.g. road permits) and mobility on primary and secondary roads.  \n\nFY 2019 Project 659 Base funds in the amount of $0.300 million are for Systems Engineering\/Program Management (SEPM) for the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) to develop contracting documentation, Systems Engineering Plans (SEP) and Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMP). SEPM includes PM and System Engineering oversight required to manage the program and provide contractor oversight. Salaries, Benefits, Travel, Personnel Training and other Government costs are included for retaining a professional acquisition workforce.\n\nFY 2019 Project 659 Base funds in the amount of $1.679 million are for the research and development of a solution to modify the HETS M1070A1 tractor and increase carrying capacity to 85 tons."

The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.\n\nBased on the outcome of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and Materiel Development Decision (MDD), the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) is expected to enter at MS B and the acquisition will be a full and open competition.  Planned efforts include:  Requirements Analysis (FY18), Milestone B, Test plans and RFP documentation preparation (FY19-FY21), RFP release (FY22), and EMD Contract Award (FY23)."

All technical requirements are tested and confirmed prior to start of production.  In addition, each program has the ability to perform added tests during production as required to assure technical requirements are being met. The product office also uses Project Recon to perform risk management. The tool is designed to capture, manage, and link Risks, Issues, and Opportunities in a centralized database to create an integrated model that covers the entire program lifecycle."

                            "val": "The Semi Trailer Low Bed (STLB) is a 25-ton payload capacity semi-trailer with a fixed goose neck, step deck, and rear loading ramps.  The STLB is interoperable with a variety of trucks residing across the U.S. Army equipment and will be introduced into a theater of operations to transport construction equipment (CE) employed by U.S. Army Engineers to execute horizontal and vertical construction projects in support of U.S. Military or other national goals and objectives. The STLB is employed to transport CE, miscellaneous equipment, disabled equipment, Class IV (construction materials), and logistical provisions. The STLB supports units in the execution of the following tasks: expand the lodgment, construction\/upgrade\/rehabilitation and maintenance of main supply routes (MSR), alternate supply routes (ASR), logistical facilities, bituminous roads, helipads, airfields, landing strips, motor pools, parking areas, etc. These types of facilities are required for sustainment operations during decisive action operations. The STLB will also be used during routine exercises\/deployments, disaster relief, and other nation building operations. The STLB will be capable of supporting mobility, counter mobility, survivability, counter improvised and sustainment needs and all applicable North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) interoperability criteria. \n\nThe Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) is comprised of a M1070A1 Tractor and M1000 Trailer for transport, recovery and evacuation of heavy, oversized combat equipment such as the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank and M88 or similar loads.  The current HETS has two capability gaps; Payload and Road Network Accessibility.  The HETS is not capable of transporting or loading\/unloading the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT since it exceeds the HETS rated payload of 70 tons (U.S.).  Road Network Accessibility of the current HETS  is restricted due to exceeding axle load limits CONUS\/OCONUS, which prevents the HETS from obtaining road permits.  Short term is an interim solution to modify current HETS tractors and build new HETS trailers and the long term solution is the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) that will address these capability gaps in the future.  \n\nThe current interim solution is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) for Heavy Equipment Transporter Systems with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY 2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.  \n\nThe Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) is a force protected tractor and trailer to operationally move and load\/unload the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT.  EHETS will be capable of transporting at a higher rated payload and will self-load\/unload heavy and outsized equipment such as the Abrams SEPv2 and SEPv3, which currently exceeds the existing Heavy Equipment Transporter System rated capacity of 70-tons (U.S.), while achieving road network accessibility (e.g. road permits) and mobility on primary and secondary roads.  \n\nThe Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) supports construction projects by loading, transporting and dumping payloads of sand and gravel aggregates, crushed rock, hot asphalt mixes, earth, clay, rubble, large boulders and other materials up to gross vehicle weight rating to job sites under world-wide climatic conditions.  The HDT also serves as a quarry truck for the quick transport of bulk raw earth material to and from the crushing, screening and washing plant and the asphalt mixing plant.  The HDT also serves as a transportation asset for organizational equipment.  The HDT is Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) compliant with MRAP 1.1 underbody protection.  The armor solution is developed concurrently with the production of armor capable HDTs.  Upon development of the armor solution, the Government procures the armored HDT's.\n\nFY 2019 Project E50 Base funds in the amount of $3.793 million will be used to build Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) Armor Capable Truck Asset Prototypes and Armor Solution testing. The HDT integrated armor requirement is compliant with the Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) Ballistic Specifications.  It is required to replace the F5070, M917 and M917A1 HDTs with the oldest fielded variants at 50 years of age.\n\nFY 2019 Project E50 Base funds in the amount of $1.500 million are for the research and development of a solution to modify the HETS M1070A1 tractor and increase carrying capacity to 85 tons."

The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.\n\nThe Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) overall strategy includes a contract to one Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to develop an armor solution for a commercial dump truck.  The commercial dump truck (capable of being armored) will be produced prior to the development of this armor solution.  This armored solution will be tested prior to approval for build to incorporate into the HDT production.  The armored HDT will be procured after successful completion of the armor Live Fire Test (LFT) in FY21."

All technical requirements are tested and confirmed prior to start of production.  In addition, each program has the ability to perform added tests during production as required to assure technical requirements are being met. The product office also uses Project Recon to perform risk management. The tool is designed to capture, manage, and link Risks, Issues, and Opportunities in a centralized database to create an integrated model that covers the entire program lifecycle."

                            "val": "This program element supports periodic, evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection for Heavy Tactical Vehicles (HTV) and Medium Tactical Vehicles (MTV) as described in the Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) Strategy and individual variants' Capability Production Documents.  The upgrades will leverage the Army Technology Objective's (ATO) survivability and Army Research Laboratory's (ARL) research and development activities to develop and evaluate armor kits which increase the protection level of all HTVs to the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) protection level as well as anticipating changing threat environments, protection gaps, or improving the operating performance, efficiency, and reliability through armor weight reduction. This Program Element (PE) also supports increasing crew protection by leveraging advancements in autonomous ground vehicle technology via development and evaluation of autonomous applique kits that can be applied to the current and future HTV fleet.\n\nThe Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) supports construction projects by loading, transporting and dumping payloads of sand and gravel aggregates, crushed rock, hot asphalt mixes, earth, clay, rubble, large boulders and other materials up to gross vehicle weight rating to job sites under world-wide climatic conditions.  The HDT also serves as a quarry truck for the quick transport of bulk raw earth material to and from the crushing, screening and washing plant and the asphalt mixing plant.  The HDT also serves as a transportation asset for organizational equipment.  The HDT is Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) compliant with MRAP 1.1 underbody protection.  The armor solution is developed concurrently with the production of armor capable HDTs.  Upon development of the armor solution, the Government procures the armored HDT's.\n\nThe Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) is comprised of a M1070A1 Tractor and M1000 Trailer for transport, recovery and evacuation of heavy, oversized combat equipment such as the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank and M88 or similar loads.  The current HETS has two capability gaps; Payload and Road Network Accessibility.  The HETS is not capable of transporting or loading\/unloading the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT since it exceeds the HETS rated payload of 70 tons (U.S.).  Road Network Accessibility of the current HETS  is restricted due to exceeding axle load limits CONUS\/OCONUS, which prevents the HETS from obtaining road permits.  Short term is an interim solution to modify current HETS tractors and build new HETS trailers.\n\nThe current interim solution is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) for Heavy Equipment Transporter Systems with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.\n\nThe overall design was enhanced considerably on the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) Underbody Armor Kit and requires live fire testing to support Full Material Release.  The Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) requirement document issued for a Medium Tactical Truck (MTT) with model configuration upgrades needed to support required transport capabilities, armor capabilities, and load dimensions.  This Acquisition Strategy reduces operation and support costs, displaces vehicles which cannot be armored, and results in a more reliable fleet.\n\nFY 2019 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $2.378 million will be used to build two (2) Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) Armor Capable Truck Asset Prototypes and Armor Solution testing. Armor Solution testing costs include system testing, evaluation, and document production for the HDT program. The Government conducts Production Verification Testing (PVT), which includes First Production Vehicle Inspection (FPVI) and Logistics Development on an armor capable HDT, and Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) testing.  Upon development of the armor solution, the Government procures armored HDT's.\n                     \nFY 2019 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $1.500 million will be used for OGPK\/CROWS Weapon Station updates to existing logistic products, as well as hardware development in support of crew served weapons on unarmored and armored trucks.  There have been several survivability enhancements that have occurred since the HEMTT and PLS truck production program began. These enhancements did not incorporate measures to correct for automotive performance degradation that has occurred due to the additional mass of the survivability enhancements. Currently the HEMTTA4 and PLSA1 with top, side, underbody, fuel tank and RPG protection; as well as the addition of a weapon station, have overloaded the truck axles. To regain the original design performance and safety factors, new suspension components are required. \n\nFY 2019 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $0.800 million will be used for Live Fire Testing of the improvements to the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) A1P2 Underbody Armor Kit that are required to support Full Material Release."

This armored solution will be tested prior to approval for build to incorporate to the HDT production.  The armored HDT will be procured after successful completion of the armor live fire test in FY21.\n\nThe current interim solution for the Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY 2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.\n\nConduct FMTVA1P2 Underbody Armor Kit Live Fire Testing.  This effort will utilize Government test facilities.\n\nDesign, develop, prototype and test new axle, suspension components, and protected weapon station components. The new components will be tested and approved to be released as a stand-alone kit or revision to the current underbody armor kit (aka C-Kit).\n\nTechnical Data Package (TDP) Conversion from Prototype-level to Production-level: Funds will be used to convert and release a Production-level TDP. When complete, the kit can be procured."

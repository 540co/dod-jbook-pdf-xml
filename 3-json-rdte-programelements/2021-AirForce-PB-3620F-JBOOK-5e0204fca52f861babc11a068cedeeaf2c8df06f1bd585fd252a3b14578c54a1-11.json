                            "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1203269F, GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203269SF, GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 05 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three-dimensional positioning\/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec. 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.\n          \nThe system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under Program Element (PE) 1203164F), Space (funded under PE 1203265F, 1203165F, and 1203269F), and a Control Network (funded under PE 1206423F and 1203165F). The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals that are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. The user equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters (spherical error probable) worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense-Wide Mission Support (DWMS); Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.\n          \nGPS IIIF delivers GPS III satellites beyond the first ten Space Vehicles (SVs) being delivered by the GPS III program (funded in PE 1203265F GPS III Space Segment). The GPS IIIF satellites maintain the same capabilities as the GPS III satellites, but also delivers significant enhancements to include: potential on-ramping of advanced PNT technology from efforts such as NTS-3,  backward compatibility, unified S-Band (USB) interface compliance, integration of hosted payloads including a redesigned USNDS payload, Laser Retro-reflector Arrays (LRAs), Search and Rescue\/GPS (SAR\/GPS), Energetic Charged Particles (ECP) sensor, and Regional Military Protection (RMP) capabilities that provide the ability to deliver high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals in specific areas of intended effect. Implementation of RMP into the GPS Enterprise requires integration with the ground and user segments, executed by the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX), along with the Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) programs, respectively. The SAR\/GPS payload provided by Canada fills a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. LRA, built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL), is a passive reflector that improves accuracy and provides better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of the LRA.\n          \nThis PE funds the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) of GPS IIIF SVs 11-12 (to include Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support efforts). This program includes risk-reducing simulators and systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS IIIF satellites.\n          \nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $15.835 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances\n          \nThis PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GPS IIIF Space Segment weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n          \nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

During this time, the MDA approved the second phase of the two-phased GPS III Follow-On acquisition strategy. Executed using funds in PE 1203265F, GPS III Space Segment, the Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessments conducted during FY 2016-2017 provided data and insight into contractors' GPS satellite production designs with emphasis on a mature navigation payload and production-ready designs. Phase 1 results affirmed the viability of a competitive approach for Phase 2. The Phase 2 strategy directed the Air Force to conduct a full-and-open competition for GPS IIIF space vehicles and specified the use of RDT&E funds to deliver SVs 11-12 and conduct associated NRE. In addition to SVs 11-12, the RDT&E effort will be comprised of developing risk-reducing simulators, support test equipment, and conducting the systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS IIIF. The Air Force awarded the contract to Lockheed Martin in September 2018 and began the 1-year CDR campaign in March 2019. Completion of CDR is scheduled for March 2020 followed by Milestone C in Q3FY20.  Upon Milestone C approval, the Space Force will procure SV 13+ via annual contract options exercised Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF) and Space Procurement, Space Force (SPSF) funds consistent with full-funding policy under an annual buy approach."

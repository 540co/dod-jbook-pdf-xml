Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is necessary, but not sufficient, for pursued technology solutions. The Department of Defense transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are effective (for example, survivable, electronically protected, et cetera) while operating in both the United States and congested\/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed.\n\nThis program represents the Air Force investment within the SAR&DP. Budget for the Air Force portion of the DoD SAR&DP is created from the auction of Advanced Wireless Service licenses in execution year.\n\nFunding supports Spectrum relocation and sharing activities.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

DTRA\u2019s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.\n  \nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.\n \nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies."

The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event.

The Block II program will restore performance lost due to the added weight of safety and survivability equipment incorporated since initial fielding in 2007. Additional objectives of the Block II program include: Efficiently incorporating multiple engineering changes; Accomplishing required mid-life airframe recapitalization; Converging the special operations and conventional Army designs; Establishing a foundation for future block upgrades; and Maintaining the industrial base until Future Vertical Lift (FVL)-Heavy is realized."

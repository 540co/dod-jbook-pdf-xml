The applied research will provide the fundamental technologies to enable integrated performance-improving Learning - Warfighter Machine Interfaces (WMIs) that are scalable to multiple crew hardware and functional configurations; reconfigurable frameworks and simulation for concept experimentation and exploration; and team-centered dynamic tasking by machine intelligence to effectively utilize full capabilities of crew and technologies.  The research will generate soldier-informed data, reports, and analysis to support operational use in future vehicles; and soldier experimentation and assessment of technical concepts in simulation and in-field WMIs. The capabilities created by this research will lead to increased overall crew and team performance; improved soldier safety due to fewer soldier per vehicle, closed-hatch operations, and improved standoff from effective control; and vehicles that can effectively perform across multiple domains of battle.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command. \n\nThis work is done in coordination with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology)."

Work conducted in this Project will result in concepts for Adaptive and Cooperative Protection of ground combat vehicles.  Modern protective technology implements complex kinematic mechanisms in order to bend, break and disperse threat projectiles before they can injure crew or disable vehicles.  These \"mechanisms\" of the future will have unprecedented access to information through advanced sensors (electro-optic, infrared, radio frequency, magnetic, acoustic), data, communications, high speed digital signal processing, and fusion of information to initiate high-speed controls and actuation to adjust and adapt protective measures and materials.  The research strategy will develop experimental and computational tools and techniques (high resolution instrumentation to observe impact events, theories and algorithms to explain these phenomena and numerical implementation of these algorithms) for the development of mass-efficient armor mechanisms.  Complimentary armor mechanisms will be co-developed to create multi-threat armor technologies that meet specific military requirements and these will form the building blocks for Adaptive and Cooperative Protection Technologies.  Additionally research will focus on subcomponent\/component models to predict performance of early concepts and the means to evaluate effectiveness on ground platforms.  The Project will balance developments of active threat defeat measures with the necessary advanced passive and reactive components that will ultimately provide for full system solutions which meet the requirements of current and next generation ground tactical and combat vehicles.  The Emerging Overmatch Technologies effort will maximize the synergy between protection technologies that are complimentary to the lethality mission to re-establish overmatch of Army technologies.  \n\nThis Project is coordinated with and transition to Projects in PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) and builds upon weapon target interaction research in PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences) \/ Project AA7 (Mechanics and Ballistics).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle."

This Project will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using ML and other AI methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI\/ML techniques to develop intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for Global Positioning System. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to develop algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI\/ML techniques to develop intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAV mapped areas. Data collected from the UAV will be converted to maneuverable information for manned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go\/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nThis work is conducted by the United States Army Futures Command.\n\nThis work is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicles Advanced Technology)."

Designs and analyzes novel NGCV system level ground vehicle concepts by integrating advanced mobility, survivability, lethality, sensing and electrical\/electronic technologies to address emerging and future advanced threats.  This Project provides system level ground vehicle design concepts and performance analysis, assesses cost and performance trades, and provides real-time soldier feedback on technology performance for the Army's NGCVs.  Technologies to be evaluated include high efficiency advanced powertrains, power generation, active protection systems, active blast, advanced lethality and robotic control and autonomy technologies.  The NGCV virtual experiments provide an efficient means to give warfighters an up-front, virtual hands-on operational evaluation of next generation ground vehicle concepts and emerging technologies.  The Virtual Prototyping results provide critical inputs to the Army's NGCV program by providing independent technical and operational performance results, as well as assessing trades for the Army's next generation of ground combat vehicles.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority NGCV.\n\nThis work is conducted by United States Army Futures Command. \n\nWork in this Project is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology)."

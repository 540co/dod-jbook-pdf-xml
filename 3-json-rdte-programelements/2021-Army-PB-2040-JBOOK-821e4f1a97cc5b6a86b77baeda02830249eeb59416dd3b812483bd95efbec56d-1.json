            "val": "This PE builds fundamental scientific knowledge contributing to the sustainment of United States (US) Army scientific and technological superiority in land warfighting capability and to solving military problems related to long-term national security needs, investigates new concepts and technologies for the Army's future force, and provides the means to exploit scientific breakthroughs and avoid technological surprises. This PE fosters innovation in Army niche areas (e.g., lightweight armor, energetic materials, and night vision capability) and areas where there is no commercial investment due to limited markets (e.g., vaccines for tropical diseases). It also focuses university single investigator research on areas of high interest to the Army (e.g., high-density compact power and novel sensor phenomenology). The in-house portion of the program capitalizes on the Army's scientific talent and specialized facilities to transition knowledge and technology into appropriate developmental activities. The extramural program leverages the research efforts of other government agencies, academia, and industry.  This PE also supports basic research at the Army laboratories through the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program.  The ILIR program serves as a catalyst for major technology breakthroughs by providing laboratory directors flexibility in implementing novel research ideas, by nurturing promising young scientists and engineers, and is used to attract and retain top doctoral degreed scientists and engineers. The ILIR program also provides a source of competitive funds for peer reviewed efforts at Army laboratories to stimulate high quality, innovative research with significant opportunity for payoff to Army warfighting capability.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This Project focuses on the fundamental underpinnings of aided and unaided target detection and identification techniques for land warfare scenarios.  This research enables Army systems that can act independently of the human operator to detect and track targets including clandestine tracking of non-cooperative targets.  Such capabilities are needed for smart munitions, unattended ground sensors, and as replacements for existing systems.  Critical technology issues include low depression angle, relatively short range, and highly competing background clutter.  The resulting research will provide a fundamental capability to predict, explain, and characterize target and background signature content, and reduce the workload on the analyst.  This research is aimed at determining the complexity and variability of target and clutter signatures and ultimately utilizing that knowledge to conceptualize and design advanced ATR paradigms to enhance robustness and effectiveness of land warfare systems.  ATR research strategies include emerging sensor modalities such as spectral and multi-sensor imaging.  Research in this Project builds knowledge for several technology efforts including multi-domain smart sensors, third generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and advanced multi-function laser radar (LADAR). \n\nWork is this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology) \/ Project 906 (Tactical Electronic Warfare Applied Research). \n \nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This research aims to generate new technologies for unprecedented battlefield situational awareness and to continue the dominance of Army units during night operations.  To achieve these objectives, IR focal plane arrays (FPAs) and lasers with significantly improved performance, lower cost, and increased operating temperatures are required.  This research has direct application to Army ground vehicles, aviation platforms, weapon systems, and the individual Soldier.  Research is focused on material growth, detector and laser design, and processing for large-area, multicolor IR FPAs, ultraviolet (UV) avalanche photodiodes (APDs), and mid-wavelength IR and UV lasers.  The principal efforts are directed towards novel materials for detectors and lasers, and investigating energy band-gap structures in semiconductor materials to enhance the performance of lasers, IR FPAs and UV APDs.  In the area of RF Photonics, near-IR modeling and nanofabrication techniques are applied to the design and fabrication of IR photonic-crystal waveguide structures having customized IR properties.  This research also is intended to lay the foundation for the development of integrated optoelectronic circuits using active and passive devices and components such as lasers, waveguides, and detectors in conjunction with fiber optic interconnects for the generation, distribution, processing, and control of microwaves.  The fundamental physics of signal processing and noise generation as well as the conversion between the time and frequency domains and the optical and electrical domains in these optoelectronic circuits\/systems will also be studied.  The technical goals are to: 1) manage and control defects in the raw, unprocessed materials, maintaining quality control in the fabrication of the devices and arrays, 2) limit introduction of impurities in the material, shielding device surfaces so that they are resistant to degradation over time and 3) thermal management, particularly as it applies to lasers.  In the area of Advanced Materials, the research is to investigate the fundamental physics of energy, charge, and spin transport along and across active heterogeneous interfaces such as topological insulators, van der Waals heterostructures, solid\/liquid interfaces, and bio\/a-bio interfaces, and in new materials to achieve new electronic\/optoelectronic device functionalities.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinning to PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology) \/ Project H95 (Night Vision and Electro-Optic Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

                            "val": "This Project focuses on research that improves Soldier-system performance in future force environments by looking at  key phenomena underlying Soldier performance such as auditory spatial orientation (e.g., perception of azimuth, elevation and distance of sounds) within uncertain, degraded acoustic conditions; extending and protecting auditory and cognitive performance; human performance in automated, mixed-initiative (human control-machine control) environments; communications in hearing-degraded conditions; visual scanning and target detection; Soldier emotion and fatigue states; integration across multiple sensory modalities; perceptual-motor behavior; collaborative (team) and independent multi-task, multi-modal, multi-echelon Soldier-system performance - all cast against the influx of emerging transformation-driven technological solutions and opportunities. Technical barriers include lack of methods for describing, measuring, modeling, analyzing and managing the interplay of these phenomena due to the dynamic nature of human behavior and to the situational complexity and ambiguity that characterize operations in the future force. Technical solutions are being pursued in the areas of data generation and algorithm development in these emerging environments in order to update and improve our understanding of performance boundaries and requirements and enable neuroengineering. These solutions include multi-disciplinary partnerships, metrics, simulation capabilities, and modeling tools for characterizing Soldier-system performance, and provide a shared conceptual and operational framework for militarily relevant research on cognitive and perceptual processes. In the area of translational neuroscience, which is the transition of basic neuroscience research to relevant applications, research is carried out to examine leading edge methodologies and technologies to improve the measurement and classification of neural states and behavior in operationally-relevant environments, to examine the potential application of neuroscience theories to autonomous systems to improve Soldier-system interactions, to model the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance for understanding individual differences and injury, and to assess how neural pathways implicated in functional processing can be enhanced through dynamic system interface technologies for improving in-theatre performance and training. In the area of cybernetics, which is a scientific discipline that bridges the fields of control theory and communication theory for the study and modeling of behavior in complex systems, research is carried out to examine the complex human-system-environment relationships that define, constrain, and influence the interactions between Soldier and system. Research efforts are pursued to advance theory, models, and methodological approaches that capture the dynamic and multidimensional nature of human behavior, including the temporal dependencies inherent to human behavior, through an integrated program of research efforts focused on: novel cybernetic models of human multisensory integration and human-system communication; neuro-inspired, bio-inspired, and engineering approaches to computational algorithms for multisensory integration and multi-sensor fusion to enable enhanced and augmented Soldier perception in human-system interactions; new methodological approaches for the design of multisensory displays and human-system communications; and multisensory test bed platforms for examining experimental hypotheses driven by model predictions and proof-of-principle applications of identified algorithms and methods.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several PEs to include PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers) \/ Project H09 (Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance) and PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology) \/ H70 (Human Factors Engineering System Development).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Technical solutions are being pursued in the areas of data generation and algorithm development in these emerging environments in order to update and improve our understanding of performance boundaries and requirements. These solutions include multi-disciplinary partnerships, metrics, simulation capabilities, and modeling tools for characterizing Soldier- system performance, and provide a shared conceptual and operational framework for militarily relevant research on critical aspects of human-agent teaming. In the area of translational neuroscience, research is carried out to examine leading edge methodologies and technologies to improve the measurement and classification of neural states and behavior in operationally-relevant environments, to examine the potential for application of neuroscience theories to autonomous systems to improve Soldier-system interactions, to model the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance for understanding individual differences and injury, and to assess how neural pathways implicated in functional processing can be enhanced through dynamic system interface technologies for improving in-theatre performance and training. In the area of cybernetics, which is a scientific discipline that bridges the fields of control theory and communication theory for the study and modeling of behavior in complex systems, research is carried out to examine the complex human-system-environment relationships that define, constrain, and influence the interactions between Soldier and system. Research efforts are pursued to advance theory, models, and methodological approaches that capture the dynamic and multidimensional nature of human behavior, including the temporal dependencies inherent to human behavior, through an integrated program of research efforts focused on: novel cybernetic models of human multisensory integration and human-system communication; neuro-inspired, bio-inspired, and engineering approaches to computational algorithms for multisensory integration and multi-sensor fusion to enable enhanced and augmented Soldier perception in human-system interactions; new methodological approaches for the design of multisensory displays and human-system communications; and multisensory test bed platforms for examining experimental hypotheses driven by model predictions and proof-of-principle applications of identified algorithms and methods.\n\nThis Project also investigates innovative theories, models, and methods to improve personnel assessment, training, and leader development, as well as provide a better understanding of individual, unit, and organizational behavior and performance within the context of complex organizational and operational environments. The research within these domains will enable advances in psychometrics to support the development of the next generation of psychological assessments for selection, classification, and assignment. The research also will target how to improve the assessment of difficult-to-measure skills and enable theoretical advances to inform and support the accelerated development of complex cognitive and social skills. This research lays the foundation for future applications that address the behavioral and organizational dynamics that impact Army flexibility, effectiveness, and resilience.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This Project focuses on technical core competencies including: Materials from Biology; Biological\/Abiological Interfaces; Systems Biology; Computational Biology; Synthetic Biology, and how those competencies address Army needs to reduce logistics burden, increase situational awareness, and improve protection.  Research will advance from manipulation of single microorganisms to designed microbial consortia for conversion of flexible feedstocks (indigenous and waste) into consistent products for energy and agile\nexpedient manufacturing; advancing from the production of individual small molecules to gradient\/precision\/ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW)\/specialty materials for production of hierarchical and metamaterials for sensing and protection; and advance from laboratory use to ruggedized organisms and materials for field deployment enabling dynamic, responsive materials, advanced sensing, and materiel protection\/denial. Further, understanding the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering and control of biological systems in military environments will allow for understanding the pacing synthetic biology threat to the future operating environment.\n \nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command (AFC).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Research involves the study of new experimental capabilities to measure, characterize, and visualize complex phenomena with high temporal and spatial resolutions as well as the development of state-of-the-art computational models that provide predictive capabilities based on at-scale and cross-scale numerical frameworks that capture the relevant physical phenomena. Research in atmospheric science seeks an in-depth understanding of the complex atmospheric boundary layer associated with high-resolution meteorology, the transport, dispersion, optical properties and characterization of chemical and biological aerosols, the propagation of full-spectrum electro-magnetic and acoustic energy and physics-based multi-scale models for electronic, optical, mechanical, and chemical materials. Efforts seek to explore methodologies and computational capabilities for the quantification of uncertainty in predictive modeling enabling risk-informed decision analysis multi-scale material models and environmental impacts on complex Army systems (manned and unmanned). This research also conducts research in chemistry and physics controlling ballistic propulsion and launch; creating aerodynamic forces on flight bodies to permit radical maneuver at high speeds, and high altitude glide and flight maneuver for increased range of gun launched projectiles.  This research results in knowledge products that lead to new materials for armor and armaments, disruptive explosives and propellants, more accurate and non-lethal (NL)\/lethal projectiles and missiles, omnisonic maneuver of projectiles, and advanced armors for increased survivability of Army combat systems. This research also funds efforts in the characterization of chemical and biochemical phenomena occurring at or near solid surfaces and interfaces; the interactions between chemical reactions and transport processes on surfaces; theory and modeling of processes at complex surfaces; and the synthesis and characterization of catalysts that function at the nanoscale. Investment in basic research centered on the surface science disciplines will enable growth of a knowledge base that will result in improved understanding of the interactions of complex materials in real world environments.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings for several PEs to include PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology); 0602146A (Networks C3I Technology); 0602147A (Long Range Precision Fires); PE 0602141A (Lethality Technology), PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

As the combat force structure decreases and operates in more dispersed formations, information systems must be more robust, intelligent, interoperable, and survivable if the Army is to retain both information and maneuver dominance. This research addresses the areas of information assurance, signal processing for wireless battlefield communications, information extraction from multi-modal data human-agent naturalistic communication, and intelligent systems for C4I. Research will focus on understanding and solving inherent vulnerabilities associated with using standardized protocols and commercial technologies while addressing survivability in a unique hostile military environment that includes highly mobile nodes and infrastructure, bandwidth-constrained communications at the edge, resource-constrained sensor networks, diverse networks with dynamic topologies, high-level multi-path interference and fading, jamming and multi-access interference, levels of noise in speech signals and document images, and information warfare threats. These C4I technologies must accommodate heterogeneous security infrastructures, multi-service and multi-national interoperability, and information exchange\/security mechanisms between multiple levels of security. The intelligent systems for C4I research focuses on providing machine learning methods to overcome noisy, sparse and heterogeneous data with artificial intelligence algorithms that can transfer learning from one domain to another. This foundational research will produce help identifying highly relevant tactical events for mounted or dismounted commanders, leaders and Soldiers; improve the timeliness, quality and effectiveness of actions; and speed the decision-making process of small teams operating in complex natural or urban terrain.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the theoretical underpinnings for PE 0602146A (Networks C3I Technology), 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) and 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.  \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Problems addressed include the need for greater fuel efficiency and reduced weight in these propulsion systems.  Technical barriers to advanced propulsion systems are the inadequacy of existing materials to safely withstand higher temperature demands, the lack of capability to accurately simulate the flow physics and the mechanical behavior of these systems, including the engine and drive train.  The Army is the lead Service in these technology areas and performs basic research in propulsion, as applicable to rotorcraft as well as tracked and wheeled vehicles.  Technical solutions are being pursued through analysis, code generation, and evaluations to improve engine and drive train components and investigate advanced materials.  Component level investigations include compressors, combustors, turbines, energy sources and conversion, injectors, pistons, cylinder liners, piston rings, gears, seals, bearings, shafts, and controls.\n\nWork in this Project provides the technical underpinnings for PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

As the combat force structure decreases and operates in more dispersed formations, information systems must be more robust, intelligent, interoperable, and survivable if the Army is to retain both information and maneuver dominance.  This research supports the Army's Network Science initiative and addresses the areas of information assurance, signal processing for wireless battlefield communications, document and speech machine translation, and intelligent systems for C4I.  Major barriers to achieving the goals are the inherent vulnerabilities associated with using standardized protocols and commercial technologies while addressing survivability in a unique hostile military environment that includes highly mobile nodes and infrastructure, bandwidth-constrained communications at lower echelons, resource-constrained sensor networks, diverse networks with dynamic topologies, high-level multi-path interference and fading, jamming and multi-access interference, levels of noise in speech signals and document images, new low-density languages, and information warfare threats.  These C4I technologies must accommodate heterogeneous security infrastructures and information exchange\/security mechanisms between multiple levels of security.  The intelligent systems for C4I research focuses on providing the agent technology capabilities that will produce highly relevant tactical events for mounted or dismounted commanders, leaders and Soldiers; improve the timeliness, quality and effectiveness of actions; and speed the decision-making process of small teams operating in complex natural or urban terrain.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology) \/ Project Y10 (Computer\/Information Science Technology).\n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This research also enables the design and use of composite structures that can better address the cost, weight, performance, and dynamic interaction requirements of future platforms identified by the Army Modernization Strategy.  Ultimately, these technologies result in safer, more affordable vehicles with a greatly reduced logistics footprint.  This Project is a collaborative Army and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) effort that includes structures technology research into: structural integrity analyses; failure criteria; inspection methods which address fundamental technology deficiencies in both metallic and composite Army rotorcraft structures; use of composite materials in the design and control of structures through structural tailoring techniques; rotorcraft aeroelastic modeling and simulation; helicopter vibration (rotating and fixed systems); and the design and analyses of composite structures with crashworthiness as a goal.  The problems in structural modeling are inaccurate structural analysis and validation methods to predict durability and damage tolerance of composite and metallic rotorcraft structures and inadequate structural dynamics modeling methods for both the rotating and fixed system components to address reliability issues for future aircraft.  The technical barriers include a lack of understanding of failure mechanisms, damage progression, residual strength, high-cycle fatigue, the transfer of aerodynamic loads on the rotor to the fixed system, and impact of these unknown loads on aircraft components.  Technical solutions are focused on: advanced fatigue methodologies for metallic structures, improved composites technology throughout the vehicle, long-term investigation of integrated stress-strength-inspection, advanced methods for rotor system vehicle vibratory loads prediction, improved methods to predict vehicle stability, and improved analyses to address Army Aviation requirements.  These advancements will extend service life, reduce maintenance costs, enhance durability, and reduce the logistics footprint of existing and future Army vehicles.  This is the only basic research Project supporting investigations for rotorcraft and ground vehicle structures within the Department of Defense.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology). \n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Work in pollution prevention invests in next generation manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal methods that will result in significantly reducing the usage of hazardous and toxic substances and their associated costs.  The goal is to decrease the overall life-cycle costs of Army systems by 15-30% through the application of advanced pollution prevention technologies.  Non-stockpile CW efforts include establishing the ecotoxicity of CW compounds, environmental fate and effect of CW compounds in soils and biodegradation of CW compounds.  Pollution prevention thrusts include: environmentally acceptable, advanced, non-toxic processes to manufacture lightweight alternative structural materials to enhance weapon system survivability; clean synthesis of more powerful and improved energetic compounds to eliminate the use of hazardous materials and minimize the generation of wastes; and surface protection alternatives to hazardous paints, cadmium, chromium, and chromate conversion metal and composite surfaces.  \n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with the Army Environmental Requirements Technology Assessment (AERTA) requirements and contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments.  \n\nThe cited work provides the technical underpinnings for PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology).\n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

It enables future systems to support and unburden Soldiers by integrating technologies with an understanding of cognitive and physical needs, and the missions of the humans and (non-human) agents operating on the battlefield.  The ability of the Warfighter to command a suite of small unmanned systems (e.g., air, ground, and hybrid vehicles) reduces exposure of the Soldier to harm and improves the efficiency by which a dismounted unit achieves tactical objectives such as securing a targeted zone.  Example missions requiring enhanced autonomy, manipulation, and man-portability include rapid room clearing and interior structure mapping; detection of human presence, chemical\/biological\/nuclear\/radiological\/explosive (CBNRE), and booby-traps; surveillance; and subterranean passage detection and exploration.  Because of their relatively small size, light weight, and service in dismounted environments, small unmanned systems have unique challenges in perception, autonomous processing, mobility mechanics, propulsive power, and multi-functional packaging that transcend similar challenges associated with large unmanned systems.  The Army Futures Command  conducts research in related disciplines, including machine perception, intelligent control, biomimetic robotics, manipulator mechanics, and propulsive power and drives to foster the development of technologies for lightweight, small-volume, robotics applications for harsh environments.  Machine perception research includes the exploration of lightweight ultra-compact sensor phenomenology and the maturation of basic machine vision algorithms that enable small unmanned systems to more fully understand their local environment.  Intelligent control research includes the maturation of autonomous processing capabilities and the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques that lead to reliable autonomous behavior in a large-displacement, highly-dynamic environment and permit unmonitored task performance.  Research in biomimetic robotics and manipulator mechanics includes the advancement of mechatronic and biomimetic appendages to enable agile high-speed locomotion, dexterous task-performance, and environmental-manipulation; and the maturing of nonlinear control algorithms to support robust, stable mobility. Propulsion power research includes investigations of engine cycles and alternative hybrid energy conversion techniques to provide compact, lightweight, quiet, low-emission, high-density power sources that support highly-portable unmanned systems capable of performing long-endurance missions.  \n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

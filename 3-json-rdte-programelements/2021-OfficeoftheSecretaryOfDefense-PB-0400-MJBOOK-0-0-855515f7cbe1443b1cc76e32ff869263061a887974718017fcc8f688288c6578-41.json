The HD R&D Program coordinates with SHA and the with Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) programs of the Geographical Combatant Commands (CCMD) to develop, demonstrate and validate cost-effective technologies for use in humanitarian demining via OCONUS operational field evaluations. The HD R&D Program\u2019s low-cost and highly effective technology reduces landmine and UXO threat to the local population and US forces, and bolsters host nations\u2019 mine action capacity while improving DoD\u2019s visibility and access, generating long-term positive perceptions of DoD and the USG, and fostering collaborative relationships with host nation governments.  The program directly supports the National Defense Strategy through ensuring common domains remain open and free.\n\nThe HD R&D Program crafts a research and development plan based on CCMDs\u2019 security cooperation and theater campaign plan objectives to advance the state-of-the-art of demining technology and evaluate prototype technology utilizing host nation humanitarian demining operations partners.  Continuous operations test data against live mines\/UXO around the world is unavailable to any other DoD organization. Such data informs HD R&D Program investment decisions and is leveraged by U.S. military countermine R&D programs to improve U.S. forces\u2019 technology.  In addition, the program conducts mine and UXO detector training at the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) in support of mil-to-mil training and partnerships.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 227 evaluations in 42 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Zimbabwe.  The program\u2019s technologies have cleared 66.8 million square meters of the world\u2019s toughest minefields, and found or destroyed 205,474 mines and UXO.\n\nNew technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop and a biennial UXO Working Group Meeting held by OASD SO\/LIC.  The meetings involve representatives from Department of State (DOS), CCMD Humanitarian Mine Action programs, international mine action organizations and mine-affected nations.  The program element\u2019s work fulfills the Department of Defense\u2019s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with \u00a7 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance."

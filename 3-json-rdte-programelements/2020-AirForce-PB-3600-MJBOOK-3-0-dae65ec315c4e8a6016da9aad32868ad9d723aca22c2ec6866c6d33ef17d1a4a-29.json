            "val": "This program element funds related Air Force projects sharing the RQ-4 platform in common: the RQ-4 Block 30, the RQ-4 Block 40, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, and Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP). The RQ-4 Block 30 and Block 40 projects support the development and testing of the ACAT 1C RQ-4 capability and the initiation of the major modification ACAT programs. The majority of the modernization funding was transferred to the Capability Enhancement project (675149) to support upgrades and modifications, including established ACAT I and II programs, to the fielded RQ-4 weapon system to meet evolving threats and warfighter requirements. The MP-RTIP project completes development and testing of the baseline MDAP MP-RTIP sensor capability.\n\nWhen judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.\n\nPer direction of USD(AT&L), the RQ-4 program was restructured from the original project 675144 (Baseline) into multiple projects: (1) Block 30, (2) Block 40, (3) GroundSegment\/Communications System, and (4) Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA). In FY17 the Ground Segment\/Communications System project (675147) ended. Prior year funds in the amount of $2031.377M were accounted for in project 675144 and $85.375M were accounted for in project 675147.\n\nThe FY2018 funding was increased by $8.000 million to develop a Block 40 ISR Payload Adapter design and documentation.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

RDT&E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for Block 30 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) sensors, the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP), and alternate sensor payloads.\n\nThis funding also supports aircraft systems upgrades to include continuing airframe updates, aircraft operations surety, cybersecurity, airspace and interoperability enhancements, information assurance, and mission critical repair of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).\n\nActivities include mission planning interoperability enhancements, weather capability enhancements and testing, airspace and interoperability enhancements and updates, airframe and software upgrades and deficiency report resolution across RQ-4 fleet, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, sensor interoperability and communication enhancements and alternate sensor upgrades, upgrades to ASIP Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) sensor, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) development and testing, development and testing activities associated with enhancing sensor capability and sensor integration, integration of alternate sensors, development and testing of ice protection system, support of demonstration\/development and technology insertion, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  \n\nThis project supports system engineering\/program management, test and evaluation, management services, and fielding support for all RQ-4 projects.  This reflects contracting\/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program to provide efficiencies.\n\nThe RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20\/30\/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation & Dissemination (PED) elements.  The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nWhen judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards."

The Block 40 program provides critical Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data to the warfighter. This funding also supports continued aircraft\/communications systems upgrade to include Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5\/Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), mission planning upgrade development and testing, airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, enhanced weather capability, development and testing of ice protection system, additional radar modes, sensor enhancements, reliability and maintainability improvements, Airframe improvements to support alternate sensors, and support of demonstration and technology insertion. Funding continues RQ-4 unique development and integration of upgraded capabilities. \n\nWhen judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.\n\nThe RQ-4 program will maintain capability and interoperability for Block 40 including efforts with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation & Dissemination (PED) elements.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis, support to future system enhancements, communication and interoperability enhancements, current and future program planning, and project execution."

RDT&E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for RQ-4 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for current and  alternate sensor payloads.\n\nThis funding also supports aircraft systems upgrades to include continuing airframe updates, aircraft operations surety, cybersecurity, airspace and interoperability enhancements, information assurance, and mission critical repair of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  This project will include systems engineering\/program management, configuration and data management, test and evaluation, management services, Deficiency Report (DR)\/Military Intelligence Program (MIP) Investigations, studies and analysis and fielding support for Block 30, Block 40, and Ground Segment\/Communication Systems.\n\nActivities include airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, airframe and software upgrades, effort to bring early production aircraft to current operational configurations, deficiency report resolution across RQ-4 fleet, sensor enhancements and alternate sensor upgrades including the MS-177 and the Optical Bar Camera (OBC), ISR Payload Adapter, enhanced communications capabilities, support for demonstration and technology insertion, development and testing of ice protection system, enhanced mission flexibility to accommodate changes to mission objectives inflight, enhancements to support multi-domain contested environment operations, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  Additionally, this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 20\/30\/40 aircraft, including further development, mode creation, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities, continued aircraft\/communications systems upgrade, increased power generation, additional radar modes, reliability and maintainability improvements, Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) efforts, as well as next-generation communications capabilities. GSMP resolves fleet grounding Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence issues associated with ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as building-based multi-aircraft control. It will also enhance interoperability data dissemination as well as provide training capability. CSMP resolves critical DMS and obsolescence issues in the RQ-4 communication infrastructure and provides enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network.\n\nRDT&E funding in this project also supports design, development, integration and testing of the weapon system's legacy ground elements and communications capabilities to enhance functionality and maintain interoperability prior to GSMP\/CSMP fielding.  The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Elements (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Elements (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence information while remaining compliant with DoD cybersecurity network requirements to operate in the DoD Information Network (DoDIN).\n\nThis project supports system engineering\/program management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for all RQ-4 projects.  This reflects contracting\/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program to provide efficiencies.  \n\nThe RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20\/30\/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation & Dissemination (PED) elements. The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nWhen judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards."

MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.\n\nThis project (67RTIP) includes MP-RTIP modernization and integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 Platform. MP-RTIP modernization studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), Maritime Inverse SAR(MISAR), product improvements and other advanced capabilities. GH Program Office will continue integration of radar capabilities to include Maritime Modes integration into RQ-4 aircraft and ground systems. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MPRTIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F,0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

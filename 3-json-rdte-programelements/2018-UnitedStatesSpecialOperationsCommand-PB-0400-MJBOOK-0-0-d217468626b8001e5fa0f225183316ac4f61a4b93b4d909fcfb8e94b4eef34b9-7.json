            "val": "Aviation Systems Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection (LPI\/LPD) Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance (TF\/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser (HEL); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.  \n\nCV-22 Development:\nThe CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF\/TA (Silent Knight) radar program provides long-range, night\/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable\/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following\/avoidance radar.\n\nMission Training and Preparation Systems:\nThe Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. \n\nAC\/MC-130J:\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging\/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.\n\nRotary Wing Aviation:\nThis project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters."

The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.\n\nSpecial Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J Gunship configuration. The AC-130J aircraft perform close air support (CAS), air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance missions.  The MC-130J aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.\n\nAviation Systems funds develop, integrate, and test aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN), electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits. Provides PSP aircraft infrastructure development."

                            "val": "This project develops\/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, improved lethality and enhanced aircraft self-protection. Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A\/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022  A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification and\/or airframe replacement will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main\/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components to the extent possible and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A\/MH-6M aircraft operational through FY 2020 and beyond or until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.\n\n\u2022  MH-60M Modification and Upgrades develops technologies to improve safety of the MH-60 and decrease operational costs. Efforts include, but are not limited to, DOD MH-60 engineering changes, product improvements to SOF unique equipment and munitions during testing. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.\n\n\u2022  MH-60M Block Upgrades provides the development, integration, and qualification efforts on the MH-60 helicopter to include flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. \n\n\u2022  Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aircrew.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in Degraded Visual Environments. This program addresses SOF-unique requirements for rapid fielding and weight limitations, capitalizes on the unique skills of the SOF aviator while integrating with SOF-unique avionics, and leverages existing sensors on SOF aircraft to the maximum extent possible.\n\n \u2022  Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the service-common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-unique modifications to the common aircraft.\n\n\u2022  Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) capability suitable for the A\/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird with potential use on the MH-60 and MH-47 aircraft. The IRCM program will integrate and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system and countermeasure capability and infrared suppressor. The A\/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the SOF inventory without protection from infrared guided and other advanced Man Portable Air Defense missiles.\n\n\u2022  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS) and Engine Barrier Filter. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats and enhance aircraft self-protection.\n\n\u2022  Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) program provides for non-recurring engineering (NRE), systems engineering\/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System.  This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit: (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Situational Awareness for Safe Aircraft Recovery provides passive survivability for flight operations in all weather conditions by providing three-dimensional displays with flight path guidance to increase battle space awareness in zero-visibility conditions; (3) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces instantaneously adjusting an aircraft\u2019s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions.\n\n\u2022  Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program improves targeting, tracking, and aircrew situational awareness on ARSOA platforms. This program mitigates obsolescence and increases functionality on the light and heavy assault platforms within the ARSOA fleet.\n\n\u2022  The Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Upgrades program develops, integrates, and tests critical active and passive SOF-unique aircraft survivability equipment to counter the acknowledged high proliferation of advanced Surface-to-Air (SA) threat systems for the A\/MH-6, MH-60, and MH-47.  Additionally, these threat systems are technically evolving at an unprecedented rate, requiring rapid counter system development and immediate spiraled improvements that will reduce the probability of successful engagement, increase the probability of detecting and countering threat systems, and improve the aircraft's ability to continue operating after sustained battle damage.  This program includes development and testing of both new systems and pre-planned product improvements\/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment, flares, and associated qualification testing.\n\n\u2022  Secure Real Time Video (SRTV) ensures that while en route to an objective, SOF aircrews and operators have access to the latest data collected on the objective enabling them to maintain situational awareness and improve survivability.  This project will integrate and test software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time full motion video intelligence."

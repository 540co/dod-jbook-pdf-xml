The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battle space focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness. \n\nThis Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).

Technical efforts are focused on advancing perception for autonomous ground and air mobility, intelligent vehicle control and behaviors, human-robot interaction, robotic manipulation, and improved mobility for unmanned vehicles of scales from micro-systems through tactical combat vehicles. The Project provides the underpinning research of the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA), a cooperative arrangement with industry and academia to conduct a concerted, collaborative effort advancing key enabling robotic technologies required for future unmanned systems.  The Robotics CTA research is funded in PE0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers) \/ Project H09 (Robotics CTA). \n\nThis Project leverages basic research conducted under PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences) \/ Project T63 (Robotics Autonomy, Manipulation and Portability Rsh) and PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers \/ Project H09 (Robotics CTA) and transitions knowledge and emerging technologies to PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology) for maturation and demonstration.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering focus areas, and the Army Modernization Strategy.  The Ground Portfolio technology investments are improving logistics throughput and surge capability supporting maneuver forces (Leader-Follower technology) and allow experimentation with manned and unmanned teams to develop the advantages that inform\/protect the maneuver force.\n\nFY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities."

            "val": "The activities described in this PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nActivities and efforts in this PE address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications\/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) Weather Systems is a component of SBEM\nefforts to develop capabilities to satisfy weather Gap 1 (Cloud Characterization) and Gap 2 (Theater Weather Imagery). The earliest possible launch options are being\nintegrated in the design for critical gaps.\nBased on the SBEM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) results, the EO\/IR Weather Systems (EWS) initial thrusts will enable:\n1) DoD use of data collected by civil, international and other DoD space systems;\n2) Timely weather collection of EWS Program of Record;\n3) Explore and\/or utilize the use of commercially available data.\nSecondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the SBEM AoA and validated by the JROC.\nEWS will consist of a Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) Freeflyer space vehicle in a sun-synchronous, early morning orbit and a ground architecture (LEO Ground) for mission\ndata retrieval\/processing and telemetry, tracking, and control. EWS will provide environmental monitoring in the Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) Family of Systems\nproviding coverage to meet Space Based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM) Gaps 1 and 2, Cloud Characterization (CC) and Theater Weather Imagery (TWI).\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and\nimplementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships,\nand managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition\nauthorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop\nnew or repurpose capabilities.\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EWS weapon system capability. The use of such program\nfunds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F."

LAA executes under a middle tier rapid fielding acquisition strategy pursuant to Section 804 of the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act. The LAA option offers flexibility and accelerates modernization of current and potential partner forces who do not require advanced fighter aircraft. The LAA effort supports the National Defense Strategy to counter violent extremism on a global scale, alongside allies and partners.\n\nLAA squadrons will provide a deployable and sustainable multirole attack capability, capable of performing a diverse array of attack missions, including but not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Armed Reconnaissance, Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR), Airborne Forward Air control (FAC-A), and Interdiction. Other tasks for which Light Attack aircraft is expected to be suitable include Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Rescue Escort (RESCORT), and Maritime Air Support (MAS). LAA squadrons executing these tasks allows our 4th and 5th Generation fighter fleets to implement a tailored training regimen to address declining core mission readiness and focus on preparing to deter or prevail in conflicts with peer adversaries. LAA will provide a deployable, persistent attack capability that can be employed with low footprint and light logistical support requirements.\n\nPhase III of the Light Attack experiment will seek to identify, assess and mature tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for coalition low-end counter-land operations, and assess TTPs using various networked capability packages while measuring the success and timeliness of \"find-fix-track-target-engage-assess\u201d (F2T2EA) operations.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the Light Attack weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F"

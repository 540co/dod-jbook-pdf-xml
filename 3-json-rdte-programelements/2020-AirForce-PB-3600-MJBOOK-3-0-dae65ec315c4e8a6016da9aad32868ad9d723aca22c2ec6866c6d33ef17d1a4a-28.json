            "val": "Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system architecture for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time- sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT network linked weapon system (AN\/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites, and other collection systems. AF DCGS is designed to support joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements. Currently, the AF DCGS worldwide architecture is composed of two worldwide core sites, three regional core sites, two remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, four National Mission Partner (NMP) sites, three support sites, and multiple National Guard Bureau (NGB) sites. Currently, AF DCGS is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance by providing quality and fused Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.\n\nAF DCGS is transforming by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs. These efforts will also integrate commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services. The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and\/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as enhance interoperability by migrating to an Open Architecture (OA) to improve data sharing ability per DoD direction.\n\nProgram management consists of five ACAT III efforts: GEOINT Transformation, SIGINT Transformation, Multi-INT, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT): (Note: GEOINT Baseline 4.1, System Release 3.0 and SENSORS ACAT were closed in FY18 and Sensors funding\/projects were merged into GEOINT Transformation ACAT in FY19).\n\nPage 2\n1. GEOINT Transformation: The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities, enables quick\/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, command and control (C2) and migrates GEOINT-specific applications & capabilities into the open architecture framework.\n2. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrate new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications\/capabilities into the open architecture framework.\n3. Multi-INT: Rapidly integrate new multi-INT capabilities\/enterprise applications and facilitate enterprise-wide collaboration capabilities. Addresses program office test and evaluation activities.\n4. Network Infrastructure Transformation: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, cloud-enabled hybrid Platform as a Service, improving data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery.  Initial OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture, represents the AF DCGS program's initial efforts to eventually migrate to a hybrid cloud (mix of private on-premises and public cloud) architecture \n5. *DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.\n\nNOTES:\n*For FY20, this effort does not have any associated investment funding.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrate new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications\/capabilities into the open architecture framework.\n3. Multi-INT: Rapidly integrate new multi-INT capabilities\/enterprise applications and facilitate enterprise-wide collaboration capabilities. Addresses program office test and evaluation activities.\n4. Network Infrastructure Transformation: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, cloud-enabled hybrid Platform as a Service, improving data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery.  Initial OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture, represents the AF DCGS program's initial efforts to eventually migrate to a hybrid cloud (mix of private on-premises and public cloud) architecture \n5. *DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.\n\nNOTES:\n*For FY20, this effort does not have any associated RDT&E funding. The Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) funding is exhibited in the Procurement Documentation (WSC846080, DCGS-AF).\n\nIntelligent Modeling and Predictive Analysis of Cyberspace Targeting (IMPACT) (Formerly known as Project SUTER) effort was moved from PE 0305221F to PE 0305208F in FY19. IMPACT develops concepts, Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS weapon system capability.

Funds are necessary to update current government-owned software to ingest and disseminate new data sources from Title 10 and Title 50 sensors.  The DIFC efforts at COCOM sponsored experimentation events will inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations.\n\nMission Assurance (MA) is a DoD risk management effort, driven by DODD 3020.40 that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions.  \"DoD will continue, under the MA construct and policy, existing efforts to meet national and Defense Critical Infrastructure (DCI) requirements established by PPD-21.  Existing Department-level Defense Critical Infrastructure Program policy will remain effective until integrated into, replaced, or rescinded by MA policy.  DoD Components will maintain sufficient resources to meet DCI responsibilities for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risk to critical infrastructure and align associated security, protection, and risk management efforts under an MA construct.\u201d  Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links.  The USSTRATCOM Defense Critical Infrastructure Protection program (DCIP) is a risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to USSTRATCOM and other DoD missions.  Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links. DCIP is directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense & Americas' Security Affairs) [OASD (HD&ASA)].  DCIP manages the identification, prioritization, assessment, and assurance of Critical Infrastructure as a comprehensive program that includes the development of adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk, restore capability in the event of loss or degradation, support incident management, and protect defense critical infrastructure.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

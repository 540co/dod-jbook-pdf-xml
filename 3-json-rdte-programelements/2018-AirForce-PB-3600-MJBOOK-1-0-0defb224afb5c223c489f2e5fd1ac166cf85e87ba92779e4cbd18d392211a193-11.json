The program was devolved from OSD in FY12 to achieve efficiencies in program management.  TechLink, DoD\u2019s first National level Partnership Intermediary (PI), was established by OSD in 1999 to provide direct Technology Transfer support to all Air Force, Army, Navy, and independent DoD Research Laboratories.  TechLink is a performance based, metrics-driven organization.\n\nThe mission of Technology Transfer is to: (1) Establish license agreements to transfer patented inventions from DoD research laboratories to industry for conversion into new dual-use products and services to support DoD\u2019s defense mission and benefit the US economy; and (2) Establish collaborative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with the private-sector for development of new, innovative, dual-use technology.  Both of these activities enable DoD to leverage the investment and capabilities of the private-sector in development of new defense-related products and services, lowering DoD costs and also helping ensure that DoD-developed or co-developed technologies are transitioned to DoD operational use.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

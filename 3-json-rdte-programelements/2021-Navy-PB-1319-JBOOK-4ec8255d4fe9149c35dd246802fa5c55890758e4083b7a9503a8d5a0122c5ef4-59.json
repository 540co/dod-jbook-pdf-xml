            "val": "Future Vertical Lift (Maritime Strike) (FVL (MS)) directs a Naval Aviation initiative to close key warfighting gaps and recapitalize capabilities lost when legacy rotary wing platforms (MQ-8C, MH-60S, and MH-60R) reach service-life limits beginning in the late 2020s.  The FVL (MS) program will develop and field more capable, maintainable and reliable manned and unmanned rotorcraft systems to meet the needs of the Navy.  FVL (MS) will be a key component of Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) which will add warfighting capabilities in long-range Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&T), Surface Warfare, Undersea Warfare (Anti-Submarine Warfare and Mine Warfare), Air Warfare, Electronic Warfare, Naval Special Warfare, Personnel Recovery, Patient Movement, Humanitarian Assistance\/Disaster Relief and Combat Logistics. \nThe activities conducted under this program will contribute to the acquisition documentation required to support a Milestone A (MS-A) decision and enable Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) key activities.  These efforts will enable timely development of a system that provides best value and capability to the warfighter while maintaining effective and efficient war fighting capability in support of the Navy's 30-year Aviation Plan.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under ADVANCED COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPES because it includes all efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Specific development activities required for FVL (MS) include: capability requirements definition, documentation, and validation; Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) planning and execution including AoA Study Guidance and Study Plan preparation); completion of affordability studies; establishment of the appropriate security environment (e.g. computers, facilities, and administration); production of an Acquisition Strategy (AS), Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE), Life Cycle Support Plan (LCSP), Systems Engineering Plan (SEP), and Draft Capability Development Document (CDD); Request for Proposal (RFP) development: acquisition documentation; risk reduction initiatives; design trade studies; and support to joint FVL, including open hardware and software reference and objective architectures definition, mission system interoperability, and shipboard compatibility.  These activities will result in completion of all acquisition documentation required for Milestone-A in FY 2024. Follow-on activities support preparation and execution of efforts to develop common systems reference and objective open architectures, and eventual prototype aircraft flight demonstrations in support of the FVL Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction acquisition phase.  Activities and technologies developed also have the potential to be leveraged for sustainment of legacy Navy helicopters.  These efforts will enable timely development of a system that provides best value and capability to the Joint Warfighter while maintaining effective and efficient war fighting capability in support of the Navy's 30 year Aviation Plan.  \n\nFY 2021 budget request funds the initial support for FVL (MS) AoA to assess the technical feasibility, technical risk, and affordability of potential strategic solutions with the intent to develop the next generation of Naval rotary wing aircraft systems.  Tasks to be performed include but are not limited to: AoA support, acquisition program management functions, establishment of the security environment, engineering modeling and analysis, TEMP development, system specification and Draft CDD development and design trade studies."

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) fosters university and industry based research to provide a scientific foundation for enabling technologies for future force capabilities.  Broadly, the work in this PE falls into three categories: Collaborative Technology Alliances \/ Collaborative Research Alliances (CTAs\/CRAs), University Centers of Excellence (COE), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs).  The Army formed CTAs to leverage large investments by the commercial sector in basic research areas that are of great interest to the Army.  CTAs are industry-led partnerships between industry, academia, and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to incorporate the practicality of industry, the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge from universities, and Army scientists to shape, mature, and transition technology relevant to the Army mission.  CTAs have been competitively established in the areas of Micro Autonomous Systems Technology (MAST), Network Sciences, Robotics, and Cognition and Neuroergonomics. CRAs are academia-led partnerships, which leverage the cutting-edge innovation found in the academic environment.  CRAs have been established in the areas of Multi-Scale Materials Modeling (electronic materials and materials in extreme environments) and in cyber security.  The COEs focus on expanding the frontiers of knowledge in research areas where the Army has enduring needs, and couples state-of-the-art research programs at academic institutions with broad-based graduate education programs to increase the supply of scientists and engineers in automotive and rotary wing technology.  Also included are Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) and activities to stimulate interest in science, math, and technology among middle and high school students.  This PE includes support for basic research at three Army UARCs, which have been created to exploit opportunities to advance new capabilities through a sustained long-term multidisciplinary effort.  The Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies focuses on Soldier protection by emphasizing revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies focuses on enabling network centric-technologies, and broadening the Army's use of biotechnology for the development of bio-inspired materials, sensors, and information processing.  The Institute for Creative Technologies is a partnership with academia and the entertainment and gaming industries to leverage innovative research and concepts for training and simulation.  Examples of specific research of mutual interest to the entertainment industry and the Army are technologies for realistic immersion in synthetic environments, networked simulation, standards for interoperability, and tools for creating simulated environments.  This PE also includes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institution (HBCU\/MI) Centers of Excellence that address critical research areas for Army Transformation. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n \nWork in this PE is performed by the ARL in Adelphi, MD; the Army Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) in Warren, MI; the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), in Huntsville, AL, and the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), in Aberdeen, MD."

This CRA consists of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments.  This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of cyber security and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network.  The three aspects of cyber that are addressed are: 1) vulnerabilities and risks of cyber networks to malicious activities, 2) anticipating, detecting, and analyzing malicious activities, and 3) agile cyber maneuver to thwart and defeat malicious activities.  Overarching goals of cyber security are to significantly decrease the adversary's return on investment when considering cyber attack on Army networks, and minimizing the impact on (Army) network performance related to implementing cyber security.  The CRA research creates a framework that effectively integrates the knowledge of cyber assets and potential adversary capabilities and approaches, and provides defense mechanisms that dynamically adjust to changes related to mission, assets, vulnerability state, and defense mechanisms.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology)\/Project H92 (Communications Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi and Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD."

Escalating levels of complexity and uncertainty on the current and future battlefield present conditions which have never existed before now.  Solution strategies and approaches must be developed or tailored.  The emerging field of neuroergonomics, which seeks to understand the brain at work and to leverage that understanding to optimize system design, offers tremendous potential for providing the solutions needed to meet the needs of Army forces in the future.  This CTA addresses the solution strategies and approaches needed to design systems to fully exploit investments in revolutionary technological advances in areas such as robotics, microelectronics, and computer and network information systems.  These technologies present significant opportunities to enhance Army mission capabilities, but impose significant burdens on the human brain, which will ultimately limit Soldier-system effectiveness, sustainability, and survivability.  The technical barriers associated with this project include: immature knowledge base to guide the neuroergonomic approach to human-system integration; inadequate capabilities to sense and extract information about brain activity in dynamic, operational environments; lack of valid measures to robustly and uniquely characterize operationally-relevant cognitive performance; lack of techniques for integrating advanced understandings of brain activity into systems designs, including real-time use of measures of cognitive behavior as system inputs and the capability to account for individual differences in maximizing Soldier-system performance.  This CTA conducts an intensive and accelerated program to formulate, validate, and transition basic research findings through multi-dimensional approaches focused in three areas: understanding fundamental principles underlying Soldier neurocognitive performance in operational environments, advancing computational approaches for the analysis and interpretation of neural functioning, and fundamental advancement in neurotechnologies that enhance Soldier-system interactions and performance. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD."

The CRA will facilitate collaboration across organizations to provide multi-disciplinary perspectives on basic research challenges, as well as the use of state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations.  This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of pervasive and converged cyber-physical complex information systems and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the information-theoretic and human elements of Army IoBT interactions.  The three aspects of the emergent Internet of Battlefield Things topical areas addressed are: 1) dynamic discovery and adaptation of cyber-physical devices, networks, and information sources, 2) resilient re-purposing and re-tasking of devices and information capabilities, and 3) algorithmic, distributed and centralized information-stream processing.  Overarching goals of the basic research on Army IoBT are to investigate foundational cross-cutting theories and methods leading towards a science of heterogeneous, self-adapting, complex cyber-physical systems.  This research will lead to optimized real-time adversarial situation estimates in information-enabled warfare and greatly enhance the speed and precision for complex military operations involving converged sensing, communications, and resilient actuation.\n\nWork in this Project builds fundamental knowledge for and accelerates the transition of communications and networks technology to Program Element (PE) 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology).  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the ARL in Adelphi, MD."

The ICB was established as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to support leveraging biotechnology for: advanced sensors; new electronic, magnetic, and optical materials; and information processing and bioinspired network analysis. The objective is to perform sustained multidisciplinary basic research supporting technology to provide the Army with biomolecular sensor platforms with unprecedented sensitivity, reliability, and durability; higher-order arrays of functional electronic and optoelectronic components capable of self-assembly and with multi-functions; and new biological means to process, integrate, and network information.  These sensor platforms will incorporate proteomics (large scale study of proteins) technology, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence identification and detection tools, and the capability for recognition of viral pathogens.  A second ICB objective is to educate and train outstanding students and post-doctoral researchers in revolutionary areas of science to support Army Transformation.  The ICB has many industrial partners, such as International Business Machine (IBM) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), and has strong collaborations with Argonne, Lawrence Berkley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Sandia National Laboratories, the Army's Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, the Institute for Creative Technologies, and Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) laboratories.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this Project is performed extramurally by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD."

The ITCs perform identification and evaluation of international technology programs to assess their potential impact on the Army's S&T investment strategy.  ITC 'technology finds' are submitted as technology information papers (TIPs) to various Army S&T organizations for evaluation and consideration for further research and development.  The FTAS program builds upon the TIPs submitted by the ITCs.  In some cases the TIP is truly unique and may well meet an Army requirement or potentially support ongoing Army S&T investments.  In such cases, the FTAS program can provide initial resources (seed money) to fund basic research in these technology areas identified by the TIPs as having potential relevance to the Army.  The research will provide information useful in making early assessments of the technology's potential contributions to the Army's S&T strategy.  \n\nWork in this Project related to the United States Military Academy (USMA) Basic Research Center for Network Science is fully coordinated with and complementary to Program Element (PE) 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers)\/Project H50 (Network Science CTA). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus.\n       \nWork in this Project is performed by Headquarters, Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD."

The ISN was established as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to support research to devise nanotechnology-based solutions for the Soldier.  The ISN emphasizes revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The ISN works in close collaboration with the United States (U.S.) Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), and other U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) elements, as well as several major industrial partners, including Raytheon and DuPont, in pursuit of its goals.  This project emphasizes revolutionary materials research toward an advanced uniform concept.  The future uniform will integrate a wide range of functionality, including ballistic protection, responsive passive cooling and insulating, screening of chemical and biological agents, biomedical monitoring, performance enhancement, and extremities protection.  The objective is to lighten the Soldier's load through system integration and multifunctional devices while increasing survivability.  The new technologies will be compatible with other Soldier requirements, including Soldier performance, limited power generation, integrated sensors, communication and display technologies, weapons systems, and expected extremes of temperature, humidity, storage lifetimes, damage, and spoilage. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n    \nWork in this Project is performed by the ARL in Adelphi, MD."

The focus will be on establishing a first of its kind, multi-site distributed quantum network based on quantum memories.  The Center for Distributed Quantum Information will study and demonstrate both the physical backbone and network layer for a robust quantum information network that will provide secure and tamper-proof communications and exponentially greater information processing capabilities for the future Army.  The Center for Distributed Quantum Information will perform collaborative research with Army in-house scientists and engineers to help accelerate the transition of the research.  In addition to providing the required expertise and critical mass to the effort, the  consortium will also bring together a broad but unified multi-disciplinary research team needed to accelerate progress in the field of quantum information sciences. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas, and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD."

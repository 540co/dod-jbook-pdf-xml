            "val": "The Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information System (G-TSCMIS) Program was initially an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nation\u2019s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events.  February 11, 2019, OSD assigned the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) as the lead for G-TSCMIS and any successor comprehensive security management information system. G-TSCMIS was adopted from a theater specific system, originally developed in 1999, and has been updated at least three times.  Nevertheless, it still lacks basic functionality that the SC enterprise, consisting of Geographical Combatant Commands (GCCs), Military Departments, and Defense Agencies, have called for since 2010, including but not limited to SC activity life-cycle management, alignment of activities to strategic guidance, institutionalizing a common operational picture, adaptability and scalability to encompass all SC organizations, and interfacing with other SC-relevant authoritative data sources.  Additionally, the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act enacted a number of reforms to the Department of Defense\u2019s security cooperation (SC) enterprise, consolidating various security cooperation authorities under a single chapter in Title 10 to provide greater clarity to the scope of these programs and to improve management and oversight of these programs.  Through these reforms the Department now manages more than 100,000 SC activities per year at a cost of more than $10 billion, consisting of 40 distinct programs and support to dozens of different organizations and relies on an antiquated system, the G-TSCMIS to manage them. To meet the FY2017 NDAA requirements, DSCA is developing a successor system to replace G-TSCMIS after migrating the data. \n\nDSCA requires an innovative prototype capable of meeting the needs of the SC enterprise and developing an enterprise-wide technology to facilitate and integrate planning, budgeting, collaboration, program design, assessment, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting in support of all U.S. security cooperation activities and.

DSCA concluded that there is not a single Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solution that meets all of the SC enterprise needs.  The two main challenges are: stitching together multiple software solutions into one application, and sophisticated customization.  DSCA developed an innovative acquisition strategy for the successor system in consultation with the Defense Innovation Board and other IT acquisition experts and determined that utilizing an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) through a Consortium is the best option.  The strategy will increase competition, maximizing savings, and leverage flexible development approaches.  DSCA is utilizing a phased approach to develop the successor system.  The first phase, which is scheduled to be completed by September 2019, will complete G-TSCMIS Release 3 as the final capability enhancements to G-TSCMIS.  Phase II will gather industry driven solutions to develop a system that provides a modernized, versatile platform.  Towards this goal, DSCA, through Washington Headquarter Services, will then issue a competitive prototyping award.  DSCA will issue a production release that deploys the solution to the entire SC enterprise in FY 2021.  The third phase will continue to add new capabilities and functional enhancements to the successor system that can include new SC programs and processes, an expanded data model, refined AM&E capabilities, and two-way interfacing with other systems."

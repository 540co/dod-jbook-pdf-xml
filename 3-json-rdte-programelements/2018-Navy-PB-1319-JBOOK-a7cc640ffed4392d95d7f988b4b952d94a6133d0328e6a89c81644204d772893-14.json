            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program and its associated Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments.  These investments represent game-changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts.  They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.    INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities. The projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging technology development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future.  The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be established to further develop the demonstrated capability.   These investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy, with new INPs approved by the 4-star RDT&E Corporate Board.  \n\nDeveloping INPs and Leap Ahead Technologies requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, as well as other pre-Milestone B efforts such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts.  \n\nThis is a new PE for FY 2018 that consolidates all Navy 6.2 Applied Research investments funding INPs and their associated LA-Tech investments into a single Navy 6.2 PE.  In FY 2017, these investments were spread across 4 separate 6.2 PEs:  0602114N Power Projection Applied Research , 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research, 0602271N Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research, and 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments within this portfolio to be viewed in one place.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 INP and LA-Tech investments in a single place."

The EMRG capability will support Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Fast Attack Craft and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC\/FIAC) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions. Conduct applied research addressing the unique technical challenges inherent in the construction, assembly and operation of an Electro Magnetic (EM) railgun prototype capable of launching long range projectiles repeatedly, many times per minute.  Special materials and compact sub-system components will be developed that are capable of operating in harsh thermal and electromagnetic environments. Advanced modeling tools will be developed to assess design options, analyze system concepts and inform experimental hardware design and testing.  \n\nDevelop and test next generation battery energy storage and pulsed power components to assess performance and applicability towards future designs.  Develop and refine algorithms for controlling the precision timed electromagnetic pulse used to fire the railgun in the rep-rate mode.  Conduct material, physics and thermal property research for long-life, rep-rate electromagnetic launch systems and actively monitor performance to understand the high currents, elevated operating temperatures, and cooling of components, so as to improve designs and increase their reliability.  Develop modeling and simulation tools that support electromagnetic launch, multi-shot life development, testing, and assessments.\n\nLA-Tech:  Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM)\n\nComplete the SSL TM project, which was previously funded in PE 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research. Finish development of technologies suitable for a solid state laser weapon system, including technologies for a maritime beam director, targeting, tracking and laser subsystems, which are capable of supporting future Navy surface ship defensive missions to defeat small boat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms, and which provide Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) disruption and\/or defeat. This effort includes conducting scientific studies that address the modeling and simulation critical to understanding the missions involved in a layered defensive capability in the maritime environment.  Conclude testing against threat representative targets, components and subsystems to determine weapon capabilities and lethality. These tests provide data that support improved modeling and simulation and the development of governing technical requirements for an integrated High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon system capable of conducting Navy surface ship self-defense missions.  Finish studies of atmospheric scattering, absorption and turbulence effects in low altitude, maritime, surface conditions, which provide critical data for understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapon systems effectiveness.  Complete scientific studies and testing on laser subcomponents, including tests on laser pump diodes and laser gain media. These laser subcomponent technologies have potential in future weapon acquisition programs that are based on solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research that is suitable for use in the maritime domain.  Conclude scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons and provide an inherent 'safe-arm' function for the projection of laser power at long range (potentially beyond visible, line-of-sight distances). The capability to halt laser energy propagation in real time while performing Navy surface ship self-defense missions is necessary to avoid inadvertent illumination of non-threat forces (e.g., friendly sensors or platforms).  Conduct testing of the laser weapon system demonstrator, including a Tactical Laser Core Module (TLCM).\n\nLA-Tech:  High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS)\n\nContinue HIJENKS, a joint USAF\/USN project previously funded as a FY17 Leap-Ahead jump-start effort in PE 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research.  Develop a High Power Radio Frequency (HPRF) technology payload integrated on an air platform capable of engaging multiple electronic targets with a single, scalable effects weapon across a variety of warfighting missions.  This effort will culminate in a live-fire demonstration of a multi-mission\/multi-target HPRF payload integrated into a demonstration platform.  The operational impacts include decreased cost exchange ratios, non-kinetic counter electronic effects, reduced collateral damage, and the ability to engage multiple targets with a single weapon.  This effort aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.  During FY18, the following applied research development efforts are planned: investigate Radio Frequency (RF) effects on complex electronic systems with the goal being to finalize an RF waveform specification; investigate HPRF weapons effects for non-kinetic counter electronics to include the prediction model improvements required for mission planning of Directed Energy Weapons (DEW); perform Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to capture RF antenna output, RF propagation, RF interaction with complex enclosures, and RF interaction with electronic circuits to characterize DEW performance to the maximum extent possible; conduct research into the time-out of action or recuperation time for complex electronics, exploring Battle Damage Indicators (BDI) for electronic disruption; determine the critical pulsed power and RF components required to reduce the HPRF payload's Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP); perform a trade-off analysis of the technology alternatives, their maturity, and their suitability for this application; develop the most promising component technologies, such as conformal antenna designs for high power, advanced high power RF source technologies, pulsed power components with higher energy densities, and advanced architectures and magnetic materials for high voltage power electronics systems; conduct risk reduction research for the RF source and antenna subsystems by examining high risk, high payoff technology alternatives to improve output power while simultaneously reducing system size and weight, and examine the efficiency of each subsystem and the impact of overall payload prime power requirements."

The AACUS project will complete research efforts to develop and mature technologies that perform autonomous take-off, conduct en-route navigation, classify the terrain of landing zones, detect and avoid ground-based obstacles, and safely operate in degraded visual environments.  In addition to maturing these individual technologies, specific attention will be directed toward the task of integrating them into a full scale autonomous platform to increase their technology readiness level.\n\nINP:  Claws\n\nInitiate Claws.  Claws will develop the autonomy required to operate large and extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in an anti-access, anti-denial environment.  To support large and extra-large UUV operations further forward and farther from the battle group, the technology will be evolved to allow operations with limited navigational fixes and limited communication opportunities.  During FY18, research will be conducted and technology will be matured in the areas of precision navigation, obstacle avoidance, robust communications, on-board vulnerability assessment, and payload autonomy.  Applied research efforts in advanced undersea autonomy will also be initiated.\n\nINP:  Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV)\n\nComplete the LDUUV project, which was previously funded in 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research.  The LDUUV INP is developing the critical technologies of energy, autonomy, endurance, and submarine launch and recovery.   These critical technologies are needed to enable Large UUVs to be pier and ship launched, and recovered. The technologies will enable the completion of missions with long ranges, as well as those requiring over 60 days of endurance for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) tasks.  Continue development of the long endurance, air-independent energy source technology for large UUVs.  Continue development of the autonomy technology that will support operation of the UUV in the littorals.  Continue development of core UUV technologies that will extend the reliability and endurance of the UUV operating in the littorals.  Conduct a UUV fuel cell systems technology analysis, which will be used to support a land-based demonstration.  \n\nINP:  Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST)\n\nContinue the LOCUST project, previously funded in PEs 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research and 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research.  LOCUST will ultimately deliver a scalable system of inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and payloads that will provide game-changing disruptive capabilities over a wide range of military operations and areas of operations.  LOCUST will make advances in unmanned system collective autonomous behaviors, robust low probability of interception or detection ad hoc networks, and payload miniaturization and modularity breakthroughs to counter threats in constrained urban environments, as well as large-scale anti-access area denial defenses.  This will be accomplished at greatly reduced cost and risk when compared to traditional manned platform target prosecution.  The applied research effort in 2018 specifically will conduct preliminary system design and technology developments within the three major LOCUST sub-systems: (1) the Distributed, Collaborative, Coordinated, & Cognitive autonomy system architecture; (2) the distributed Command & Control system architecture; and (3) a series of modular UAV payloads.  \n\nLA-Tech:  Large Displacement UUV - Advanced Power and Energy Demonstration (LDUUV-APED)\n\nContinue LDUUV-APED, which was previously funded in PE 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research.  The LDUUV-APED Program is integrating the Aluminum Power System (ALPS) air-independent fuel cell system into an existing LDUUV vehicle and conducting at-sea testing to demonstrate a mission endurance capability that meets the Navy's UUV far-term objectives (up to 70 days) for a persistent forward presence.  During FY18, the hull structural design and analysis will be completed and the energy section hull will be fabricated.  Integration of ALPS into the energy section hull will begin.  Modifications to the vehicle to accept the ALPS energy section will begin.  The notional mission profiles will be finalized and development of the test plan will begin.  The vehicle-level hazards analysis will be completed and the range approval process will continue to be supported. \n\nLA-Tech:  Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV) \n\nContinue MDUSV, which was previously funded in 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research.  The MDUSV project will continue research efforts to develop and mature technologies in multiple areas that will be used to assess the feasibility of an MDUSV to perform Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Electronic Warfare (EW) mission area requirements.  Autonomy technologies being matured include a robust perception approach using Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors and technologies that enable autonomous all-weather operations, detection of low radar cross section craft, reduced vulnerability to jamming, and operations with reduced Radio Frequency (RF) emissions.  MCM technologies being developed include mine sweeping capabilities using High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) magnets in combination with acoustic sweep technologies.  ASW technologies being developed include an advanced version of the Non-Traditional Sensor System (NTSS) to be assessed for its autonomous ASW track and trail capability.  The project also includes development of an NTSS EW payload integrated with an MS3 Sonar.  These emerging technologies are being designed and developed for an MSUSV prototype that will be capable of performing multiple autonomous missions over extended periods of time.  \n\nLA-Tech:  Tern\n\nComplete Tern, a joint ONR and DARPA project, previously funded in 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research. Continue airplane launch and recovery component and subsystem technology developments to enable medium size, long-endurance, long-range Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to be launched and recovered on short deck ships.  Continue the maturation of technology addressing integration challenges associated with developing a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV capability.\n\nLA-Tech:  USV Swarm\nContinue USV Swarm, which was previously funded in PE 0602271N Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research .

Key elements of DOT&E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2019 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List. \n\nCyber Evaluations\nDOT&E plans to sponsor approximately 25 Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service cybersecurity assessments and Cyber Readiness Campaigns (CRCs) events in FY 2019, each including \u201cFind-Fix-Verify\u201d efforts to facilitate the remediation of identified vulnerabilities and verify that solutions and mitigations improve warfighter mission assurance. DOT&E plans to continue working with the CCMDs and Services to develop multiyear plans for exercise cyber assessments and CRC events. These plans will focus on assessing the CCMD\u2019s or Service\u2019s ability to complete missions in a contested cyber environment. To support threat-representative assessments, and to facilitate improvement of DoD\u2019s cybersecurity posture, DOT&E will continue efforts with U.S. Cyber Command to implement the Global Persistent Cyber Opposing Force (PCO) capability with authorities to perform year-round and long-duration assessments of all CCMDs and Services. Primary objectives for DOT&E\u2019s assessments in FY 2019 include the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats and the assessment of operational missions during realistic cyber attacks and any corresponding response actions to adversary attacks. \n\nDOT&E will assess Cyber Protection Teams and Cyber Mission Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC, or exercise events. DOT&E will continue to develop techniques to efficiently and effectively assess offensive cyber capabilities, conduct timely evaluations of these capabilities, and consider the development of a potential cyber variant of the Joint Munition Effectiveness Manual.  DOT&E will fund joint assessments of Mode 5 Identification of Friend or Foe capabilities.  DOT&E will transmit critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD\u2019s cybersecurity posture. FY 2019 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs."

DOT&E plans to continue working with the CCMDs and Services to develop multiyear plans for exercise cyber assessments and CRC events. To support threat representative assessments, and to facilitate improvement of DoD\u2019s cybersecurity posture, DOT&E will continue efforts with U.S. Cyber Command to implement the Global Persistent Cyber Opposing Force (PCO) capability with authorities to perform year round and long-duration assessments of all CCMDs and Services. Primary objectives for DOT&E\u2019s assessments in FY 2020 include the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats and the assessment of operational missions during realistic cyber attacks and any corresponding response actions to adversary attacks.  DOT&E will assess Cyber Protection Teams and Cyber Mission Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC, or exercise events. DOT&E will continue to develop techniques to efficiently and effectively assess offensive cyber capabilities, conduct timely evaluations of these capabilities, and consider the development of a potential cyber variant of the Joint Munition Effectiveness Manual. DOT&E will transmit critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD\u2019s cybersecurity posture. FY 2020 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs."

Automating insider threat reporting, and aggregating data from throughout the DoD and federal government will potentially save lives and money through thwarting insider threats and leaks. Automation of integrated tools will offset increasing manpower needs. The system will also be available to the components for use, reducing the costs overall for new Insider Threat system development and sustainment throughout the DoD. \n\n\nFY 2017 Accomplishments:\nContinued development of existing capabilities to better serve the insider threat community, while beginning the system re-architecture design to make the technical capabilities more flexible and adaptable, increasing communication\/information sharing, decreasing cyber vulnerabilities, and cost savings each year in software licensing and technical support. Initial pilot deployment to 11 DoD Components for use as internal case management system."

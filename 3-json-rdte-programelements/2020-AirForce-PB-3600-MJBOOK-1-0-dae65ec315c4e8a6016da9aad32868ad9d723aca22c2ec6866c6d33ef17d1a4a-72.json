            "val": "Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) supports Air Force Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) and Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) integration. DMO is an operational readiness initiative enabling the USAF to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war while facilitating unit-level training. FCMT funding provides research in areas benefiting the AF DMO\/LVC environment as a whole. Provides research and development to facilitate integration of fielded and newly acquired, Air Force owned training devices into DMO\/LVC networks. Enhances the quality of training for the systems added to the network. Enables aircrews to network with LVC components to form the integrated DMO battlespace. Links geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance systems. Develops, demonstrates and inserts multi-level security capability. This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Full Combat Mission Training capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nIn FY 2019, PE 0207701F, Full Combat Mission Training, Project 655354, F-16 Block (Blk) 40\/50 Mission Training Center (MTC) efforts were transferred to PE 0207133F, F-16, Project 672671, F-16 Blk 40\/50 MTC, in order to transfer programmatic responsibilities and funding to the F-16 weapon system team.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

FCMT funding provides research in areas benefiting the AF DMO\/LVC environment as a whole.  Provides research and development to facilitate integration of fielded and newly acquired, Air Force owned training devices into DMO\/LVC networks.  Enhances the quality of training for the systems added to the network.  Enables aircrews to network with LVC components to form the integrated DMO battlespace.  Links geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance systems.  Develops, demonstrates and inserts multi-level security capability.  This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training."

The initial systems in the DMO\/LVC environment; F-15C\/E, Airborne Warning and Control System, and F-16 Block 40\/50, all required new training systems.  Additionally, the Operations and Integration capability was created.  The Training Simulation Service (TSS) acquisition strategy was used to meet a portion of these requirements.  In the TSS approach, the contractor owns and provides the simulator equipment, maintains simulator concurrency with weapon systems, and has incentives to keep the equipment up to date with simulator and network technologies.  Currently fielded and projected Air Force-owned Flight and Mission Training Systems without DMO\/LVC capability will be modified using FCMT funds to ensure compatibility with the DMO\/LVC environment.  To accomplish this, the Air Force Research Laboratory will conduct research\/studies to Develop\/implement CDS, develop DMO capabilities, validate warfighter seasoning, develop objective performance enhancements, and conduct other network studies."

Each is capable of linking to geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance systems. This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training.

SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $6.4B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  In FY12, as an AF pilot initiative, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&M to RDT&E, AF funds. \n\nSMC is authorized to employ approximately 1,501 civilian acquisition professionals providing the management, tools, and technical capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB 61 Air Base Group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Air Force initiatives in response to the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act.  This program element supports both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop\nnew or repurpose capabilities.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

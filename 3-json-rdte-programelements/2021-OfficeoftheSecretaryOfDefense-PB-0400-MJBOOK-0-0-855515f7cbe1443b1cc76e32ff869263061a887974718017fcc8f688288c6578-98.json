Characteristics of this budget activity include software, and electronic tools, systems, applications, resources, acquisition of services, business process re-engineering activities, functional requirements development, technical evaluations, and other activities in direct support of acquiring, developing, deploying, sustaining, enhancing, and modernizing Software and Digital Technology Pilot Programs. AWCFT funds Project Maven, a rapid fielding Artificial Intelligence (AI) program to augment and automate Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) for Full Motion Video (FMV) Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude, High Altitude, and Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms in support of defeat-ISIS and National Defense Strategy (NDS) peer\/near peer competitor strategy. Project Maven also brings AI to Captured Enemy Material (CEM), Acoustical Intelligence (ACINT), Overhead Persistent Infrared program (OPIR) and Public Available Information (PAI) exploitation. Project Maven uses AI, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT). Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Project Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform)."

This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision into the process of object detection, identification, and tracking at computer process speed versus human speed. Incorporating computer vision and algorithms will reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data. Project Maven plans to develop algorithms focused on tactical UAV FMV Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and an operational PED environment for platforms and ground stations. AW will build capabilities, integrate AI and ML to provide actionable intelligence and enhancement to military decision-making by providing algorithms for object detection, classification and user alerts."

            "val": "The Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program Element encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions for small, medium and large caliber munitions, tank ammunition, mortar ammunition, cannon artillery ammunition, and close combat system items.  These Projects will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of United States maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats. To achieve this, Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition projects will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.\n\nProject 694 Medium Caliber Ammunition: This Project supports development of 30x113 millimeter (mm) self-destructing airburst munitions and qualify 30x113mm linked ammunition for ground vehicles. Increase precision and lethality capability to defeat personnel and materiel targets as well as support the Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement (JUONS) CC-0558 Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) to counter the rapidly evolving threat of Unmanned Aerial Systems. This effort will qualify the links for use with existing M788 and M789 ammunition and develop self-destructing and airburst capable munitions fired from the Lightweight 30x113mm Link Fed Chain Gun.  There is no Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 request.\n\nProject BQ4 155mm Artillery Propulsion: Supercharge is a stand-alone top-zone 155 millimeter (mm) propelling charge required to achieve maximum range requirements from the XM1299A1 Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH). It will achieve lethality overmatch out to 70 kilometers (km) with developmental extended range projectiles, and will increase range with legacy projectiles by thirty percent. Supercharge is composed of combustible cartridge case (foamed celluloid or felted fiber technology), integral metal Stub Case, electrically initiated primer, and advanced artillery propellant. FY 2021 funding will support design risk reduction and prototype maturation efforts for two parallel Supercharge variants (2-piece bag and cased) to support the concurrent development of ERCA Increment 1C and ERCA Increment 2 (with added automated loading system), which directly supports the Army's Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross Functional Team (CFT) priority in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nProject EB8 OWL for Small Caliber: The OWL project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 caliber munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability, and increasing lethality by incorporating Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) technology into the new tracer ammunition. 7.62mm and 5.56mm are the immediate focus followed by a similar development strategy for .50 caliber cartridges. There is no FY 2021 funding request.\n\nProject EB9 Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM) supports the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the AAECM to include the XM215 Flare and XM20 Radio Frequency (RF) expendables. These expendable countermeasures systems are essential parts of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army Research Development Technology & Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts are coordinated with Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation to address the AAECM capability, a critical enabler for the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) - Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) CFT within the Army's top modernization priorities.\n\nThese advanced decoys will address deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. This program will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will demonstrate component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major Army aircraft platforms. FY 2021 includes initial developmental\/operational testing on XM215 and RF Countermeasures (CM).\n\nProject EC2 ADVAP:  The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) Initial Capability Document (ICD) which outlines the requirements for new ammunition to support the rapid prototyping\/development of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) under the Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) authority for rapid prototyping\/rapid fielding. New ADVAP ammunition is designed to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.\n\nThe Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition is split into two initial variants, the General Purpose (GP) and the Special Purpose (SP). The nomenclature for the GP ammunition is XM1186 and the nomenclature for the SP ammunition is XM1184. The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) ammunition to defeat hard targets.  There is no FY 2021 funding request.\n\nProject EC3 Ammunition Logistics Prototyping: This Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. FY 2021 funding will be used to reduce device cost and establish an alternate source for monitoring devices, as well as, verifying that issues found during testing have been resolved. FY 2021 funding will also be used to demonstrate a suite of monitoring technologies, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability.\n\nProject EL7 Reduced Range Ammunition: The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. There is no funding requested in FY 2021.\n\nProject EU3 .50 Caliber APTC: The APTC project is a critical technology development in response to the .50 caliber Munitions Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of APTC is to deliver a single round that replaces and improves current legacy .50 caliber ammunition. The APTC will be compatible with all Army .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M2 Machine Guns. There is no FY 2021 funding request.\n\nProject FA5 APWM:  The APWM is focused on advanced risk mitigation, technology integration, prototyping, and product support to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems within a complex system of systems environment. The APWM Project reinforces the National Defense Strategy's major lines of effort through technology development and prototyping, which increases lethality and ensures future combat overmatch success of the Joint Force against peer\/near-peer adversaries. This project also aims to improve program performance and affordability for multiple weapons and munitions Programs of Record (PoRs) via Joint Lethality Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) and Army M-Code Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinated efforts. The APWM Project directly supports top Army Modernization Priorities via the Assured-PNT (A-PNT) and LRPF CFT imperatives in support of the National Defense Strategy.  FY 2021 funding will support engagement by Weapons and Munitions PNT experts in the development, evaluation, and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's M-Code GPS, Army's PNT related programs, and A-PNT CFT programs in support of LRPF and Counter Area Access\/Area Denial missions. Funding will also enable component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a NavWar system-of-systems environment, Army M-Code GPS technology integration and evaluation, planning for next generation M-Code GPS integration into the Long Range-Precision Guidance Kit (LR-PGK) as the DoD-selected representative Joint precision munition, and maturation of alternative PNT related technologies and solutions to enable informed A-PNT related PoR milestone and Army cross-functional modernization decisions.\n\nProject FG1 C-DAEM: The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) Project will provide United States (U.S). ground forces with the capability to engage area personnel through armored targets, while denying threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was completed in January 2018 to inform Army acquisition and investment decisions regarding replacement of the current stockpile of 155 millimeter (mm) Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) with Department of Defense (DoD) policy compliant munitions and address anti-armor and extended range capability requirements.  The Army validated two materiel solutions for C-DAEM to be pursued in parallel.  C-DAEM Armor (Increment 1) will destroy moved and moving infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, and tanks. C-DAEM DPICM Replacement (Increment 2) will destroy personnel to light-skinned vehicles.  FY 2021 funding will support the completion of the C-DAEM Armor competitive demonstration phase, which will identify the most promising candidate(s) to support the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nProject XT5 30mm Anti-Personnel and Counter UAS: Lightweight 30x113mm (LW30) Airburst is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Production Document (CPD), AH-64E Helicopter, Increment 1, Version 6. The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the Warfighter to effectively engage antipersonnel\/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user with a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel and soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects. There is no funding requested in FY 2021."

Supercharge is composed of combustible cartridge case (foamed celluloid or felted fiber technology), integral metal Stub Case, electrically initiated primer, and advanced artillery propellant.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will support design risk reduction and prototype maturation efforts for two parallel Supercharge variants (2-piece bag and cased) to support the concurrent development of ERCA Increment 1C and ERCA Increment 2 (with added automated loading system), which directly supports the Army's Long Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team priority in support of the National Defense Strategy."

The Project will utilize the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) for the integration of components such as propellant, combustible case, igniter and stub case.  Upon design maturation, the Supercharge 2-piece Bag will transition and conduct Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) tasks to qualify the design for UMR to support the ERCA Increment 1C First Unit Issues (FUI).  The Supercharge Cased will require additional developmental testing and qualification for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to support ERCA Increment 2.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based production contract(s) will be awarded after the Supercharge Cased Milestone C for LRIP and Full Rate Production (FRP)."

The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability, and increasing lethality by incorporating Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) technology into the new tracer ammunition. 7.62mm and 5.56mm are the immediate focus followed by a similar development strategy for .50 caliber cartridges.

These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield.  Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization.  The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield.  This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will be used to reduce device cost and establish an alternate source for monitoring devices as well as verifying that issues found during testing have been resolved.  FY 2021 funding will also be used to demonstrate a suite of monitoring technologies, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability.  All research and development initiatives will be supporting the cross functional teams and the multi domain operations modernization objectives through deployment of prototypes for user evaluation."

The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. There is no funding requested in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021."

The APWM Project reinforces the National Defense Strategy's major lines of effort through technology development and prototyping, which increases lethality and ensures future combat overmatch success of the Joint Force against peer\/near-peer adversaries. This project also aims to improve program performance and affordability for multiple weapons and munitions Programs of Record (PoRs) via Joint Lethality Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) and Army M-Code Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinated efforts. The APWM Project directly supports top Army Modernization Priorities via the Assured-PNT (A-PNT) and Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross Functional Team (CFT) imperatives in support of the National Defense Strategy.  Funding will support engagement by Weapons and Munitions PNT experts in the development, evaluation, and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's M-Code GPS, Army's PNT related programs, and A-PNT CFT programs in support of LRPF and Counter Area Access\/Area Denial missions. Funding will also enable component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a NavWar system-of-systems environment, Army M-Code GPS technology integration and evaluation, planning for next generation M-Code GPS integration into the Long Range Precision Guidance Kit (LR-PGK) as the Department of Defense-selected representative Joint precision munition, and maturation of alternative PNT related technologies and solutions to enable informed A-PNT related PoR milestone and Army cross-functional modernization decisions."

The Joint Program Executive Office for Armaments and Ammunition (JPEO AA) was also able to successfully solicit continued review and feedback on the JPEO AA authored MGUE Inc2 PGM Technical Requirements document which was released by the Air Force for an approximate $750 Million dollar investment. Enabled A-PNT subject matter experts to participate and provide insightful feedback for multiple lethality program design reviews. Lastly, collaboration within this technical and overarching IPT led to collaborative technical maturation initiatives for enabling Assured PNT technology for precision weapons and munitions further increasing efficiency.

The Army validated two materiel solutions for C-DAEM to be pursued in parallel.  C-DAEM Armor (Increment 1) will destroy moved and moving infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, and tanks. C-DAEM DPICM Replacement (Increment 2) will destroy personnel to light-skinned vehicles.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will support the completion of the C-DAEM Armor competitive demonstration phase, which will identify the most promising candidate(s) to support the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy."

The U.S. Government is currently reducing risk by executing prototype testing and evaluation efforts in parallel to decompose the AoA results into selection criteria.  C-DAEM will use the selection criteria to sponsor a competitive demonstration for C-DAEM Armor to streamline the acquisition process by leveraging Section 815 of the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  C-DAEM will use the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to further support the completion of the C-DAEM Armor competitive demonstration phase, in FY 2021, which will inform the Army's cluster munition replacement strategy.  Upon completion of the competitive demonstration phase, C-DAEM will proceed to qualification testing of the most promising candidate(s) in accordance with the decisions granted at the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC), in April 2018."

The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the warfighter to effectively engage anti-personnel\/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user with a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel and soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects.  There is no funding requested in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021."

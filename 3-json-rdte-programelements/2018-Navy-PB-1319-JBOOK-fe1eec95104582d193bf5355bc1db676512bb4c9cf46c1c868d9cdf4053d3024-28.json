The program's main focus is on improving Marine force protection capabilities. To support the required capabilities, the Survivability Upgrade program will seek to incorporate Non-Developmental Items (NDI) and\/or Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) solutions into the existing P-Variant and C-Variant Reliability, Availability, Maintainability\/Rebuild to Standard (RAM\/RS) configuration of AAV. The acquisition strategy seeks to minimize cost and schedule, and maximize value, technology readiness, and commonality, while ensuring the selected manufacturer meets the capability attributes established for the RAM\/RS.

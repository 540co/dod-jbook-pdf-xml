            "val": "The Network-Centric Warfare Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.\n\nThe objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  \n\nThe Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services."

To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications), while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  RSPACE will also develop tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-ISR techniques.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic re-planning capability and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy."

The program will deliver an initial instantiation of a scalable experimentation engine capable of aircraft control at levels ranging from an advanced tactical autopilot to a form of multi-domain mosaic controller.  Experiments will explore both augmentation of existing manned platforms and increased capabilities and intelligence of future unmanned systems.  ACE will provide an early opportunity to experiment with adaptive human-machine teaming to deliver tools and architectures as the Joint Multi-Domain Battle concept evolves within the Services.

The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program was to develop and demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to direct high-power spatially resolved radio frequency (RF) beams to a single location.  ReACT provides this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single aperture.  The key technical challenge was to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  The ReACT system sensed the target's emissions and then optimally configured the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area of interest.  Technologies from this program transitioned to the Air Force and Navy."

Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them, and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

The CDMaST program will establish an analytical and experimental environment to explore architecture combinations in terms of operational effectiveness as well as engineering feasibility and robustness.  The program will leverage enabling technologies needed for command, control, and communication (C3) between physical domains in order to support the architecture constructs.  Through experimentation, the program will not only demonstrate integrated system performance, but also develop new tactics that capitalize on features created by the heterogeneous architecture.

Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around an ocean basin at known locations.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain and maintain location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus calculate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy."

Ocean of Things builds upon advances made in the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program, budgeted in this PE\/Project. Ocean of Things will develop large numbers of heterogeneous sensing  floats to cover large ocean areas, while incorporating environmentally friendly construction materials. These platforms will leverage satellite communications to populate a large data repository with sensor outputs for shared processing. Ocean of Things will apply advanced analysis techniques to the stored data to synthesize and discover new signals and behaviors in the ocean environment. The program will research the spatio-temporal composability of sensors and develop applications for distributed platform behavior using an internet of things (IoT) architecture deployed across the world's oceans. Further research will examine additional platform capabilities and system impacts of  communication rate and edge processing. The Ocean of Things program will improve ocean awareness and provide persistent coverage to areas between existing platforms. Technologies developed in Ocean of Things will transition to the Navy."

This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operate standards; and rapid, cost-effective deployment technologies.  The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to restore connectivity temporarily for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small-diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will emphasize early risk reduction with scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies will transition to the Services."

Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.  The Blue Wolf program provided a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges addressed included, dynamic lift and drag reduction, hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification, and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment.  The program leveraged Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies. Under an existing Memorandum of Agreement, following vehicle integration and initial testing, the program is transitioning to the Navy."

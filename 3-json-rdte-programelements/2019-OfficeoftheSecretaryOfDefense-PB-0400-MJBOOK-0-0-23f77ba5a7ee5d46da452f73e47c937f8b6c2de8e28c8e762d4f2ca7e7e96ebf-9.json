This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the Program Executive Office (PEO) IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.\n\nThe Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs."

These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; reduced smoke or smoky propellants, including formulation, characterization and scale-up; rocket motor case design; materials for active and passive thermal mitigation; shock mitigation materials and techniques; passive and active coatings; active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers; ignition systems; sensors; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsions systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of High Performance Propulsion rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large High Performance Propulsion motors."

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition Insensitive Munitions (IM) response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact and Slow and Fast Cook threats."

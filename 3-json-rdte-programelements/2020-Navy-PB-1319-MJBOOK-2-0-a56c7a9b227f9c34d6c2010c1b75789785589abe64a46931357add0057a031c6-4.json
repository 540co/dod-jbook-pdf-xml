Such air combat electronics developments include communications and airborne networking, navigation and sensors, flight avionics, safety systems, and flight mission information systems for both forward fit and retrofit aircraft. These efforts continue to maintain federated systems while encouraging transition of procurements to support a modular system for enhanced performance and affordability.  Consideration is given up front to reduce acquisition costs through larger procurement quantities that satisfy multi-aircraft customer requirements and that reduce life cycle costs in the areas of reliability, maintainability, and training.  This project also provides a Navy-wide program to develop required calibration standards (hardware) in all major measurement technology areas in support of Navy Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) systems as well as Navy Weapons systems, ground and air, throughout the Fleet.  It funds Navy lead-service responsibilities in the Department of Defense and Joint Services Metrology Research and Development program.  This project supports the military requirement to verify the performance of all test systems used to validate the operation of HM&E as well as Navy Weapon Systems with calibration standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION because it includes those projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production decision."

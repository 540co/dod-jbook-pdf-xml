            "val": "The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) environment (EME) is the largest and most complex warfighting environment because it is universally pervasive, largely unseen and can only be perceived through the use of advanced electronics technologies.  Understanding and managing EME warfighting challenges is essential to all military operations because it is through the use of EMS technologies that we perceive operational realities \u2013 the state and disposition of all military and nonmilitary groups\/forces \u2212 and coordinate all actions of our military forces.  \n\nHistorically, the United States has had technological advantages in EME warfighting technologies (i.e., sensors, communications and countermeasures), however, this is no longer the case in many technology areas due to the broad proliferation of advanced technologies, the rapid commercialization of advanced electronic systems and components and the concurrent rise of cyber-related technologies.  Leveraging these advanced technologies, adversaries are developing and fielding competing and asymmetric capabilities to offset past U.S. advantages.  Their efforts are making U.S. operations in the EMS and cyberspace significantly more difficult, and they are doing these things at accelerating rates.  Their developments include new generations of challenging threats ranging from small unmanned air systems and easily transportable Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to dedicated military systems incorporating the most advanced sensing, communication and electronic warfare (EW) technologies such as integrated air defense systems and increasingly capable cruise and ballistic missiles. \n\nThe accelerating rate at which new EMS and cyber threats are appearing demands much faster responses than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) research, development and acquisition (RD&A) processes can provide.  Concurrently, the effective operational lifetime of many advanced technology solutions is decreasing due to the accelerating pace of technological innovation.  For these reasons, we must begin developing technological solutions much quicker and at much lower costs.\n\nThe Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) Program was established to address these challenges through efforts designed to substantially accelerate the development and transition of innovative technology solutions to EMS warfighting challenges.  To do this, the JEAT program rapidly identifies, explores, develops, matures and demonstrates technologies and approaches that fall outside the Services\u2019 purviews.  By using both off-the-shelf and new military and commercial technologies in innovative ways, JEAT\u2019s approach has enabled needed capabilities to be delivered to the warfighter much sooner than possible by traditional DoD approaches and have also resulted in substantial savings for the Department in both research and development (R&D) and in Programs of Record.\n\nBeginning in FY 2020, all JEAT work has been moved into Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation.  Project 619, EW and Non-Kinetic Effects Experimentation and Oversight, was terminated and the efforts previously conducted within in Project 619 were moved into Project 245. \n\nPROJECT 619, EW AND NON-KINETIC EFFECTS EXPERIMENTATION AND OVERSIGHT\n\nProject 619 previously included three efforts: Experimentation\/Demonstration, Advanced Technology Development\/Verification and EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning.  All Project 619 efforts were moved into Project 245 in FY 2020.\n\nPROJECT 245, EW ENTERPRISE EXPLORATION AND INNOVATION (EW E&I)\n\nEW E&I identifies, explores, develops and rapidly matures and demonstrates EMS and hybrid electronic warfare (EW)-Cyber warfighting technology solutions at rates that are significantly faster than traditional Department developmental efforts and at much lower costs.  To do this, a thorough understanding of all the EMS and EW-Cyber challenges confronting warfighters and technology developers is foundational.  Knowledge of all of the efforts to mitigate these challenges is also essential.  Utilizing this knowledge, innovative potential technology solutions that fall outside the Services\u2019 purviews are identified and developed in state-of-the-art laboratory environments.  Promising potential solutions are then validated by fully exploring them side-by-side with existing capabilities and other potential technology solutions in real-world experimentation environments under real-world conditions.  To provide the greatest possible insights, these experimentation environments are designed so that they are operationally realistic \u2212 utilizing the most realistic threats available \u2212 and environmentally realistic \u2013 utilizing near-real-world EMS environments.  The knowledge gained through EW E&I efforts accelerates the transition of capabilities to the warfighter and informs senior leaders so they can more effectively oversee and direct all Department EW and EW-Cyber developmental efforts."

The JEAT team is DoD\u2019s acknowledged expert in designing and conducting large-scale open air field experimentation venues.  JEAT\u2019s experimentation venues are selected and scoped to explore technology solutions to some of the most difficult operational challenges facing U.S. warfighters.  JEAT\u2019s experimentation venues are designed to simultaneously examine numerous developmental and existing technologies side-by-side under the same conditions and they utilize realistic threats and real-world EMS environments to provide the greatest insights to operators, developers and decision-makers.  Leveraging JEAT\u2019s history of conducting highly successful experimentation venues, SILENT HAMMER (SH) is our current multi-year, multi-agency series of field experimentation venues and the first SH venue, SH 1, was conducted in late FY 2019.  Beginning in FY 2020, funding to conduct JEAT\u2019s experimentation venues will be provided by PE 0603699D8Z, Emerging Capabilities Technology Development.\n\u2022 Exploring, maturing and assessing technologies and approaches for multi-platform, multi-aperture, multi-domain (M3) engagement of passive\/active sensing architectures in very complex and highly congested EMS environments.    \n\u2022 Selecting, scoping, designing and conducting subsequent experimentation venues.

            "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1206601F, Space Technology efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1206601SF, Space Technology, from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity (BA) 02 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.  \n\nThis program focuses on four major areas. First, the space survivability and surveillance area develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Space Force systems. Second, the spacecraft payload technologies area improves satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities. Third, the spacecraft protection area develops technologies for protecting United States space assets in potential hostile settings. The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and  control technologies, and their interactions. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602298F, 0602601F, 0602602F, 0602605F, and 0602788F.\n\nThis work will still be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles (AFRL\/RV) Technology Directorate located at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. This is an administrative realignment and not a New Start.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2019 Air Force penalty total is $50.0M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

The focus is on characterizing and forecasting the battlespace environment for more realistic space system design, modeling, and simulation, as well as the battlespace environment's effect on space systems' performance. This includes technologies to specify and forecast the space environment for planning operations, ensure uninterrupted system performance, optimize space-based surveillance operations, and provide capability to mitigate or exploit the space environment for both offensive and defensive operations. Finally, this project includes the seismic research program that supports national requirements for monitoring nuclear explosions."

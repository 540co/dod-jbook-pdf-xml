The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same analysis and decision support tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term. Leveraging emerging technology to enhance existing capabilities and developing a mobile solution satisfies current and future needs of the enterprise. LIMS-EV funding supports BI and DS development capability used by senior leaders and war fighters to access integrated information from multiple authoritative logistics and operational source systems. LIMS-EV funding will extend current BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive\/what-if analysis, mobile applications and further integration of functionality per high priority requirements as defined\/approved by the Enterprise Logistics Information Technology (ELIT) authority including support equipment, vehicle, supply, commodities and components (engines, landing gears, fuel, etc.), weapons systems availability and Total Asset Visibility (TAV), and financial, Civil Engineering and Security Forces analytics. Enhances  LIMS-EV functionality per migration from the retiring Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) infrastructure to a an approved Joint Information Environment\/Common Computing Environment.\n\nBA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

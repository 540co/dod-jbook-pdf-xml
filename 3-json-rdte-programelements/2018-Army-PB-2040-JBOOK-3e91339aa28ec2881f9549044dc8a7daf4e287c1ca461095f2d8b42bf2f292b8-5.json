            "val": "The Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions. These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats. To achieve this, Weapons and Munitions Engineering Development Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.\n\nProject 656:  The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank. It has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay and airburst. AMP is the material solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition. In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles. The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015. FY 2016 supported multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase 1 of 2 for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). \n\nProject 694:  Joint Light Tactical Family of Vehicles (FoV): Develop and qualify 30x113mm ammunition for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) which will serve as the Infantry Brigade Combat Team Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (RV).  This is an Army directed requirement to enhance the operational effectiveness of the JLTV-RV by increasing precision and lethality capability to defeat personnel and material targets using a 30x113mm weapon system.  Qualify the linked M788 and M789 ammunition and develop airburst capable munitions for use with the Light Weight 30mm Link Fed Chain Gun.\nThe HEAB cartridge will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. As part of the pre-EMD activities, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Testing with contractors will occur to evaluate potential designs. For EMD, two Full and Open competitive contracts will be awarded. After Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E) the government will down-select to a single contractor for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and two production year options.\n\nProject EB8:  The One Way Luminescence (OWL) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix allowing enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL program's objective is to develop and field a full day\/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability. 7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm OWL cartridges. FY 2018 funding supports finalizing 7.62mm concept development. FY 2018 funding also supports maturing the 5.56mm OWL technology, procuring bullet components, tracer material and testing evaluation in order to attain a Technology Level Readiness (TRL) of 6 in FY 2020; and support of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract development necessary for a FY 2021 Milestone B (MS B).\n\nProject EB9:  The Tunable Pyrotechnic Aircraft Countermeasure Flares program supports the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM). These advanced decoys are necessary to address emerging threats and capabilities deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging JUONS from theatre.\n\nProject EC2:  The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158 and the companion trace is XM1159. The overall objective of the ADVAP program is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) a 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge linked 4:1 with a trace cartridge, XM1159, followed by a 5.56mm cartridge variant that will provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun ranges. The 7.62mm XM1158 and XM1159 cartridge will be optimized for use in the M240 Machine Gun.\n\nProject EC3:  The Ammunition Logistics Prototyping program supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  FY2018 dollars will support the completion of system component integration and verification testing and operational demonstration for the environmental health monitoring system, the completion of prototype development and verification testing of a next generation temperature\/humidity sensor, and the maturation of the design and fabrication of prototype plastic polymer rectangular containers for developmental 5.56mm ammunition.\n\nProject EL7:  The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. FY 2018 dollars support Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction in preparation for a 7.62mm TRL 6 demonstration and preparation for Milestone B (MS-B). Leverage lessons learned from Marine Corp .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort. Purchase test articles and perform engineering tests to qualify the .50 Caliber Marine Corps design\/ammunition for Army use.\n\nProject EL8:  The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The goal of the LSCA Program is to reduce the Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight. The LSCA Program will develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges. The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun. FY 2018 funding will support the development of the preliminary lightweight cartridge design to include a Systems Requirement Review, Preliminary Design Review, and manufacturing of Pre-Validation Test Samples.\n\nProject EU1:  The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) project will evaluate, develop, mature, and demonstrate new lethality technologies for 155mm cannon artillery munitions and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD).  The ELCM project will prototype and accelerate the maturation of enhanced lethality technologies, such as Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT), for 155mm cannon artillery munition.  The ELCM project will accelerate the development and maturation of LFT for subsequent integration on the 155mm XM1128 high explosive projectile per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition, 22 December 2016.  ELCM addresses requirements for increased lethality above the current U.S. Army go-to-war 155mm high explosive unitary projectiles, the M795 Insensitive Munition.  FY 2018 funding will support prototyping of enhanced lethality technologies applicable to 155mm cannon artillery munitions.\n\nProject EU2:  The Improved Multi-Option Fuze (iMOFA\/iMOFM) project will identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate new improved multi-option fuze technologies, components, and subsystems based on Government-owned Next Generation Proximity Sensor (NGPS) capabilities with built-in exportability attributes previously matured via OSD-sponsored techbase efforts under the Joint Fuze Technology Program and Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Congressional Pilot Program. This project will support technology maturation and risk reduction, and will evaluate and analyze producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in representative realistic performance-related developmental tests.  Up to four potential NGPS with built-in DEF technology prototype solutions for improved multi-option fuzing systems from Government and\/or Industry will be prototyped and evaluated.  This project will enable fact-based analysis of new Government-owned height of burst\/proximity fuzing alternatives that are resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats, quantify their effectiveness, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing\/new artillery\/mortar fuzes and munitions.\n\nProject FA5: The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions project is a continuation of FY14-16 efforts initiated under 644120A-ED5.  The objective of this advanced component development and prototyping effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapons and munitions systems to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent Program of Record (PoR) integration risk. Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions are an integral part of US military strategy and continue to enable combat overmatch and dominance across the Land Component battlespace. Unhindered access to trusted Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information under conditions where existing space based PNT (i.e. P(Y)-Code Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied has created the need to develop, prototype, and evaluate new\/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both PGMs and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment.  This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense. As such, both precision weapon and munition PoRs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force\u2019s Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army\u2019s Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments across multiple Lethality portfolios.  FY 2018 funding will support requirements for MGUE Increment 2 and Pseudolite related technology maturity for Assured PNT Milestone decisions, analysis and evaluation of various assured precision prototype technologies in weapons and munitions systems to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent Program of Record (PoR) integration risk, including specific focus on Pseudolite related weapons and munitions integration risk mitigation and Emplaced Weapon Use-Case needed for Precision Fires, and development, prototyping, and evaluation of new\/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) for PGK, M777A2, and M119A3 when operating in a complex heterogeneous system-of-systems environment, and continue prototyping\/evaluation in support of a subsequent M-Code\/Pseudolite capable setter. \n\nProject FG1: The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) project will analyze, identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate 155mm Cannon Artillery munition area effects capability.  C-DAEM are envisioned as a suite of 155mm artillery munitions, to provide U.S. ground forces with a capability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize, and\/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  Initial objective values for C-DAEM would meet Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) effects capabilities against personnel and light vehicles and exceed DPICM effects capabilities against armor.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be completed to best inform necessary area effect lethality requirements.  The project addresses requirements from the U.S. Army adopted U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) [AROC adopted 20 October 2016, JROC approved 11 May 2016].  The approved C-DAEM ICD as an Army requirement is located in the Capabilities and Army Requirements Documents number 0438.  The Joint Staffing Designator is Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) Interest.  FY 2018 funding will support the completion of the C-DAEM AoA to inform C-DAEM required capabilities and the Milestone A review with MDA.\n\nProject XT5: Lightweight 30mm x 113mm (LW30) Airburst ammunition is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement. The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the warfighter\u2019s probability in defeating anti-personnel and anti-materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability allows a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel & soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability while troops are in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects. FY 2018 supports Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction effort."

It has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015.  FY 2016 supported multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase 1 of 2 for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD)."

The 40mm LV HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to effectively engage targets at increased ranges using the 40mm M203\/M320 Grenade Launchers. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased ranges with greater accuracy and lethality. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge.

The OWL program's objective is to develop and field a full day\/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm OWL cartridges.  FY 2018 funding supports finalizing 7.62mm concept development.  FY 2018 funding also supports maturing the 5.56mm OWL technology, procuring bullet components, tracer material and testing evaluation in order to attain a Technology Level Readiness (TRL) of 6 in FY 2020; and support of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract development necessary for a FY 2021 Milestone B (MS B)."

These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments.  Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms.  These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging JUONS from theatre.

The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions.  The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas.  RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ.  This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges.  The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns.  FY 2018 dollars support Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction in preparation for a 7.62mm TRL 6 demonstration and preparation for Milestone B (MS-B).  Leverage lessons learned from Marine Corp .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort.

The objective of this advanced component development and prototyping effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapons and munitions systems to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent Program of Record (PoR) integration risk. Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions are an integral part of US military strategy and continue to enable combat overmatch and dominance across the Land Component battlespace. Unhindered access to trusted Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information under conditions where existing space based PNT (i.e. P(Y)-Code Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied has created the need to develop, prototype, and evaluate new\/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both PGMs and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment.  This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense. As such, both precision weapon and munition PoRs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force\u2019s Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army\u2019s Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments across multiple Lethality portfolios."

Airburst capability allows a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation.  The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel & soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability while troops are in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects.

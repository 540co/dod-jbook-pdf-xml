It is also the primary Air Mobility Command Command and Control (AMC C2) planning and scheduling tool enabling AMC air mobility resources to support peacetime, contingency, humanitarian, and wartime operations. In the Air Refueling Management System (ARMS), CAMPS provides the ability to request, manage and validate requests for air refueling.  Force-level CAMPS users include the USTRANSCOM Fusion Center, 618th Air Operations Center (AOC) Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), and other AOC Air Mobility Divisions (AMDs). Several web-based applications also support movement and air refueling requests for globally distributed Joint, Service, and Wing\/Unit level users.\n\nThe 618th AOC (TACC) is a global air operations center responsible for planning and executing airlift and air refueling missions in support of the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE). Although primarily used by the 618th AOC (TACC), CAMPS also supports validation, planning, and scheduling activities found at AMD and USTRANSCOM. CAMPS airlift and air refueling requirement management applications are available for all globally distributed Joint, Service, and Wing\/Unit level users that need to request airlift or air refueling. \n\nThe current CAMPS AR capability does not have access to all data sources necessary to maintain visibility of and support for all potential re-planning requirements and therefore can have \u2018blind spots\u2019 which hinder its ability to provide robust support for planning and re-planning across the entire \u201cinitial through final\u201d planning phase. This CAMPS Increment I (modernization) effort will build on the existing technology transitioned from RDT&E initiatives.  \n\nFY18 begins funding the Air Refueling capability development and testing to provide planners an integrated human-in-the-loop and machine-based cooperative system which provides the ability to rapidly generate and evaluate multiple potential solution candidates to satisfy AR requirements.  This will increase the effectiveness and efficiency with which Air Refueling assets are employed and support increased operational agility through more, rapid, effective and efficient re-planning while minimizing the impact on currently planned mission sets.  The AR metrics component will enable on-going improvement of the AR system and be developed after extensive analysis and iterations with the constituent user sets and command authorities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production, and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

            "val": "Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. FVL was established in 2009 by the Secretary of Defense to focus all Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift capabilities and technology development, as well as retaining long-term engineering capabilities. In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years.  The development and fielding of FVL will significantly improve vertical lift capabilities providing critical aviation support to the Joint warfighting community.  Increases in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint can only be achieved through the FVL approach of developing a new aircraft design.  FVL will integrate advancements in technologies and design configurations balanced with appropriate trades to ensure affordability. \n\nPE 0603801A, Project B47, Future Vertical Lift funding provides for the development of a Capability Set 3 aircraft system within the FVL family of systems.  FVL Capability Set 3 aircraft will conduct Air Assault, Amphibious Assault, Urban Assault\/Security, Attack, Maritime Interdiction, Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Humanitarian Assistance\/Disaster Relief (HA\/DR), Tactical Resupply, Direct Action (DA), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations in support of Army, including Army Special Operations Command, Marine Corps and Joint forces.  The FVL Capability Set 3 platform will significantly increase speed, range, mobility, and payload over current US Army H-60 and US Marine Corps H-1 aircraft and provide Combatant Commanders with tactical capabilities at greatly increased operational and strategic distances.  The FVL Materiel Development Decision was approved in October 2016.  FY 2017 funding provides for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis and Acquisition Strategy development.  FY 2018 funding completes development and execution of the AoA, acquisition planning and strategy development, and begins development of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Request for Proposal (RFP) and associated plans and other documentation required to support Milestone A decision and RFP release in FY 2019."

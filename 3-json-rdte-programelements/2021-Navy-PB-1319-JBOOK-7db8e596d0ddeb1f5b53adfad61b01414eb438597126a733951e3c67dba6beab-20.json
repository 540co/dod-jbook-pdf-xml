This will be accomplished through protection, detection, response, restoration, remediation, and mitigation. Testing and evaluation will be completed at Marine Corps facilities and Government Labs, to include the Marine Corps Cyber Range, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA).\n\nSec. 1647 of the FY16 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense by not later than December 31, 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will build upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and shall not duplicate similar ongoing efforts such as Task Force Cyber Awakening or conduct redundant assessment on systems that have already been evaluated. \n\nSec. 1647 assessment will be formalized in Vulnerability Assessment Reports (VARs), Cyber Table Top Exercises (CTTXs), Cyber Risk Analysis (CRAs) and other reporting. \n\nSec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Assessments will end in 2020 with the submission of the final report. Strategies mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation."

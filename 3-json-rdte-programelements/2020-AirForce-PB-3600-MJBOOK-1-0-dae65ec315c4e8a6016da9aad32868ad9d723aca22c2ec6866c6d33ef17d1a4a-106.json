Air Force Life Cycle Management Center personnel are included in Budget Program Activity Code 664127 and Air Force Fight Test Center personnel are included in Budget Program Activity Code 6606TS.  \n\nThe Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) equips U.S. and allied forces with operational weapon systems in support of military and national security operations.  The acquisition and product support workforce provides cutting edge weapon systems, sustainment capabilities, and is charged with providing management, tools, and technical and business capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs throughout their life cycle.  The direct funded acquisition workforce funded in this program element will support all phases of acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel.  This program element supports both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

The FY20 budgeted Average Work Year Cost (AWYC) is $144,474. The $1.102M decrease is due to an AWYC decrease of $1.202M and a non-civilian pay upward adjustment of $0.100M. The AWYC decreased $31.632K per authorization due to a shift in demographics as more personnel are retiring within this PEC and being replaced with lower grade trainees and new hires."

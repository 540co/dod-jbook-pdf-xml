            "val": "This program funds multi-domain, multi-Intelligence (multi-INT) research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) efforts in support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and 2018 DoD Artificial Intelligence Strategy, as applied by the Air Force in the Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan.  Specifically, Program 0305206F provides authorized and appropriated funding to multi-INT RDT&E efforts for utilization on airborne platforms. This program traditionally provides a venue for integration of technologies matured in both the Advanced Technology and Sensors(0604257F) and Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (0304260F) program elements.\n\nAccording to the 2018 NDS, \"we are facing an increasingly complex security environment as defined by ... adversaries in every operating domain.\u201d  Additionally, to ensure (operations) sustainment while under persistent multi-domain attack, the Air Force has applied the NDS in the Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan.  The future ISR portfolio will \"consist of a multi-domain, multi-intelligence,\u201d systems to \"remain confident across the entire conflict spectrum.\u201d  The Airborne Reconnaissance PE is integral to developing multi-domain, multi-INT systems capable of sustaining warfighter decisive advantage through all ranges of military operations, up to highly contested environments (HCE).\n\nThe Airborne Reconnaissance System (ARS) Program matures, develops, demonstrates, and rapidly transitions: next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensors, and both active and passive capabilities.  ARS includes sensor data processing for multiple airborne platforms, in addition to sensor products aiding assisted target recognition algorithms and other artificial intelligence activities (e.g., geolocation models, sensor based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).  ARS provides for modeling & simulation, training and multi-INT systems engineering. This program also coordinates common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real-time multi-domain ISR development.\n\nThe ARS Program includes the following efforts:  Next Generation Sensors efforts lead advancements in multi-INT, platform agnostic capability.  The Next Generation Sensors (NGS) project is developing, demonstrating, and maturing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor suites in a platform agnostic environment. Sensor suites will include open architectures to further enable platform mobility and tech refresh as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to enable assisted target detection and identification. Efforts include but are not limited to, Triple Raven multi-GEOINT High Altitude Advanced Technology Demonstration, multi-INT Common Open Architecture Reconnaissance Programs Standard (MI-COARPS), and Assisted Target Recognition for ISR (ATRI).  Agile ISR includes Detection Removal and Characterization Operations developing a robust image quality improvement capability for airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) products.  Sensors Open Systems Architecture (SOSA) coordinates advanced technologies, and open architecture development for multi-INT sensor modalities. The program includes development of a family of government owned, open, platform agnostic pods - the AgilePod Family. Sensor Development includes Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) front end antenna array and receiver exciter advancements (ASARS-2B) and back end processor advancements (ASARS-2C).  ASARS-2B follow on RDT&E extends range, enhances Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) performance and introduces maritime capability while laying in the framework for future use of open architectures. ASARS-2C effort extends the functionality and performance of ASARS-2B through the addition of advanced radar capabilities by enabling use of third party vendor solutions and multi-platform integration.  ASARS is the radar solution for Next Generation Sensors efforts.  JTC supports ISR Training Systems Integration Laboratories.  Gorgon Stare Wide Area Motion Imagery research, development, test and evaluation.  Data Compression efforts are led by Reduction of Data Using Compression Enhancement (RDUCE).  RDUCE develops data compression algorithms, addressing current and future date dissemination systems' bandwidth limitations.  Consistent with NDS, algorithms are multi-INT sensor agnostic that are submitted for formal adoption by the DoD-Intelligence Community (IC) Joint Enterprise Standards Committee (JESC) GEOINT standards groups.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Efforts include but are not limited to, Triple Raven multi-GEOINT High Altitude Advanced Technology Demonstration, multi-INT Common Open Architecture Reconnaissance Program Standard (MI-COARPS), Assisted Target Recognition for ISR (ATRI), and radar open architecture development in support of ASARS-2B\/2C.\n\nNGS program efforts are set by capabilities gaps within the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and as approved by the Capabilities Decision Memorandum (Signed Jan 2019). These requirements have been further verified, modeled, and developed through the Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and the Triple Raven ATD, which was approved by the Advanced Technology Council (ATC) in FY19. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly upgrade\/iterate advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for remotely piloted aircraft through development of abstraction interfaces for sense (such as RADAR, ADS-B, TCAS, Next Generation Sensors, ASIP, and ASARS) and avoid logic. \n\nThis project also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The SOSA project also increases interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces, as well as leveraging industry participation toward creating COTS solutions such as common C4ISR processor, AgilePOD interfaces, Red\/Black separation on the sensor, data at rest, and security\/AT with industry partners and other DoD services. \n\nThis project is designed to support development of the Next Generation Sensors program, as well as other AFLCMC\/WI emerging and program of record needs. As part of the development effort SOSA will be funding and supporting first article development of key open architecture solutions to validate\/verify open specifications as well as to prime the COTS vendors development strategies. The SOSA effort has stood up AFLCMC SIL (System Integration Laboratory) for Sensors Open System Architectures in order to establish a strong conformance\/compliance program with industry partners for COTS products, in partnership with other DoD services.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.\n\nThe funds in this project are distributed in priority order, as supported by the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and set by the GCWG, for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the ASI AoA as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

The Sensors Development efforts advance the capability of ASARS for U-2 employment, and is a critical component for the multi-INT Next Generation Sensors, project 672001, efforts.  ASARS-2B (front-end) & ASARS-2C (back-end) efforts provide critical advancements and risk reduction in SAR\/Moving Target Indication capability to be implemented in the future multi-INT, platform agnostic capability that Next Generation Sensors will provide. \n\nThe ASARS effort is a fifth generation, deep-look, high-altitude, ISR radar that is the foundation for the radar component of the Next Generation Sensors (NGS) family of systems as outlined in the  AFROC approved ASARS-2C draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD).  ASARS-2B (front-end) is the antenna and receiver exciter replacement.  The ASARS-2C (back end) data processing efforts extend the ASARS-2B (front-end) radar capability using open architecture data processing and multi-platform integration.  Open architecture improves performance and lowers cost by facilitating and enabling qualified third party software vendors to incorporate future multi-ISR capability to advance interoperability across joint operations. ASARS increases current capability and addresses National Defense Strategy Key Operational Problems and ISR Dominance flight plan.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force training application. The MUSE\/AFSERS is a software suite that simulates UAS\/RPA (e.g., MQ-9) systems, tailored air vehicle & data links, and visualization systems used for payload product outputs-including Full Motion Video (FMV), Fixed Frame Imagery (FFI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data, and Link 16 (J2.2 and J3.5) tracking messages.  Outputs are compliant with applicable DoD standards and are continually tested against actual ground data processors to ensure DoD systems interoperability.  \n\nThe Services and Combatant Commanders have a requirement for training with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple domain systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations.  The MUSE creates a realistic operational environment supporting military utility assessment, architecture, and employment concept development.  Training, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) refinement, practice Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) of multi-domain information.  Conduct emerging concepts experimentation, optimizing Command, Control, Communications, and Computing (C4) with warfighting exercises and experiments. MUSE is the preferred UAS\/RPA simulation system used by US Combatant Commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4 training.\n\nThe MUSE also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for new UAS\/RPA system Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts.  MUSE conducts emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4 training optimization.\n\nMUSE is currently used by all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M\/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite systems, P-3, E-8 and the U-2 during warfighting exercises.  The AFSERS provides National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) information for simulated data collection systems, supporting PED training.  The MUSE is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.  Most of the MUSE\/AFSERS software suite components are also used in multiple airborne platform system training devices.  Including the MQ-9 [Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical (MALET) JSIL Aircrew Trainer (MJAT)] and RQ-4 [Global Hawk Sensor Operator Part Task Trainer (GHSOPTT), and Global Hawk Weapon System Trainer (WST)].\n\nThe Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is the training center of excellence supporting UAS and RPA programs for the Services.  JTC\/SIL provides the system engineering, test and integration, interoperability, rapid technology insertion to address MUSE training requirements.  The JTC\/SIL combines the UAS\/RPA knowledge of communications standards (such as STANAGs 4586, 4607, 4545 and 4609) with Hardware in the Loop (HIL) testing, MUSE, integrating with other DoD modeling and simulation (M&S) architectures.  For those airborne assets normally not available for training, the JTC\/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces.  The JTC\/SIL contributes to the distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, and are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture.  The JTC\/SIL continues to develop leading edge technologies supporting the rapidly evolving UAS\/RPA training requirements required to support NDS future fighting force.\n\nMUSE project funds may be utilized to cover the GCWG Secretariat, studies and analysis activities, supporting current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

The Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) approved Air Combat Command's recommendation to transition Gorgon Stare from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to an Air Force Enduring Capability in November 2014. Gorgon Stare's requirements are documented in the Gorgon Stare Wide Area Airborne Sensor Capabilities Production Document (draft). The acquisition strategy for this Air Force podded sensor suite solution is sustainment of the currently fielded capabilities with any upgrades implemented via validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.\n\nDevelopment efforts conducted with FY 2015 Congressionally-added funds included efforts focused primarily on the development of a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability in support of an Urgent Operational Need. Development efforts conducted with FY 2016 Congressionally-added RDT&E funds included further development and system integration lab testing of Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Gorgon Stare Increment 2 Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors. Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for future airborne integration efforts as required. Development efforts conducted with FY 2017 Congressionally-added funds further progressed efforts associated with BLOS, to include first article testing for phase 1 and a limited BLOS capability delivered to the field in FY2019. Development efforts conducted with FY 2018 Congressional added funds included further development of the next phase of BLOS to enable freedom of maneuverability and development of system imagery improvements. Development efforts conducted with FY 2019 Congressionally added funds included completion of BLOS Phase II system design and aircraft certification to enable full freedom on maneuverability, completing imagery improvements and continuation of data automation through Area of Interest (AOI) tagging and tracking efforts. Development efforts to be conducted with FY2020 Congressionally added funds include but are not limited to continuation of tagging and tracking efforts, development of an electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) fusion capability, and development of tip and cue airborne cueing.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Gorgon Stare capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

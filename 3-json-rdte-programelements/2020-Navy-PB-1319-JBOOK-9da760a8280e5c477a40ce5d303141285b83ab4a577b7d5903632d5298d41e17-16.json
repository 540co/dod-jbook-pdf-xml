This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nThis PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

For the Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV), the project will radically change the way the Navy does mine influence sweep, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and electronic warfare (EW) missions; it will introduce larger unmanned surface vehicles (USV) to the Navy; and it will introduce advanced autonomy to the surface Navy."

The primary research efforts within this activity are focused on advanced technology development for Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicles in support of Naval S&T Focus Area on Autonomy and Unmanned Vehicles and At-Sea Vertical Launch System rearming. Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicle (USSV) technology development includes autonomous navigation for USSVs. Also funded in this activity is the Energy System Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP), which promotes innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities for naval personnel and student veterans through advanced technology development and demonstration projects at naval facilities and laboratories. Program goals include: advance dual-use and naval-unique technologies that increase operational capabilities and efficiencies; leverage commercial technologies and private investments to provide warfighter capability at reduced cost; and evaluate innovative technologies from naval laboratories and startup companies."

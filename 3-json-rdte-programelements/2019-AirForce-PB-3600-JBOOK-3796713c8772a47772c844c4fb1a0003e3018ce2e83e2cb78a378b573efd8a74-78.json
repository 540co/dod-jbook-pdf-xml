        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three dimensional positioning\/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec. 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.\n\nThe system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under PE 1203164F), Space (funded under this PE, 1203165F, and PE 1203269F) and a Control Network (funded under PE 1203165F and PE 1206423F). The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.\n\nGPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) supporting the GPS constellation and is funded in PE 1203265F and PE 1203269F. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and a growth path to full warfighter capabilities. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production & Deployment Phase.\n\nPE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) of GPS III SVs 01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This PE includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).  \n\nStarting in FY2019 PE 1203269F will fund the RDT&E of GPS III Follow-On SVs 11 and 12 which will include Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support efforts. This production design activity includes risk-reducing simulators and systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS III Follow-On SVs, including backward compatibility, dual band Telemetry, Tracking and Control (TT&C), integration of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hosted payloads, a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, and Regional Military Protection (RMP) which provides the ability to deliver high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals in specific areas of intended effect.\n\nSpace Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base supply.  The Air Force (AF) is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which will provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Science & Technology (S&T) funding and PE 1203265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads and inform future PNT architectures.\n\nMission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures, and procurement of special support equipment.\n\nGPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet the congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchases to M-Code capable receivers starting in FY2017. The funds will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with OCX, supports Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.\n\nImpacts of the M-Code deployment include:\n- Compliance with Commander, Air Force Space Command mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for Early M-Code Operational Use and verification of Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) effects.\n- Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.\n- Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and deployed properly.\n- Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE\/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding\n\nThe feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded with this budget item will determine whether or not an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance and resiliency through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation. This augmentation to the GPS constellation enables future rapid technology on-ramps with minimal risk.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GPS III Space Segment weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis PE encompasses the GPS III (SV 01-10), COps, MCEU, M-Code Hosted Payload, and prior to FY2019, GPS III Follow-On Production Readiness effort.\n\nThis program is a Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current and subsequent fiscal year."

The implementation of a U.S. Medium Earth Orbiting (MEO) SAR Space Segment is via a Canadian-provided 406 MHz SAR repeater on GPS III SVs. This system presents a cost effective, low-risk opportunity that accommodates existing and planned 406 MHz beacons across the globe. Per National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-39, USAF and United States Coast Guard (USCG), the U.S. operators of the civil Cosmicheskaya Sistyema Poiska Avariynich Sudov-Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (COSPAS\/SARSAT) system, and the international SAR system will integrate the Canadian provided SAR repeater into GPS III beginning no earlier than SV 11.\n\nSAR\/GPS funds are transferred to GPS III SPAF beginning in FY19."

GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and a growth path to full warfighter capabilities. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production & Deployment Phase.\n\nPE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) of GPS III SVs 01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This program includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).  \n\nMission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures, and procurement of special support equipment.\n\nSpace Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. Phase 1 will address a GPS Enterprise Analysis of Alternative (AoA) recommendations to increase GPS signal strength from space by maturing navigation payload technologies that include a new regional Military Code (M-Code) capability. The Air Force (AF) is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which will provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort will be funded with AFRL's Science & Technology (S&T) funding, PE 1203265F, and starting in FY2019 PE 1203269F to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads.\n\nGPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet a congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchase to M-Code capable receivers starting in FY2017. The funds will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with GPS OCX, supports Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.\n\nImpacts of the M-Code deployment include:\n- Compliance with Commander, Air Force Space Command mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for Early M-Code Operational Use and verification of Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) effects.\n- Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.\n- Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and deployed properly.\n- Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE\/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding\n\nThe feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded by this budget item will determine whether or not an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation.\n\nThis PE encompasses the GPS III (SVs 01-10), COps, MCEU, M-Code Hosted Payload, and prior to FY2019, GPS III Follow-On Production Readiness effort."

                            "val": "The GPS III next generation space segment (SV01-10) rapidly and affordably responds to warfighter capability requirements. The acquisition approach utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower risk incremental delivery of mature technologies. This approach focuses on mission success and on time delivery. The GPS III SVs will have GPS IIF capabilities plus up to a 3x-8x increase in anti-jam signal power, 3x improved accuracy, 3+ year increased design life, a new civil (L1C) signal compatible with the European Galileo system and a satellite bus capable of supporting future SV capability additions.\n\nThe AF is starting a new program for the second phase of the two-phased GPS III Follow-On production acquisition strategy for SVs 11-32 with SAF\/AQ as the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment provided data and insight into contractors' GPS III production designs with emphasis on a mature navigation payload and production-ready designs. Phase 1 results affirmed the viability of a competitive approach for Phase 2. The Phase 2 strategy transfers funding to PE 1203269F to conduct a full-and-open competition for 22 GPS III Follow-On SVs and specifies the use of RDT&E funds to deliver SVs 11 and 12, and conduct associated Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE). Upon Milestone C approval, the AF will procure SVs 13-32 via annual contract options exercised using Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF) funds consistent with full-funding policy under an annual buy approach. In addition to SVs 11 and 12, the RDT&E effort will be comprised of developing risk reducing simulators, support test equipment, and conducting the systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS III Follow-On SVs 11-32 including backward compatibility, dual band Telemetry, Tracking and Control (TT&C), integration of GFE hosted payloads including a redesigned NDS payload, SAR\/GPS payload, LRA, and RMP, which provides the ability to deliver high-power regional M-Code signals in specific areas of intended effect.  RDT&E funding for SVs 11 and 12 will be in PE 1203269F, Project GPS III Follow-On.  SPAF funding for SVs 13-32 will be in PE 1203269F, Project GPS III Follow-On beginning in FY2020.\n\nThe AF is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which will provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort will be funded with AFRL's S&T funding, PE 1203265F, and starting in FY2019 PE 1203269F to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads and inform future PNT architectures.\n\nOn 19 July 2016 the Program Executive Officer (PEO) Space, approved the Acquisition Strategy Document (ASD) for the Contingency Operations (COps) effort. The strategy utilizes contingency constellation sustainment capability for GPS III Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). GPS III COps is needed because GPS OCX will not deliver in time to support initial GPS III SV operations. COps operates (post-launch and check-out) GPS III SVs at the capability level of GPS IIR-M or GPS IIF using the existing Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP) control segment.\n\nOn 21 Jan 2017, the PEO Space, approved the ASD for the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program. The MCEU acquisition strategy, when executed, will enable the GPS Enterprise to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter prior to GPS OCX delivery. MCEU will also support the scheduled operational testing of MGUE. MCEU will update the GPS control segment software, AEP, to allow for command and control, processing, and integrity monitoring of the M-Code signal. MCEU will acquire this capability by using the existing GPS III prime contract vehicle to modify the operational AEP software.\n\nHQ USAF\/A5R approved reinstatement of a previously deferred Key Support Area (KSA) on 10 Feb 2016. The MSTIC receivers currently under development will get a software upgrade to process M-Code data. This $7.96M project to procure the M-MSTIC receivers is being funded through 3400\/SPAF funds in FY2016-FY2018. Performance monitoring, integration and test will be conducted by the MCEU program and sustained under the GPL Lockheed Martin Contract. Funding is sent through a Form-9 from DoD to Lockheed Martin."

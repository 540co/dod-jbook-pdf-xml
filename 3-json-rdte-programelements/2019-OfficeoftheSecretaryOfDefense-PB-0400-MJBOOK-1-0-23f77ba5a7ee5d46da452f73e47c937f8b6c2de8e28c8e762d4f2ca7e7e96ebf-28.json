                            "val": "Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element (PE) has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high-priority Test and Evaluation (T&E) capabilities for joint\/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other Government agencies T&E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP PE support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).\n\n    The JIM funds critically needed T&E investments in the major functional areas of air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; cyber warfare; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments. Examples of project subject matter include highly accurate time-space-position information, electronic warfare test capability developments to address critical testing shortfalls against advanced threats, infrastructure developments needed for testing hypersonic weapon systems, network enhanced telemetry, information assurance and cyber testing and analysis capabilities, end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasures systems, net-centric weapons, and unmanned systems.  CTEIP continues to serve as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and linkages between test and training ranges. \n\n   CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) as a practical test tool, to link ranges to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing, and to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.\n\n   Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.\n\nThe REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high-priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.\n\n   This Budget Activity 6 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.\n\nThe FY2019 CTEIP budget is described in detail below. As part of the DoD reform agenda, the CTEIP budget was reduced for consolidation and reduction of service contracts. The FY2019 includes increased investments in high-priority hypersonic ground and open air range test capability developments and increased investments for critically needed upgrades to DoD Threat Models and Simulations."

This Program addresses capability needs in airbase defense, precision strike and aircraft protect capabilities. The Directed Energy Prototyping Program bridges the gap between technology demonstration and successful acquisition and operation or operational capability implementation.\n\nPrototyping enables integration, test, evaluation and demonstration of emerging weapon technologies as a bridge between the laboratory and the warfighter. The Directed Energy Prototyping Program allows acquisition program managers (capability developers) and warfighters (capability recipients and end users) to prototype, integrate, evaluate, and demonstrate candidate weapon technologies and assess them in an operational environment in partnership with Program Executive officers, schoolhouses, simulation facilities, major commands, combatant commands, and developmental planning organizations. \n\nThe Directed Energy Prototyping Program Element is new for FY 2019.  In FY 2019, the entirety of Directed Energy Prototyping efforts was transferred from PE 0604858F, Technology Transition Program, Project 645351, Prototyping, in order to provide increased transparency to Congress on Air Force Prototyping activities as directed in the Department of Defense Appropriation Act 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start.\n\nIn addition, this program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapon system capability. It may also include necessary civilian pay expenses required to perform analysis and developmental activities required in support of the transition of weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

As reflected in the new guidance in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 025-19 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS) on April 15, 2019, DoD will update the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual to make it standard practice to include the requirements for exportability in a system's capability requirements documents"

            "val": "The DEF program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs.  Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activities such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance.  Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities.\n\nDefense exportability features play a critically important role in DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. \n\nExperience has shown that failure to identify the full range of Critical Program Information (CPI) early in a DoD program's design phase can drive major affordability and schedule problems later when programs have to \"retrofit\" program protection measures prior to export.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends and may enhance US industry share of the global\nmarketplace."

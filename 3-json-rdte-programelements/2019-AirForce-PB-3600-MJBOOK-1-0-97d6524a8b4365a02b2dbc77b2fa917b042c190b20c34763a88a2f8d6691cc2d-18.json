            "val": "The Technology Transition Program provides funding to demonstrate, prototype, and experiment with technologies and concepts to enable or accelerate their transition to acquisition programs and\/or operational use. The Technology Transition Program addresses the gap between initial technology or concept development and demonstration, and successful acquisition and operational capability implementation. Experimentation explores new concepts and their applications in potential future operating environments within a system-of-systems context. Prototyping enables integration and demonstration of emerging technologies as a bridge between the laboratory and the warfighter. The Technology Transition Program allows acquisition program managers (the capability developers) and warfighters (the capability recipients and end users) to prototype, integrate, and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment in partnership with Program Executive Officers, schoolhouses, simulation facilities, and development planning organizations. \n\nIn addition, this program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nFor FY 2019, Project 645351, Prototyping, was split into Project 645351, Prototyping; Project 645345, Hypersonics Prototyping; and Project 643608, Advanced Engine Development to provide increased transparency to Congress on prototyping activities within PE 0604858F, Technology Transition Program.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The main effort in this project is the Adaptive Engine Transition Program, which is maturing fuel efficient adaptive engine component technologies and reducing associated risk in preparation for next-generation propulsion system development for multiple combat aircraft applications. Adaptive engine technology enables next generation combat aircraft capabilities by combining the efficiency of high bypass turbofans used by commercial airlines with the performance demanded of military fighter engines. This technology has undergone initial development under the auspices of the Air Force Research Laboratory through the Adaptive Engine Technology and Adaptive Engine Technology Demonstrator programs.\n\nProject 643608, Advanced Engine Development is new for FY 2019. Previous to FY 2019, the entirety of work under this project was reported in Project 645351, Prototyping, under the Adaptive Engine Transition Program effort in PE 0604858F, Tech Transition Program. This is administrative realignment to provide increase transparency to Congress and not a new start."

By producing flight-weight prototypes, the program will demonstrate adaptive engine technology can be scaled to meet military fighter engine size requirements, while ensuring appropriate manufacturing- and technology-readiness levels. By performing sea-level, altitude, and durability assessments across multiple power settings, the prototype engines will demonstrate fuel efficiency increases, thrust increases, and new component technologies. These assessments will provide data to quantify the capability and reduce risk in areas such as thermal capacity, reliability, and supportability, among others."

Under this project, Air-Launched Rapid response Weapon (ARRW) and Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW) will accelerate the technology transfer of hypersonic technologies to enable a responsive, long range strike capability.\n\nProject 645345, Hypersonics Prototyping, is new for FY 2019. In FY 2018, the entirety of this project was previously reported in Project 645351, Prototyping, under the Lifecycle Prototyping effort.

Concepts and enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, directed energy weapons and multi-domain operations hold great promise, yet their transition to acquisition programs and fielded capabilities is typically hampered due to uncertainties regarding their military application and organizational implications. Implementing successful transition approaches for complex and widely applicable concepts requires a comprehensive and coordinated campaign of learning. Experimentation campaigns enable organizational learning through the methodical and systematic application of experimentation and supporting analysis. Experimentation campaigns are centered on an operational level warfighting concept to provide context for assessment, and use wargaming, simulation, and field experimentation to evolve, refine, and validate the warfighting concept leading to solid, evidentiary-based materiel and non-materiel capability development approaches with associated recommendations. Experimentation campaigns improve the effectiveness of operations by developing concepts and generating new information to address challenging threats of the future which aids the fielding of advanced technologies by providing the credible evidence decision makers need to make sound strategic decisions and investment choices. Experimentation campaigns are directed by the Air Force Capability Development Council to ensure funding supports the highest Air Force priorities. Further details can be provided in the appropriate forum.\n\nIn FY 2017, this project was named Transition Prioritization and included both Experimentation and Prototyping activities. In FY 2018, this project was renamed to Experimentation, and Prototyping activities such as Hypersonics Prototyping were transferred from this project to Project 645351, Prototyping, Lifecycle Prototyping effort."

Prototyping efforts funded from this Project will aim to capitalize on various emerging warfighter technology areas such as cyber weapons, novel aircraft technology, or directed energy weapons. \n\nPrototyping enables a key linkage between research and development in the lab and fielding advanced technologies to the warfighter. Under this project, the Adaptive Engine Transition Program will serve as a model prototyping effort to reestablish the Air Force's experimentation and prototyping culture. The Adaptive Engine Transition Program is maturing fuel-efficient, adaptive-cycle engine technologies and demonstrating flight-weight, prototype adaptive engines. In addition, the Spectral Halo, Space Internet Prototyping, and Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology efforts will build upon proof of concept work completed at the Air Force Research Lab. This project will also support other prototyping efforts in the future, enabling similar emerging technology transitions.\n\nFor FY 2019, Project 645351, Prototyping, was split into Project 645351, Prototyping; Project 645345, Hypersonics Prototyping; and Project 643608, Advanced Engine Development to provide increased transparency to Congress on prototyping activities within PE 0604858F, Technology Transition Program.

The RIF Program accelerates the fielding of innovative technologies into military systems via a competitive, merit-based selection process.  Technology innovations are drawn from Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) projects, defense laboratory and academia efforts, and other innovative technologies, including dual-use and Independent Research & Development (IRAD) technologies.  Projects stimulate innovation, mitigate technical risks, reduce acquisition and\/or lifecycle costs, improve test outcomes, and rapidly insert technology into major acquisition programs and other programs that meet critical national security needs.  RIF provides a mechanism for bridging the \u201cValley of Death\u201d by funding the integration work vital to transition technologies out of the laboratory and into Programs of Record.  Since inception, RIF has evaluated over 18,000 industry submitted white papers and funded over 800 projects with companies from 43 different states across the 30 different organizations in the Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other Defense Agencies."

RIF is executed via a competitive two-step process for participation in the program.  Industry is invited to submit three-page white papers plus a quad chart through an annual Broad Agency Announcement.  Once white papers have been reviewed, the highest ranking white papers are invited to submit full detailed proposals for funding consideration.  In ranking white papers, preference will be given to projects focusing on the Research and Engineering top 10 research priorities, the National Defense Strategy, and small businesses.  Full proposals are subject to final review and the highest ranking proposals are selected for contract award.  The statute for RIF defines project scope as not to exceed 24 months and $3.000 million per project."

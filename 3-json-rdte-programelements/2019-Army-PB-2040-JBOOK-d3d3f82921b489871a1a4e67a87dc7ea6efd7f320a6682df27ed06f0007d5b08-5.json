LRPF provides responsive engagement of high value point and area targets by Army and Joint Force Commanders under all weather conditions, at operational ranges defended by enemy air-defense systems.  An AoA supporting the MS A decision was completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with an OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015. In 4QFY16, the Army awarded 9 month risk reduction, trade study and initial design development agreements to two contractors. The effort resulted in development of initial baseline designs presented during final technical reviews that resulted in a seamless transition into the TMRR phase. Subsequent to MS A approval on 31 March 2017, the Army awarded TMRR agreements to two contractors. \n\nTMRR is ongoing and includes risk reduction activities and further maturation of contractor design concepts. Both contractors will participate in a PDR and build four (4) missile prototypes culminating in flight tests to provide demonstration of their system capabilities. Both contractors will continue risk reduction activities allowing the contractors to mature their tactical designs through the Critical Design Review (CDR), conduct component and system level Engineering Development Test (EDT) qualification activities, conduct critical missile survivability assessments, and ensure risk mitigation activities support transition to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). Component level testing during TMRR, results of prototype flight tests, and results of EDT flight tests will inform the Source Selection. The EMD phase will complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and a Limited User Test (LUT)."

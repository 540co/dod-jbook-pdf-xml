AEC is the lead agent to plan, direct and evaluate all required program testing. AEC is the focal point in test strategy development, system safety verification, and data analyses from early developmental consumer tests through operational tests. AEC provides critical independent assessments on the effectiveness, suitability, and survivability to include cyber and electronic warfare; safety of materiel solutions; and viability of emerging technologies and engineering change proposals in order to support major acquisition\/fielding decisions including but not limited to acquisition milestones, materiel changes, and materiel releases.  \n\nAEC is responsible for all assigned developmental and independent operational evaluation of Army materiel, information and acquisition systems, an inherently governmental mission. AEC assists the Chief of Staff of the Army decision making process by supporting Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) processes as well as supporting the Army Futures Command through the Cross Functional Team (CFT) concept. AEC evaluates operational effectiveness by determining if the system provides intended benefits to the Force. AEC determines impacts to readiness through Human Systems Integration (HSI), Unit Systems Integration (USI), and Army Systems Integration (ASI), DOTMLPF-P impacts, integrated suitability reviews (ISR) and operational suitability reviews (OSR) in partnership with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Policy and Logistics (DASA APL). AEC evaluates ballistics survivability and lethality missions, adversarial assessments\/threat computer network operations, cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (CVPA), and electronic warfare (EW) (attack, support) countermeasures in support of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2016 Section 1647, Establishment of Cybersecurity and Electromagnetic Affects (CEMA). AEC manages, plans, and executes Information Assurance (IA) operational assessments during annual Combatant Command and Army Service exercises in support of the congressionally mandated Office of the Secretary of Defense Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD DOT&E) assessment, and performs the operational test agency (OTA) duties for the Ballistic Missile Defense System.\n\nThis PE funds direct civilian labor and minimum non-labor requirements to include: Temporary Duty (TDY), personnel training, career development, supplies and equipment, hardware, software, and other external Other Government Agency (OGA) support as well as methodology development required to evaluate emerging technologies and instrumentation requirements.\n\nAEC consists of seven directorates (Aviation-Fires Evaluation Directorate, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Evaluation Directorate (funded by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Evaluation Directorate, Integrated Suitability & Methodology Directorate, Mounted Systems Evaluation Directorate, Soldier & Support System Evaluation Directorate and Survivability Evaluation Directorate) and a lean headquarters element as AEC receives staff services from the Army Test and Evaluation Command Headquarters (ATEC HQ). The AEC primary competencies are: identify what decision makers need to know; plan and direct test and evaluation strategies; evaluate operational effectiveness, suitability, survivability and safety; and provide senior leadership unbiased advice on Army programs."

            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 January 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nActivities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications\/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.\n\nThe increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 reflects an increase in the level of effort for the new Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command & Control (EMC2) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) Program. \n\nThe decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 reflects the realignment of the EMC2 Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) designated program to PE 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Advanced Technology Development where all of the INP\/LA-Tech investments are being consolidated.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

The apertures are capable of providing multiple simultaneous, independent beams which can together perform any of the above functions.\n\nThe major objectives of this activity are:\n\na) Submarine SATCOM Array - Develop wide-band SATCOM array capable of supporting EW for submarines.\n\nb) Electronic Warfare (EW)\/Information Operations (IO)\/Line of Sight (LOS) Communications (Comms) for Surface Combatants - Develop wide-band array to support EW capability and other functions, including but not limited to IO and LOS Comms, for surface combatants with potential application to other platforms.\n\nc) Architecture, Standards and Devices - Develop architecture and standards for wide-band multi-beam, multi-band arrays and below deck systems and the technology and electronic devices needed to make integrated array systems affordable.\n\nd) Surface Combatant Communication Array - Develop wide-band surface combatant communication array capable of supporting other RF functions.\n\ne) Resource Allocation Manager - Develop enterprise common Resource Allocation Manager.\n\nf) Digital Radar - Develop an all digital radar to demonstrate advanced concepts for coherent radar networking and control, which will increase radar coverage and provide new levels of electronic protection (EP), while maximizing radar resources and reducing cost.\n\ng) Low Band Communications, IO and EW - Develop low band technology development and concept studies leading to development of an Advanced Development Model (ADM).\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

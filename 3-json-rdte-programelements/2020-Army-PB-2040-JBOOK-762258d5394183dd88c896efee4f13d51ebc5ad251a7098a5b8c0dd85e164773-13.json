                            "val": "The Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA) program is the foundation architecture of the Live Training Transformation Family of Training Systems (LT2-FTS). The program contains critical core product-line architecture which provides commonality across training instrumentation systems and interoperability across Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE) and joint training systems. CTIA includes Army owned software components, architecture services, standards, protocols and governance used by domain-specific Live Training Transformation (LT2) and Live Training Systems (LTS) to include instrumented Force-On-Force (FOF) and Force-On-Target (FOT) training requirements. The CTIA also provides Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) and technology refresh for the LT2 family of LTS supporting over 22 live instrumented training products which are fielded at over 200 CONUS and OCONUS sites across the Army.\n\nCombat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) funds the continued development of the existing Instrumentation Systems (IS) at the National Training Center (NTC), Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) and Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC). CTC-IS funds the continued development of the Range Communication System at the NTC and JRTC, to provide high-fidelity live, virtual, and constructive brigade training rotations which prepare Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint partners, and supporting units to deploy in support of the Army Sustainable Readiness Model (SRM).  The CTCs primary goal is to develop agile and adaptive leaders at the tactical, operational and strategic levels while providing BCTs the core training necessary to conduct decisive action in a dynamic operating environment.  \n\nThe Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) program provides realistic, real-time casualty effects for force-on-force tactical engagement training scenarios. Its ability to integrate into training instrumentation systems provides for high fidelity combined arms combat exercises supporting the 39th Chief of the Staff of the Army's #1 priority of \"Readiness\" and the closely aligns with the Modernization priority of Soldier Lethality.  I-MILES is required for use at Home Stations, the Combat Training Centers (CTCs) and in theater of operations to meet force-on-force training requirements. I-MILES program funding provides for the Development and Integration of new vehicle and dismount weapon systems meeting the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirements, as well as embedded Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES) development. This includes development efforts of the Live Training Engagement Composition (LTEC), increasing simulation by updating the Probability of Kill (Pk) tables for increased training realism and improved integration on new weapon platforms (i.e. Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), Next Generation Combat vehicle, M4A2 plus Rifle and Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) with 30mm Gun).\n\nThe Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) currently provides a high-fidelity deployable instrumented training capability to support platoon thru battalion ground based Soldiers and vehicles in Force-on-Force Training. HITS tracks location of soldiers and vehicles and simulates weapons' effects and engagements, allowing units to \"Train as they Fight\" against live opponents. HITS provides accurate feedback to training units. HITS consists of light deployable components that can be rapidly assembled\/disassembled and transported to support deployed training. HITS is a member of the Live Training Transformation (LT2) product line of training systems implementing hardware and software reuse with other Instrumentation Systems (IS). HITS provides the only Live training component for the large scale Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) military training exercises. HITS begins US Army aviation vehicle integration with Home Station instrumentation to cover comprehensive training engagements between ground and air forces. \n\nThe Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) provides realistic medical training to both medical and non-medical Soldiers in the Active, Reserve, and National Guard. MSTCs provide hands-on instruction on the latest battlefield trauma and critical care techniques based on Army Medical Department (AMEDD) approved performance oriented Program of Instruction (POI). Medical treatment validation exercises simulate the high stress of performing medical interventions in combat. MSTC supports Unit Medical Readiness by validating Combat Medic (68W) Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) biennial recertification requirements and provides Combat Lifesaver (CLS) training to non-medical Soldiers.\n\nThe Basic Electronics Maintenance Trainer (BEMT) provides the essential modernized electronic system maintenance training capability for the Army, Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve to achieve Military Occupational Specialty-Qualification (MOS-Q) for 40 MOS at 24 Active, National Guard, and Army Reserve camps, posts, and stations. Soldiers utilizing the BEMT system receive highly realistic training using scenarios requiring performance of basic electronic tasks in a virtual environment including tests, diagnosis, and repair while saving institutions significant expenses over live training alternatives.  The Army identified the need for modernization of electronics maintenance training.  Electronics maintenance is a critical skill, directly contributing to the overall Army mission accomplishment.\n\nThe Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) provides a net-centric linkage that collects, retrieves and exchanges data among LVC Training Aids, Devices, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS) (to include: AVCATT, CCTT, GFT, HITS, JLCCTC and SE Core) and Mission Command Systems. The LVC-IA defines \"how\" information is exchanged among the different LVC domains and the Mission Command Systems. The LVC-IA provides enterprise level tools for exercise control, after action review, and system information assurance. It develops hardware and software to interface the different Live, Virtual, Constructive and Gaming communication protocols and to provide a correlated common operating picture for the training audience on their organic Mission Command equipment. The integration of the LVC TADSS with the Mission Command equipment will enable larger and more robust training events, to better prepare U.S. Soldiers for their missions at an overall reduced cost. The end-state goal is to enable an LVC Integrated Training Environment that can replicate Operational Environments in a cost effective manner to provide a high level of value-added training and mission rehearsal opportunities to Army Commanders and their Soldiers. In FY18, the LVC-IA program began design and developmental activities for Version 4 which allowed for Web-based optimization; inclusion of new simulations to the architecture; and concurrency with core system TADSS and Army Mission Command Systems and will continue in FY19 through FY21. FY20 request will continue Version 4 developmental and integration activities (Web-based optimization and Synthetic Training Environment (STE) compatibility), and will continue concurrency with mission command systems.\n\nThe Target Modernization program provides a common open architectural framework, standards, specifications, and interfaces for live fire target devices, a common target control system for all range types, and innovative technologies to enhance training realism and reduce life cycle costs on the ranges. The Target Modernization program's primary innovation goals are the development of trackless moving target systems, high fidelity dynamic infrared representations, non-contact ballistic hit detections, advanced human type targets, and augmented reality on live fire ranges; aimed at increasing training realism and lowering life cycle costs.\n\nThe Integrated Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Training System (IMTS) program fields the Combined Arms Collective Training Facility (CACTF), the Collective Training Facility (CTF), Live Fire Shoot House (LFSH), and the Urban Assault Course (UAC). The IMTS training systems provide instrumentation to enable training and After Action Review (AAR) of Soldier training exercises up to the battalion level combined training for the Active and Reserve Component Army. The CACTF, CTF, and LFSH enable training and AAR under daylight and night vision environments for units training in urban areas, underground environments, and the approaches to these areas.\n\nThe Army identified an operational gap in the training strategy for the OPFOR Integrated Air Defense System (IADS). It is a collection of enemy weapons systems that engages Army aviation assets. Training Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Simulation Suite (TASS) is a live training system consisting of aircraft components and ground emitters that replicates current and emerging enemy Air Defense systems. Its fidelity supports individual pilot training as well as the collective training requirements of the Brigade Combat Team to fully plan, prepare, execute and react against an enemy air defense weapons at the Combat Training Centers (CTC).  \n\nThe Digital Range Training System (DRTS) provides new and modern ranges capable of training, evaluating and stressing Soldiers and their modern equipment in a realistic train-as-you-fight environment. The system consists of four standard training ranges:  Digital Multi-Purpose Range Complex (DMPRC), Digital Multi-Purpose Training Range (DMPTR), Battle Area Complex (BAX) and Digital Air Ground Integration Range (DAGIR) which utilize all available combat systems capabilities, and digitally integrate them to manage all forces undergoing individual and collective live-fire training and qualification. These training systems replicate realistic threat systems, challenge Soldiers, and provide enhanced training data collection and After Action Review (AAR) capabilities. The system provides accurate gunnery qualification information to the training units as well as integrates multiple ranges and training environments.\n\n\nOPFOR Surrogate Wheeled Vehicles (OSWV) provides a collection of wheeled vehicles, used as training aids to portray threat vehicles including tactical vehicles, technical vehicles, and Civilian on the Battlefield vehicles (COB-V). The program supports the CTC OPFOR\/COE Pillar capability through technical vehicles, unique VISMODs, and COB-Vs. This capability provides for an accurate replication of OPFOR and COB-Vs environment that rotational units must train against.\n\nFY 2020 Project 241 funds significant development efforts in support of U.S. Army Training and Readiness on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES), Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), Digital Range Training System (DRTS), Target Modernization, Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), OPFOR Surrogate Wheeled Vehicles (OSWV), Integrated Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Training System (IMTS) new start, and Basic Electronics Maintenance Trainer (BEMT) new start.\n\nFY 2020 funding for Suicide Prevention is realigned to PE 0605013A project FL9.\n\nFY 2020 funding for Soldier\/Squad Virtual Trainer Program (S\/SVT) is realigned to PE 0604121A, Project SV1."

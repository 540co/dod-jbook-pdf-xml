Specifically, Program Element (PE) 0304260F provides authorized and appropriated funding to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) RDT&E efforts for utilization on airborne platforms.\n \nAccording to the 2018 NDS, we are facing an increasingly complex security environment with adversaries in every operating domain and we need to ensure operations while under persistent multi-domain attack.  The future ISR portfolio will consist of multi-domain, multi-intelligence systems and remain confident across the entire conflict spectrum.  The Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) PE is integral to developing the SIGINT component of the multi-domain, multi-ISR system capable of maintaining the warfighter's decisive advantage through all ranges of military operations, to include the highly contested environments (HCE).\n\nASE Program funds are distributed to projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).  The SCWG is chartered to guide the ASE capability investment.  When required, the USAF may move funds between ASE projects, developing the highest priority projects in response to urgent (e.g., JUON) and emerging (e.g., JEON) warfighter needs.\n\nThe ASE Program participates in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of International and Air Force standards (e.g., North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) standardization) to ensure Joint, Allied, and Coalition interoperability with ASE fielded systems.  ASE funds lead the modernization efforts including existing airborne platform sensors, and where appropriate, their interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS).  Summarizing, the ASE Program approach is a synergistic development effort providing Air Force-wide ISR capabilities consistent with the NDS.  \n\nASE will use the Air Force SIGINT Architecture (AFSA) for planning and decision-making.  AFSA is focused on employing open architecture standards whenever possible, to allow maximum effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility of development upgrades with multi-domain interoperability.  That is, the ASE primary goal is to produce an open system architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF.\n\nFunds in any project may be utilized to cover activities to include studies and analysis activities, supporting both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Through extensive utilization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based solutions to field needed capabilities, it also incurs a need for continuous identification of suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and integration efforts consistent with the COTS technology cycle.  These efforts provide required engineering for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations integrated into the various baseline modifications.  These funds will be disbursed among the RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL programs.  Funding reflects the SCWG priorities and the accomplishment of other Airborne SIGINT Enterprise initiatives."

The Common Development project also supports the development and integration of new sensor capabilities, quick reaction capabilities, and replacement components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).\n  \nDevelopment supports the ASIP system and follow-on SIGINT sensors to include Global High-altitude Open-system Sensor Technology (GHOST).  The ASIP sensor provides a common SIGINT system, allowing for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system.  The GHOST sensor is being developed as a platform agnostic SIGINT sensor to replace ASIP through the use of rapid acquisition strategies, implementation of open architecture concepts, and rapid integration of new signals of interests.  GHOST will be designed to address the NDS and Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan identified needs for multi-ISR systems in order to sustain SIGINT operations in a highly contested environment.\n\nThis project also supports overarching Airborne SIGINT Enterprise Program common development to include, but not limited to, the Air Force SIGINT Architecture maintenance, SIGINT modeling and simulation efforts, and technology development and risk reduction through the Air Force Research Lab managed Open Architecture Technology Lab (OATL).  Capability improvements needed to exploit service identified signals of interest will be identified as priorities by the Air Force SCWG.  This project provides the warfighter increased SIGINT combat capability via rapid acquisition.  Capability enhancements are implemented as soon as the ASE technology achieves satisfactory risk levels.  ASE developed Sensors will be integrated and tested on available platforms, funding permitting.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

This program pursues SIGINT technologies for program transition, to include Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Audio, Analytics, Special Signals of Interest, and Radio Frequency Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT).  The COMPASS BRIGHT program objective is to mature technologies for application in SIGINT and MASINT systems or subsystems. Production and integration of these developed technologies will be conducted by the appropriate programs. COMPASS BRIGHT projects are selected through a data call process, whereby the USAF evaluates proposals from the laboratories, platforms, and other government agencies, to select those projects that are most promising.\n\nOperational Reconnaissance (Ops Recce) is part of the initiative to improve overall USAF intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability through development and use of sensor data from non-traditional ISR platforms and innovative use of sensors.  This program pursues Ops Recce capabilities for transition through development, testing, demonstration and implementation efforts across all platforms.  The Ops Recce program objective is to provide increased battlespace awareness through the use of sensors\/platforms to achieve effects beyond what those sensor\/platforms were originally designed.   \n\nThe program office authority extends to accomplishment of out-of-cycle COMPASS BRIGHT efforts.  These tasks may be filtered through the SIGINT Capability Working Group (SCWG) outside the normal vetting process to expedite acquisition of high-end capabilities for the warfighter.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

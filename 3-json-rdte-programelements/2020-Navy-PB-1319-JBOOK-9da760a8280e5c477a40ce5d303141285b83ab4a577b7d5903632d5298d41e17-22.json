This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions.  Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

            "val": "PE 0203735A Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3rd Quarter (QTR) Fiscal Year (FY) 2011.  \n\nThe Recovery Vehicle Improvement program is a group of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) that will allow the current recovery vehicle to regain Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle as defined in the Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift and Evacuation System (HERCULES) Enhanced M88A2E1 Capability Production Document Increment 2 dated 20 January 2017.  The fielded M88A2 HERCULES lacks the necessary power, weight, and braking ability to safely support the recovery of the M1A2SEPv2 in all situations and with the next generation M1A2SEPv3 weight growth, the problem will get worse. The M88A3 HERCULES vehicles will bring back the operational capability of the single vehicle recovery. The increased winching and lifting capability accommodates all 80 ton Abrams variants. Without this increased capability, units must use two M88A2 Medium Recovery Vehicles to perform the necessary spectrum of recovery operations.  \n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nStryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, Network Lethality, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker FoV. Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 ECP, Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades restores Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and SWaP-C lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD and CROWS-J ONS efforts addressed Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort integrates a 30mm-equipped weapon station providing, USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops, 360 Situational Awareness, and reactive armor tiles. Stryker Fire Direction Center (FDC) Variant will provide an on-the move, protective vehicle that processes voice and digital information in a timely manner while maintaining contact with the indirect fire team over extended distances. Stryker Lethality ECP efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon ECP, CROWS-J ECP, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ECP, common masted sensor ECP, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and address Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and Modified Improved Target Acquisitions System (MITAS) obsolescence issues that will impact fleet sustainment beginning in FY 2020. The ATGM ECP will upgrade the MITAS, incorporate a far target locator and disseminate target acquirement information utilizing network lethality, providing a common operating picture."

The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes M1 Abrams turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles. Currently, the M88A2 is unable to safely perform Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) of the Abrams tank in all conditions, due to added weight\/survivability improvements made to the tank. In order to ensure SVR is met, Project Director- Main Battle Tank Systems (PD-MBTS) will develop and integrate Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) technologies for the M88A2 HERCULES through an Operations and Support (O&S) initiative to meet its operational requirements of SVR throughout its life cycle. This initiative is not intended to exceed current operational capability, but will instead regain SVR capability of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.\n\nAnalyses conducted to date suggests that upgrades to the M88A2 track, suspension, hydraulics, engine, transmission and other related components are required to meet single vehicle recovery for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2021 Base dollars will continue the design, development, integration, prototype build, and continue Government Systems Engineering and Program Management office support. This will include labor, training, travel, supplies, and equipment to effectively manage the program. The prototype vehicles will enter testing in FY 2022 to confirm technical solutions meet performance requirements."

This approach was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3rd Quarter (Q) FY 2011.\n\nThe Abrams vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. In order to restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams. The ECPs will incorporate lost power generation and distribution technologies, lethality improvements, force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection Systems, technologies to mitigate obsolescence issues, in-bound technologies under development technologies to decrease the overall weight of the tank, and technologies in support of any validated Army requirement."

Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades restores Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD and CROWS-J ONS efforts addressed Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the United States Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort integrates a 30mm-equipped weapon station providing, USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancements addresses evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops, 360 Situational Awareness, reactive armor tiles, and integration of emerging and existing technologies such as the Fire Direction Center requirement, Mobile Command, Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), Turreted Mortar, and other Stryker based platform solutions.  The Stryker Fire Direction Center Variant (FDC) variant will provide an on-the move capability that processes voice and digital data while maintaining contact with the indirect fire team over extended distances. Stryker Lethality ECP (30 mm medium caliber weapon, CROWS-J, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM), common masted sensor, and other capabilities) efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).  Additionally, the Lethality MEP upgrades will address existing obsolescence issues of the Remote Weapon Station (RWS) with the CROWS  and CROWS-J upgrade and Modified Improved Target Acquisitions System (MITAS) with the improved sights.  The ATGM ECP will upgrade the MITAS, incorporating a far target locator and disseminate target acquirement information utilizing network lethality, providing a common operating picture.  Upgrade of the Stryker flat-bottom hull and DVH variants to mitigate known system deficiencies.  The identified deficiencies include, but are not limited to the Mobile Gun System (MGS) and Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissnace Vehicle (NBCRV). Efforts for the Stryker Double V-Hull A1 (DVH A1) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) (formerly named Stryker ECP 1), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) (formerly named Stryker ONS Lethality), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, Stryker Lethality ECPs (formerly referred to as Stryker ECP 2) and Stryker Fire Directional Center Variant (FDC)."

In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and DVH variants.  In March 2013, Phase II was approved continuing design and integration of ECP 1 mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades, and the in-vehicle network upgrades.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP 1 efforts on the DVH platform and defer efforts on flat-bottom Strykers.  The effort has subsequently been renamed the Stryker DVH A1 ECP.  The DVH A1 ECP Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The initial DVH A1 ECP production contract was awarded in October 2016 (Sole-Source Firm Fixed Price arrangement).  A second and third buy of DVH A1 ECP vehicles was awarded as a Fixed Price Incentive Fee arrangement.  A March 2018 AROC decision to pure fleet the Stryker brigades to DVH with the initial approval for 6 DVH A1 brigades.  The objective acquisition strategy is to annually procure 1\/2 of a brigade. \n\nOn July 2, 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker 30mm ICVD ONS effort.  30mm ICVD Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contracts for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Logistics Products Development\/Test Support were awarded in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively (Cost Plus Incentive-Fee basis).  The 30mm ICVD ONS Production\/Retrofit contract was awarded in May 2016 through an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).  Definitization of the Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Production contract occurred in March 2017.\n\nThe Stryker Lethality ECP efforts will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package MEP lethality upgrades 30mm medium caliber weapon system, CROWS-J, common masted sensor, ATGM target acquisition optics, integration of emerging and existing technologies such as the Fire Direction Center requirement, Mobile Command, Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), Turreted Mortar, and other Stryker based platform solutions, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's SBCTs. Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approval to initiate the Stryker CROWS-J and ATGM ECP efforts was received in a September 30, 2016 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM). A 30mm medium caliber weapon system (MCWS) decision was made in March 2019.   The 30mm MCWS effort will award design studies to 5 vendors, evaluate the bid samples requested for production award to determine if there is a vehicle that is ready for production.  If the none of the bid samples are production ready, then additional design\/development will be required beginning in FY 2021.  To improve platform survivability fleet wide, 360 Situational Awareness will be developed by integrating existing technologies, for fleet wide installation over a period of six years to allow the occupants during both open and closed hatch operations to visualize their immediate surrounding while stationary and on the move in adverse weather conditions.\n\nIn 2016, the Army approved the FDC requirement and the Field Artillery Battalion TAC using excess Flat Bottom Hull  (FBH) Stryker during Force Design Update (FDU) process.  Following the March 2018 Pure fleet AROC decision, Force Design Division (FDD) identified the Double V Hull A1  (DVH A1) as the platform for the FDC."

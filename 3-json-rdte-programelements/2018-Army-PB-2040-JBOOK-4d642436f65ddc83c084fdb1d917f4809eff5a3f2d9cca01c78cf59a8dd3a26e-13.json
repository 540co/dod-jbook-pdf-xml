            "val": "This Program Element (PE) designs and evaluates, power components and power management technologies, frequency control and timing devices, high power microwave devices, display technologies; and electronic components. The applied research on these technologies enable the ability to perform precision deep fires against critical mobile and fixed targets; investigate all-weather, day or night, theater air defense against advanced enemy missiles and aircraft; as well as investigate enhanced communications and target acquisition through support of capabilities such as autonomous missile systems, advanced land combat vehicles, smart anti-tank munitions, electric weapons, secure jam-resistant communications, automatic target recognition, foliage-penetrating radar, and combat identification. Project EM8 designs and evaluates high-power electronic components and technologies. Project H11 designs, investigates and validates advanced power and energy technologies (batteries, alternative energy and hybrids) and power management and distribution techniques (wireless power, intelligent power management). Project H17 designs and evaluates flexible displays in conjunction with the Flexible Display Center. Project H94 researches and evaluates electronic component technologies such as photonics, micro electromechanical systems, imaging laser radar, magnetic materials, ferroelectrics, microwave and millimeter-wave components, and electromechanical systems. \n\nWork in this PE complements and is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD. and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)\/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power\/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.\n\nThis Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality and Soldier portfolios.\n\nThe work in this Project is coordinated with the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork on this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution.

            "val": "The F-22 Raptor provides air superiority to the Joint Force, access in the highly contested operational environment, as well as homeland and cruise missile defense for the next 40+ years. The F-22 is a multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines low observability, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable air superiority aircraft. The program is continuing planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities. The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, navigations, pilot systems, and electronic warfare.\n\nThe F-22 Raptor's Modernization Development is conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software\/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-22 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The program is continuing planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities. The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, navigations, pilot systems, and electronic warfare.\n\nThe F-22 Raptor's Modernization Development is conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean.

Link 16 capabilities will be enabled by Open System Architecture (OSA) and enables 5th generation F-22 fighter aircraft to transmit tactical information through datalink to the 5th generation F-35 (a.k.a. 5th-to-5th), as well as to 4th generation aircraft (a.k.a. 5th-to-4th). Transmitting tactical data to other aircraft types via datalink is a top Air Force priority. With Link 16 Transmit, the F-22's superior 5th Generation sensor suite will critically support the situational awareness of all participants in the operational environment.  Mode 5 IFF will deliver IFF Transpond and Interrogate capabilities. Mode 5 IFF is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council-mandated Blue Force identification capability that improves Raptor survivability and reduces fratricide risk DoD-wide.  Mode 5 IFF brings significantly enhanced combat identification in both quality and security.  All capabilities will be fielded on the F-22 Block 30\/35 combat coded F-22 fleet.\n\nThe F-22's Link 16 and Mode 5 IFF developments are conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software\/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature."

The F-22 CTF located at Edwards Air Force Base conducts full-up weapons system testing to assess the effect of the F-22 combined characteristics of stealth speed, maneuverability, and integrated avionics upon mission accomplishment. The CTF uses operationally significant ground and flight test scenarios to identify system performance deficiencies of Link 16 and Mode 5 IFF early before they are more difficult and costly to resolve. The F-22 Raptor's Lab and CTF are conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software\/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature."

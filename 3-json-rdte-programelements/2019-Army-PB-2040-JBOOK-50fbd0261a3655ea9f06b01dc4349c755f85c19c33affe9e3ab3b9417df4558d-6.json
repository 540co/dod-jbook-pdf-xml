The prototype will utilize latest off-the shelf technologies and have the capability to upgrade to the Combat Vehicle Prototyping (CVP) technologies as they become available. Acceleration of the contract will require modification of the current contract.\n\nNGCV Cross Functional Team (CFT)\/PM will use the OTA to submit a call for white papers to Industry for concepts that will show technologies that will improve a combat vehicle (IFV or Tank) in the areas of mobility, survivability, lethality, situational awareness, sensor fusion and demonstrate a path to autonomy. The white papers will be used to award 1 to 2 contracts to build a prototype which will be delivered by 1Q FY2021. Information from the prototypes (both organic and from Industry), along with the parallel modeling and simulation will inform the development of the NGCV requirements.\n\nDemonstrate Sensor Fusion\/Crew Station requirements for manned and unmanned systems. Will continue to provide integration support and technology procurement for the software system integration laboratory (SIL). Provide integration support and user evaluation for the crew station SIL. These SILs will allow the integration team to simulate integrated system functionality prior to the actual physical integration of the system. Work performed in these SILs will be critical to the successful mitigation of risk for the integrated systems demonstration by identifying any system integration-related errors as early as possible. Identifying errors early in the integration process will allow the team to develop solutions in a timely and effective manner. Will continue to mature the system level integration of the powerpack (engine, transmission, integrated starter generator, exhaust, air inlet, and thermal management system) along with working new projects in the areas of sensor fusion, which may include, but not limited to, data inputs from Global Positioning System (GPS), Light Detection and Raging (LIDAR), SOund Navigation And Ranging (SONAR), RAdio Detection And Ranging (RADAR), optical Infrared, UltraViolet (UV), etc. Will procure specialty tooling and long-lead items, and will continue to provide software support that is needed for system integration, for the accelerated demonstration."

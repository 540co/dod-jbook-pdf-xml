This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities. The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to, and in conjunction with, the PSE RDT&E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG). As such this program will obtain, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG-funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG-developed PSE.  In support of PSE, this RDT&E program includes spectrum planning for radio frequency (RF), communication security (cyber), information assurance requirements, integration and interoperability command control & communication (3) platform & components.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection Commercial Off The Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control, power, mobility, and defeat effects) which are considered effective for AF physical security use. This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C 3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission. Force Protection programs are inherently subject to rapid changes in the operational environment and will retain sufficient Program flexibility to meet changes in location, scope and capability in order to protect Air Force people, facilities and warfighting assets. Defender Multi-Domain Command, Control and Communications (DMDC3) - The DMDC3 initiative will rapidly develop the foundational structure of IBDSS to provide a platform that integrates the computing power, the means of communication, and the tools for situational awareness.\n\n      \n\nCounter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) is a rapid acquisition and deployment capability existing of full kill (detect, track, assess and defeat with various capabilities (fixed, mobile, portable and hand-held.) It is a layered system-of-systems using COTS technologies, integrated via GOTS C2 system.\n\nCounter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) supports EUCOM JUON to protect specific strategic assets in overseas theaters of operation from the evolution of small unmanned aerial systems based on low cost, extensive proliferation, and availability in the commercial marketplace. FY17 is Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. \n\nCounter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) in support of the Combined Joint Task Force - Operations INHERENT RESOLVE in CENTCOM.  This funding protects assets from the evolution of small UAS systems based on low cost, extensive proliferation and availability in the current market place.\n\nCounter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) protection capabilities at downward selected high priority sites.\n\nCounter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) protection capabilities for 7th Air Force Urgent Operational Need (UON)\n\nCounter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) provides counter-drone full-kill chain capabilities to Air Force installation, while also advancing and exploring existing and new capabilities.\n  \n\nAir Base Ground Defense (ABGD) will support all Development testing, Evaluation, Integration, Certification, and proof of concept for Tactical Automated Security Systems (TASS) and other tactical\/expeditionary equipment that is required to provide robust force protection capabilities worldwide; flight-line security, aircraft, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets, critical infrastructure, sustained sortie generation and air operations, advanced technology force multipliers to include: night vision and thermal imagery equipment, counter sniper\/battery capabilities, ground weapons, target acquisition radar, inter operable tactical communications, [required C3 and protective standoff equipment for] wheeled tactical [non-tactical], armored [un-armored] vehicles, tactical sensors systems, integrated and interoperable command control & communication (3) platform & components, and unit\/personnel protective field equipment. Additionally, ABGD will support all Development testing, Evaluation, Integration, Certification, and proof of concept  for Technology Integration Management (TIM) and associated integration and interoperability efforts.\n\nAirbase Air Defense Systems (ABADS)\nThe Air Force Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft System (C-sUAS) program will be the principal USAF program to defend against the emerging and growing small unmanned aerial system threat.  This program protects strategic assets vital to national security while bedded down and while on the move.  It also protects personnel deployed in theater.  Small UASs are inexpensive and commercially available and have been used to target US Service members, Allies and Coalition partners.  This threat will evolve continuously as commercially available drone technology and drones advance rapidly.  The USAF will be analyzing the evolving threat, and evaluating new capabilities to take on this threat, while also designing an architecture and new systems to bring down life cycle cost so that capability can be fielded to all 180+ AF installations and protect AF assets globally.  \n\nThe Air Force requires Airbase Air Defense Systems (ABADS) RDT&E funding for Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) to continue capability development essential to maintain pace with the evolving threat.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver these weapon system capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Base Physical Security System capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F. \n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $3.3 million for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

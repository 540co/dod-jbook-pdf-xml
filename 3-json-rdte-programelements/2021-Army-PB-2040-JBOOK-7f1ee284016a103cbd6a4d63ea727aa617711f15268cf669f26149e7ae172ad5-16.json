For defensive cyber efforts hardening the Army's tactical network, efforts also investigates and applies robust cyber security technologies and techniques to advance software, algorithms and protocols utilized within tactical networks to protect against nation state level cyber attacks and maintain Warfighter confidence in network information by hardening the blue force attack surface. \n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priorities."

            "val": "This program element (PE) encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for tactical Electronic Warfare (EW). The Integrated Electronic Warfare System (IEWS) is a system of systems capability set that integrates electronic attack, protect and support functions to dramatically improve the ability to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage within the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS).  It is based on a modular, scalable and open architecture to allow Army Brigade Combat Team (BCT) and Joint Force Commander's to tailor capability responses against a variety of EW threats\/scenarios. \n\nThe IEWS capability set is structured along four program lines of effort: 1) Project DX5 Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tools (EWPMT), 2) Project DX6 Multi-Function EW (MFEW), 3) Project VS6 Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) which provides current defensive electronic attack capability, and 4) Project ET7 Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation (RIM) which resolves radio frequency interference and electromagnetic fratricide and enables electronic warfare and communications compatibility.\n\nProject DX5 - EWPMT will provide the Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) planning capabilities to coordinate, manage, and deconflict the use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum and synchronize spectrum operations within the Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) cell. EWPMT will integrate data elements from Mission Command, Intelligence, and Fires to achieve a Common Operating Picture (COP) of the Electromagnetic Operational Environment. \n\nProject DX6 - The Multi-Function EW (MFEW) is a System of Systems that will provide the BCT Commander with an organic airborne and ground offensive Electronic Attack (EA) and Electronic Warfare Support (ES) capability. MFEW-Air and MFEW-Ground variants empower Commanders to shape the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) to their advantage.  MFEW will provide commanders from BCT to CORPS with an organic EW capability that dramatically improves a land force's ability to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage within the EMS in order to execute successful unified land operations. These capabilities give the commander a competitive advantage by denying, degrading the enemy's ability to conduct Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and targeting; and allows the commander to optimize effects within the EMS at the time and place of their choosing. These systems are networked with the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT) to allow remote operation and dynamic tasking\/reprogramming. \n\nProject ET7 \u2013 Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation (RIM) is a cross cutting capability to centrally manage and provide oversight to identify, define, test, and coordinate development of Radio Frequency (RF) interference mitigation material solutions to resolve mutual RF interference and electromagnetic fratricide for Spectrum Dependent Systems (SDS).\n\nProject VS6 - Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) provides for protection for ground forces operating in vehicle convoys, single vehicle operations and fixed locations in all theatres of operations.  It is programmable to migrate with the evolving threat and provides non-lethal capabilities which enable freedom of movement across depth\/breadth of the operational environment.\nFY 2018 budget request funds Electronic Warfare Development."

MFEW-Air and MFEW-Ground variants empower Commanders to shape the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) to their advantage.  MFEW will provide commanders with an organic EW capability that dramatically improves a land force's ability to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage within the EMS in order to execute successful unified land operations. These capabilities give the commander a competitive advantage by denying, degrading the enemy's ability to conduct Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and targeting, and allows the commander to optimize effects within the EMS at the time and place of their choosing. These systems are networked with the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT) to allow remote operation and dynamic tasking\/reprogramming. \n\nMFEW-Air is an airborne payload to be mounted on both manned and unmanned ariel platforms. MFEW-Air is comprised of three variants:  Air Large (Class IV Unmanned Aerial Vehicle),  Air Small (Class III Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), and manned rotary wing payloads.  MFEW-Air will retain the capability to operate independently, but when integrated into a system of systems will provide a layered EW approach that also will include the MFEW-Ground variants.  This will provide extended target frequency range coverage, increased target geo-location precision, increased target standoff range, and increased persistence on target in all weather conditions day or night.\n\nJustification:\nFY2018 Base dollars in the amount of $24.310 million will complete MFEW-Air Large Milestone B (MS B) activities with a MS B Decision and competitive award of an Engineering and Manufacturing Developmental (EMD) contract; and commence MFEW-Ground pre-Milestone B activities."

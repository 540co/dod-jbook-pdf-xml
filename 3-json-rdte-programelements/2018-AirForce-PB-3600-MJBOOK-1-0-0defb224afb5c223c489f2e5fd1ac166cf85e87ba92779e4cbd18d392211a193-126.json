STP missions provide a cost-effective way to flight test new militarily relevant space system technologies, concepts, and designs, providing a way to:  \n \n- Support the acquisition block development approach \n- Demonstrate and develop responsive research and development (R&D) space capabilities \n- Provide early operational capabilities to quickly react to new developments \n- Perform operational risk reduction through direct flight test of prototype components \n- Improve operational design by characterizing the space environment, event, or sensor physics proposed for an operational system\/system upgrade \n- Develop, integrate, test, and acquire advanced payload support hardware for launch vehicles (LV) and human-rated spaceflight vehicles \n \nThe Deputy Secretary of Defense Space Test Program Management & Funding Policy, issued in July 2002, reaffirmed STP as the primary provider of spaceflight for the DoD space research community.  The July 2002 policy statement also reaffirmed STP's role as the single manager for all DoD payloads on the International Space Station (ISS). \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

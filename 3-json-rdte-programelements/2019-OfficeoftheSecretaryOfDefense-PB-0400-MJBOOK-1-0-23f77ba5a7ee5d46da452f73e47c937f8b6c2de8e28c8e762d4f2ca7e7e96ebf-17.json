These efforts include conducting mission informed capability-based analysis; portfolio assessments to include analyzing modernization trends that result in the development of roadmaps or business area strategies that support balanced investment decisions; and monitoring and assessing Major Defense Acquisition Programs(MDAPs) , Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS), and defense Business Systems in a capability portfolio context.  Activities in the JTIDS project are divided into four areas:  (1) mission informed capability-based analysis; (2) Interoperability & Integration; (3) roadmap development and support to business area strategies; and (4) support tools and guidance.  JTIDS also enables cross-department collaboration to enable enterprise-wide approaches. This includes:  (1) vertical and horizontal integration activities within the Department and with the interagency where appropriate; (2) engaging in a coordinated portfolio-based approach to planning,  programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) reform efforts at the legislative, governance, management and execution levels.  JTIDS is focused on capabilities-based portfolio management of the Department's key enablers, thus there are many shared equities with in ASD(A) and across OSD.  To fully meet mission need the JTIDS program supports extensive collaboration with  required alliances and with other OSD PSA's for Communications and Networks, C2, Non-Intel Space  and Business Systems."

The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) funding fulfills the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities, netcentric\/JIE communications which comply to standards for interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems as well as the mission functionality that uses these systems. Also, these funds underwrite assessment of design and procurement and execution correction of critical information systems from initial definition through development to successfully delivered configurations. Funds provide expertise supporting technical oversight of design, performance and cost parameters of key Defense IT and National Security Systems and supporting infrastructure including critical cyber assessments. Resources in this program fund architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3, non-intelligence space, and cyber activities. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, architectures, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation."

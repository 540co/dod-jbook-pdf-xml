Commercial technologies are continuously investigated and leveraged where possible. Project 779 researches and develops MC software, algorithms, protocols, architectures, and devices that enable management of information across the tactical and strategic battle space; provides automated cognitive reasoning and decision making aids; allows timely distribution, presentation\/display and use of MC data on Army platforms; and researches alternatives to Global Positioning System (GPS) for positioning, navigation and timing. Project CY2 investigates cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA), cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber-attacks and new mobile networking protocols that afford resilience within our networks to autonomically 'fight through' and\/or evade hostile cyber effects. Project H92 supports research in communications components, software, algorithms and protocols, which allow field commanders to communicate on-the-move to\/from virtually any location, through a seamless, secure, self-organizing, self-healing network.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology) , PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology), and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology), and is coordinated with PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602120A, (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology), and PE 0602874A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This Project also investigates antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and to reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers, such as radios and jammers. Additionally, this Project investigates defensive cyber, cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber attacks and new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. Beginning in FY19 cyber efforts are being reported in Project CY2. This Project also investigates software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and it designs spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of the congested RF spectrum. This Project also designs new technology and techniques to lower the size, weight, power and cost of networking systems deployed on Army platforms.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

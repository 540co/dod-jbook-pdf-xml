This program element funds government civilian salaries and benefits, travel, contract support services, and operations of non-fielded activities.\n\nManagement Headquarters Activities provide executive leadership planning, develop centralized agency policy, prepare and defend annual budget submissions, respond to external inquiries, and implement SECDEF and Presidential priorities.  As a DoD research, development and acquisition agency, the Headquarters Activities provide cost efficient oversight, direction, and control of initiatives and processes that assure best value, high quality, on-time, and successful performance of MDA acquisition programs.  This is accomplished by ensuring acquisition and procurement program management emphasizes systems engineering; incorporates  life cycle management objectives; implements risk management; and assesses cost, schedule or performance trade-offs."

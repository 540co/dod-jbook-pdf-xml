Project K70 pursues technologies that improve the Soldier's ability to see at night and to provide rapid wide area search. It also demonstrates technologies that provide the ability to perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), to integrate disparate sensor architectures, and to enable passive long range target identification (ID). Project K86 matures and evaluates sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment and deception from airborne platforms. It provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots\/crew members independently for enhanced operations in day\/night\/adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).   \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)\/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA."

            "val": "Project DX8.  The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nJustification:\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $3.929 million for project DX8 supports HIMARS-unique Software Build, Version 8.2.  This software is projected to be available for fielding to the M142 fleet in FY2019.  Software Version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade.\n\nProject 093.  The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers. This project funds software development for the MLRS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nJustification:\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $5.000 million for project 093 supports the initiation of software development of an organic tactical software build in support of the interim Fire Control System (FCS) hardware supporting both the current MLRS Fleet (upon upgrade with a modern hardware FCS) and the Army\u2019s MLRS Fleet Expansion effort.  This software development leverages the program\u2019s completed software transition from the prime contractor to the government in FY2016.  This interim FCS solution will be ready to field in FY2021 and the long-term FCS solution is expected to be ready to field in FY2024.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and anticipated to be the first release of organic software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher in FY2021.\n\nProject DZ8:  Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack\/neutralize\/suppress\/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24\/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly\/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 300km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was directed in the Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013. The AoA was completed on 30 April 2015 and a letter of sufficiency issued by OSD in September 2015. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) is scheduled for 06 January 2017."

The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $3.929 million for project DX8 supports HIMARS-unique Software Build, Version 8.2.  This software is projected to be available for fielding to the M142 fleet in FY2019.  In addition to addressing software maintenance, Software Version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade."

Communication suite changes, munitions updates, and introduction of new munitions require software and\/or hardware updates to ensure full compatibility.\n\nThe enduring organic v8.x software effort is projected for Materiel Release and fielding to HIMARS fleet in FY17.  Version 8.0 will be the initial roll-out.  Version 8.1 will follow in FY18. Version 8.2 will follow in FY19.

LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24\/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly\/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017.\n\nThe Army initially funded the development of the LRPF under PE 0603778A, Proj DZ8.

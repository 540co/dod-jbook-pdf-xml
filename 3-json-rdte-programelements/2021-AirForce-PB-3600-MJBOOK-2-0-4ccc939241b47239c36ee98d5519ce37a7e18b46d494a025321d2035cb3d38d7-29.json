            "val": "A refresh of the F-15C\/D fleet is critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Older F-15C\/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th-generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C\/Ds are beyond their service life and have serious structural risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C\/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure. \n\nFunds may be used to manufacture aircraft, support equipment, and initial spares to support test activities; integrate hardware and software subsystems; upgrade training systems and systems integration labs; develop training materials and technical manuals; pursue other non-recurring engineering activities to reduce integration risks, ramp up the production line capacity, prepare for flight testing, and investigate technology insertion opportunities; resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources\/ Material Shortages (DMSMS) and\/or obsolescence issues; fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness; and cover other related requirements to manufacture and sustain the test aircraft. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Older F-15C\/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th-generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C\/Ds are beyond their service life and have serious structural risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time-consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C\/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure.\n\nFunds may be used to manufacture aircraft, support equipment, and initial spares to support test activities; integrate hardware and software subsystems; upgrade training systems and systems integration labs; develop training materials and technical manuals; pursue other non-recurring engineering activities to reduce integration risks, ramp up the production line capacity, prepare for flight testing, and investigate technology insertion opportunities; resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources\/Material Shortages (DMSMS) and\/or obsolescence issues; fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness; and cover other related requirements to manufacture and sustain the test aircraft.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

To rapidly field the F-15EX, the USAF plans to focus engineering activities on integrating existing systems and ramping up the production line capacity. Test activities will likewise be tailored to focus on integration of F-15QA, EPAWSS, and the Suite 9.1 OFP, taking appropriate credit for previous USAF and FMS testing. Finally, logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure."

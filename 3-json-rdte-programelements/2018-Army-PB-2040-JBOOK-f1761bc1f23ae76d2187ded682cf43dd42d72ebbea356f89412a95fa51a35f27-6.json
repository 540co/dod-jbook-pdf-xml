            "val": "Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 budget request funds Infantry Support Weapons.  This Program Element (PE) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) manages the Soldier as a system, with the goal of increasing Soldiers' combat effectiveness, increasing survivability, and improving the Soldiers' quality of life.  It develops and tests prototypes of weapons, clothing, equipment, and other items useful to support the Soldier.  \n\nProject ES9 (Advanced Tactical Parachute System) supports efforts to improve Static Line (SL) and Military Free Fall (MFF) personnel parachutes and associated equipment to include canopy improvements based on integration of new technology with the goal of enhancing the insertion capability of the airborne soldier and increasing the performance, safety and durability of personnel airdrop equipment.\n\nProject EW4 (Crew Served Weapons Engineering) supports efforts to transition components or prototypes from Small Arms Improvement, Project S54, Program Element 0603827A, (Budget Activity 4) and other domestic and foreign sources of small arms weapons to demonstrate, test and evaluate capability near or at planned operational requirements.\n\nProject FF2 (Small Arms Fire Control (SAFC)) supports optimized fire control devices to support Squad (S), Crew Served (CS) and Precision (P).  SAFC shall increase the probability of hit and decrease time to engage across a range of small arms weapon systems, with a direct-view optic that allows for quicker and more accurate target detection and recognition.  \n\nProject FI2 (Lightweight 30mm Cannon) provides increased lethality modification to the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), it serves as the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) light reconnaissance vehicle, an upgraded medium caliber weapon will be developed, tested and evaluated for integration into a modified remote weapon station.\n\nProject S58 (Soldier Enhancement Program) supports accelerated integration, modernization, and enhancement efforts of lighter, more lethal weapons, and improved Soldier items including lighter, more comfortable load-bearing equipment, field gear, survivability items, communications equipment, and navigational aids. \n\nProject S60 (Clothing and Equipment) supports pre-production development of state-of-the-art individual clothing and equipment to improve the survivability, mobility and sustainment affecting the quality of life of the individual Soldier.\n\nProject S61 (Aircrew Integrated Systems) provides System Development programs with improved aviator safety, survivability, and human performance that amplify the warfighting effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of the Army aircraft including the AH-64 Apache\/Longbow, CH-47 Chinook, UH\/HH-60 Blackhawk, Light Utility Helicopter, and Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter.\n\nProject S62 (Counter-Defilade Target Engagement) the XM25, Individual Airburst Weapon System (IAWS) delivers a 25mm programmable high explosive airburst (HEAB) round to defeat defilade and point area targets out to approximately 600 meters. Accurate and lethal engagement of defilade targets at the squad level is the number one capability gap identified by the United States Army Infantry Center (USAIC).\n\nProject S63 (Small Arms Improvements) demonstrates engineering development models or integrated commercial items designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition, fire control, training effectiveness, and reliability for small arms weapon systems and ammunition.  Programs include Improved Weapons Coatings, Personal Defense Weapon, 30 Round 5.56mm Magazine, Modular Handgun System (MHS), Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR), Sub Compact, and Interim Combat Service Rifle (ICR). \n\nProject S64 (CROWS) continues enhancing CROWS capability and reliability to increase its application across combat and tactical platforms.  This capability enhances the Soldier's survivability, lethality and situational awareness.\n\nProject S70 (Personnel Recovery Support System) provides system research, development and testing of the Personal Recovery Support System\/Personnel Recovery Support Equipment supporting operations to report and locate isolated, missing, detained or captured Soldiers.\n\nProject VS5 (Soldier Protective Equipment) supports engineering and manufacturing development of Individual Soldier Ballistic Protection equipment.  It will leverage advancements in technology to continue incremental improvements to body armor (to include improved outer tactical vests, plate carriers, and helmets) and other personal protective equipment."

The SAFC shall utilize an open system of systems architecture comprised of modular components, to deliver current ground forces the initial increased core capability followed by increasing increments of capability over time as technology matures.  Small Arms Fire Control will culminate in three configurations: a Small Arms Fire Control - Squad (SAFC-S), Small Arms Fire Control - Crew Served (SAFC-CS), and Small Arms Fire Control - Precision (SAFC-P).  They may include technology such as variable magnification direct view (day) optics, atmospheric sensors, an overlaid digital display, weapon orientation sensor, range determination, ballistic computer, disturbed reticle, and networked lethality.  There are also other associated fire control efforts being worked simultaneously to include Advanced Individual Handheld Binocular (AIHB), Advanced Fire Control with Precision Projectile Tracking, and Small Arms Fire Control for 40mm Low Velocity.\n\nFY2018 RDT&E funding in the amount of $20.117 million will award a contract and provide for Government and contractor support to initiate the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phases for the two (2) Fire Control configurations ( SAFC-CS and SAFC-P).  For all variants, FY2018 funding will be focused on contract award, initial design\/early prototyping and bid sample testing.

The XM914 is a link fed, externally powered and electrically primed 30mm chain gun, capable of firing two hundred rounds per minute.  The gun incorporates an anti-hangfire system and an extended barrel for enhanced muzzle velocity.  The XM914 provides significant lethality improvements over the current M2 .50 caliber machine gun and MK19 grenade machine gun and provides the capability required for Soldiers in a combat environment to engage enemy personnel and light armored targets."

SEP provides an enduring process that includes procurement and evaluation of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)\/Non-Developmental Item (NDI)\/Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) items that have the potential to enhance Army Infantryman's and Soldiers\u2019 ability to execute their combat mission.  In contrast to the traditional acquisition cycle, SEP provides significant savings and acceleration of testing and evaluation of items.  The SEP program is managed jointly by Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier and the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE).  SEP suggestions are submitted by individual Soldiers, Field Commanders, commercial manufacturers, and others via the PEO Soldier SEP website.  Viable suggestions are vetted by a Council of Colonels (CoC) and validated as SEP initiatives by Director, Capabilities, Integration, Prioritization and Analysis (DAMO-CI).  Validated SEP initiatives are procured in limited quantities for evaluation and testing of feasibility and suitability.  Based on the evaluation findings, the SEP CoC provides one or more of the following courses of action:  (1) no further action, (2) item did not meet objectives, (3) inform deliberate or urgent\/emergent requirements generation, (4) initiate a new Program of Record (POR), (5) improve an existing POR, (6) transition to the Rapid Equipping Force (REF), or (7) add to the Rapid Fielding Initiative (RFI) list.\n\nJustification:  FY18 RDT&E funding supports SEP evaluations and documentation of results."

The Air SS Capability Development Document (CDD) addresses capability gaps identified during sustained combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including inadequate crew station compatibility caused by equipment bulk, aircraft mishaps as a result of limited Situational Awareness (SA), and lack of functionally integrated aircrew mission and survival equipment. Air SS delivers reduced bulk and weight of survival equipment; improved crew station compatibility; and improved pilot SA and safety.  The Air SS provides enhanced terrain, threat, and obstacle avoidance information; improved heads-up display (HUD) technologies that increase the aviator's ability to safely operate in Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) using Three Dimensional conformal symbology; a Helmet Display and Tracking System (HDTS); the capability to perform extended missions in extreme environmental and chemical\/biological threat conditions; the capability to digitally replace paper-based DoD Flight Information Publications (Electronic Flight Bag); and develops and tests a modernized replacement for the Air Warrior survival vest that integrates with Soldier Protection System body armor (Aircrew Combat Ensemble). This project also funds the development and test of deferred CDD capabilities including improved laser eye protection and tactile cueing that enhances aviator SA in a DVE. This program does not duplicate any aircraft platform program efforts.  Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers."

The number one materiel solution to mitigate the critical capability gap (defeating defilade (hidden) targets from 35-500m) is the XM25.  The XM25 provides the Infantry Soldier with a leap-ahead overmatch capability that dramatically increases lethality, range, and capability through the use of a family of programmable 25mm ammunition and allows the Soldier to engage defilade targets with a high degree of accuracy while posing minimal burden, in terms of weight and size.  The XM25 fires 25mm munitions including high-explosive airburst (HEAB) and training rounds.  The XM25 comes with a target acquisition\/fire control subsystem that integrates thermal capability with direct-view optics, laser rangefinder, environmental sensors, fuze setter, ballistic computer, and internal display.  The XM25 has a 500-meter point target range and a 800-meter area target range capable of defeating defilade targets."

Development will also begin on integration of additional effectors, such as the Stinger surface-to-air missile, to increase system lethality against ground and aerial targets.\n\nBeginning in FY2018, $22.500 million will purchase prototypes of an improved and modified remotely operated weapon station for system and component level development, testing and qualification, to include mechanical and software integration with a 30mm autocannon and integration of Stinger surface-to-air missile.\n\nThe Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE) at FT Leonard Wood, MO (user community) has identified continued development of the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) as a critical improvement for the Soldier in a combat environment. By addressing the capability gap of non-turreted, lightly armored vehicles where the gunner is exposed to enemy fire, the current CROWS system provides the ability to rapidly and accurately locate and engage the enemy while allowing platform gunners to remain under armor, thereby providing greater protection and increasing overall lethality. \n\nNext generation requirements for the CROWS are identified in the CROWS Increment II Capability Development Document (CDD).   CROWS Increment II capability improvements will bolster overall situational awareness, survivability and lethality. Increment II requirements include improved sensor systems for enhanced identification ranges; wider fields of view; improved on-the-move accuracy; training capability; battlefield obscurants; mission data recording for After Action Reviews (AAR); increased lethality using legacy and future anti-personnel and anti-materiel precision scalable lethal and non-lethal weapon systems; improved ballistics protection; adaptability to integrate on a variety of legacy and future platforms including ground vehicles, watercraft, semi-autonomous and autonomous platforms; precision targeting including visible and infrared (IR) pointers; target hand-off; slew-to-cue; escalation of force (EOF) capabilities; and other additional system modifications and improvements.\n\nObsolescence and Increment II requirements will address recommendations identified in the Operational Test Agency Milestone Assessment Report (OMAR) and user community feedback. These modifications include, but are not limited to: improved optics survivability; auto-zoom; improved auto-tracking; improved sensors for increased situational awareness; and improved rounds counter. Additionally, development efforts will include system and component level reliability improvements that will extend system life and reduce overall CROWS logistics footprint."

The first increment will be part of an Urgent Materiel Release and will modify the legacy M153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) in order to integrate the XM914 30mm autocannon.  The second increment will require further design and development changes, upgrade the optics on the remote weapon station in order to increase the target identification range of the station to match the capability of the weapon, and incorporate a coaxial machine gun as a secondary weapon system.\n\nThe integration of additional effectors, such as the Stinger surface-to-air missile system, will leverage prior efforts to integrate the Javelin missile on the remote weapon station.\n\nThe legacy Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) used a single-step acquisition approach in its strategy. The CROWS achieved Type Classification Standard in 3QFY2011, Full Materiel Release in 3QFY2012 and Full Rate Production in 4QFY2012, in accordance with the Capability Production Document (CPD) Increment I, as clarified in June 2009. Capability Development Document Increment II was approved in October 2015 addressing requirements for the next generation of CROWS.\n\nThe program objective is to continue developing, improving and fielding the current generation (Increment I) and next generation (Increment II) of CROWS on various platforms in accordance with the Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP). The program supports new and emerging urgent requirements like the integration of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles, ground combat systems, Joint Lightweight Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) and fixed site mounting systems to support Integrated Base Defense (IBD)."

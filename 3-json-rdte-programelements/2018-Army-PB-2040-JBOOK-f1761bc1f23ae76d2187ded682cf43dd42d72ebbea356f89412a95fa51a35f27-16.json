            "val": "Program Element funds development of Non-System Training Devices to support force-on-force training at the Combat Training Centers (CTC), general military training, and training on more than one item\/system, as compared with system devices which are developed in support of a specific item\/weapon system.  Army training devices and training simulations contribute to the modernization of the forces by enabling readiness and strengthening combat effectiveness through realistic training solutions for the Warfighter.  Training devices maximize the transfer of knowledge, skills, and experience from the training situation to a combat situation.  Force-on-force training at the National Training Center (NTC), Ft. Irwin, CA; Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Ft. Polk, LA, and Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC), formerly the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC), Hohenfels, Germany; and battle staff training in Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) provide increased combat readiness through realistic collective training in low, mid, and high intensity scenarios.  Project 241, Non-System Training Devices-Combined Arms, develops simulation training devices for Army-wide use, including the CTCs.  Project 573 funds key organizational support to Army\/DoD Transformation via innovative simulation and training device efforts.  Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (STRI's) unique geographic co-location with other services facilitates joint training solutions in a common environment.  \n \nFY 2018 Project 241 funds significant development efforts in support of U.S. Army Training and Readiness on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES), Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), Target Modernization, Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), OPFOR Integrated Air Defense System (IADS), Soldier Virtual Trainer Program (SVT) New Start, Digital Range Training System (DRTS) New Start, and Soldier Fitness and Suicide Prevention.\n\nFY 2018 Project 573 is the first year that realigns Government authorizations and associated funding to an Army Management Headquarter Account (AMHA), which zeroed out the funding in FY 2018. This was done in accordance with a Program Decision Memorandum."

                            "val": "The Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA) program is the foundation architecture of the Live Training Transformation Family of Training Systems (LT2-FTS). The program contains critical core product-line architecture which provides commonality across training instrumentation systems and interoperability across Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE) and joint training systems. CTIA includes Army owned software components, architecture services, standards, protocols and governance used by domain-specific Live Training Transformation (LT2) and Live Training Systems (LTS) to include instrumented Force-On-Force (FOF) and Force-On-Target (FOT) training requirements. The CTIA also provides Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) and technology refresh for the LT2 family of LTS supporting over 22 live instrumented training products which are fielded at over 200 CONUS and OCONUS sites across the Army.\n\nCombat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) funds the continued development of the existing Instrumentation Systems (IS) at the National Training Center (NTC), Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) and Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC). CTC-IS funds the continued development of the Range Communication System at the NTC and JRTC, to provide high-fidelity live, virtual, and constructive brigade training rotations which prepare Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint partners, and supporting units to deploy in support of the Army Sustainable Readiness Model (SRM).  The CTCs primary goal is to develop agile and adaptive leaders at the tactical, operational and strategic levels while providing BCTs the core training necessary to conduct decisive action in a dynamic operating environment.  \n\nThe Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) program provides realistic, real-time casualty effects for force-on-force tactical engagement training scenarios and its ability to integrate into training instrumentation systems provide for high fidelity combined arms combat exercises supporting the 39th Chief of the Staff of the Army #1 priority of \"Readiness\".  Due to their modular design, I-MILES is required for use at the Home Station, the Combat Training Centers (CTCs) and in theater of operations to meet force-on-force training requirements.  I-MILES program funding provides the Development and Integration of new vehicle and dismount weapon systems meeting the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirements, as well as embedded Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES) development.  This includes new development efforts of the Live Training Engagement Composition (LTEC), increasing simulation of Probability of Kill (Pk) for training realism and improving integration on new weapon platforms (i.e. Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), M4A2 Plus Rifle and Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) with 30mm Gun).\n\nThe Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) provides a high-fidelity deployable instrumented training capability to support platoon thru battalion level Live Force-on-Force Training. HITS tracks location of soldiers and vehicles and simulates weapons' effects and engagements, allowing units to \"Train as they Fight\" against live opponents. HITS provides accurate feedback to training units. HITS consists of light deployable components that can be rapidly assembled\/disassembled and transported to support deployed training. HITS integrates with future and legacy MILES. HITS is a member of the Live Training Transformation (LT2) family of training systems and shares several hardware and software components with the Instrumentation Systems (IS). HITS provides the Live domain for Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) training integration.\n\nThe Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) provides realistic medical training to both medical and non-medical Soldiers in the Active, Reserve, and National Guard. MSTCs provide hands-on instruction on the latest battlefield trauma and critical care techniques based on Army Medical Department (AMEDD) approved performance oriented Program of Instruction (POI). Medical treatment validation exercises simulate the high stress of performing medical interventions in combat. MSTC supports Unit Medical Readiness by validating Combat Medic (68W) Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) biennial recertification requirements and provides Combat Lifesaver (CLS) training to non-medical Soldiers.\n\nThe Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is the unit\/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot\/don't shoot), which includes escalation of force\/graduated response scenarios.\n\nThe Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) family of systems is a lightweight, rapidly deployable, observed fire training system that provides simulated battlefield training for Fire Support Specialists (FSS), Joint Fires Observers (JFO), and Soldiers. The system provides simulated battlefield training to conduct Indirect Fires, Close Air Support, Close Combat Attack, and Naval Surface Fire Support. The CFFT Immersive System provides the capability for Army, Joint, Multinational and Special Operations Forces to conduct advanced, complex and realistic fires training at the FIRES Center of Excellence, Ft Sill, OK. CFFT is a critical training enabler to support Warfighters in applying precision fires on target to prevent fratricide and minimize collateral damage.\n\nThe Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) provides a net-centric linkage that collects, retrieves and exchanges data among LVC Training Aids, Devices, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS) (to include: AVCATT, CCTT, GFT, HITS, JLCCTC and SE Core) and Mission Command Systems. The LVC-IA defines \"how\" information is exchanged among the different LVC domains and the Mission Command Systems.  The LVC-IA provides enterprise level tools for exercise control, after action review, and system information assurance. It develops hardware and software to interface the different Live, Virtual, Constructive and Gaming communication protocols and to provide a correlated common operating picture for the training audience on their organic Mission Command equipment.  The integration of the LVC TADSS with the Mission Command equipment will enable larger and more robust training events, to better prepare U.S. Soldiers for their missions at an overall reduced cost.  The end-state goal is to enable an LVC Integrated Training Environment that can replicate Operational Environments in a cost effective manner to provide a high level of value-added training and mission rehearsal opportunities to Army Commanders and their Soldiers.  In FY17, program will continue Version 3 development activities; FY18 request will commence Version 3 testing and validation, concurrency with mission command systems and initiate Version 4 development activities.\n\nThe Target Modernization program provides a common open architectural framework, standards, specifications, and interfaces for live fire target devices, a common target control system for all range types, and innovative technologies to enhance training realism and reduce life cycle costs on the ranges. The Target Modernization primary goal is the development of trackless target systems, high fidelity dynamic infrared representations, non-contact ballistic hit detections, and augmented reality on live fire ranges; increasing training realism and lowering life cycle costs.\n\nThe Army identified an operational gap in the training strategy for the OPFOR Integrated Air Defense System (IADS). It's a collection of enemy weapons systems that engage Army aviation assets. Training Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Stimulation Suite (TASS) is a live training system consisting of aircraft components and ground emitters that replicate current and emerging enemy Air Defense systems. Its fidelity supports individual pilot training as well as the collective training requirements of the Brigade Combat Team to fully plan, prepare, execute and react against an enemy air defense weapons at the Combat\nTraining Centers (CTC).\n\nThe Digital Range Training System (DRTS) provides new and modern ranges capable of training, evaluating and stressing Soldiers and their modern equipment with a realistic train-as-you-fight environment. Four standard training ranges Digital Multi-Purpose Range Complex (DMPRC), Digital Multi-Purpose Training Range (DMPTR), Battle Area Complex (BAX) and Digital Air Ground Integrated Range (DAGIR) will utilize all available combat systems capabilities, and digitally integrate them to manage all forces undergoing individual and collective live-fire training and qualification. These Training Systems replace obsolete, inadequate training methods and equipment in order to simulate new weapon systems, challenge Soldiers, incorporate the Digitized Force, and provide enhanced training data collection and After Action Review (AAR) capabilities. They incorporate digital system training as well as integrate multiple ranges and training environments for the training units.\n\nThe Army identified a requirement for a Soldier Virtual Trainer (SVT) to replace the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) II and Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) III. The SVT Program (new start) will enable Army Readiness through dismounted collective maneuver capability; will provide individual and crew-served weapons skill development, and will enable Joint fires training, and will exercise Use of Force decision making.\n\nComprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness (CSF2) is research and development efforts that include Future Soldier Assessment Tool (DASH-R) Project, Global Assessment Tool (GAT) 3.0 Project, and Program Evaluation (PE) Project.\n\nFY 2018 Project 241 funds significant development efforts in support of U.S. Army Training and Readiness on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES), Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), Target Modernization, Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), OPFOR Integrated Air Defense System (IADS), Soldier Virtual Trainer Program (SVT) New Start, Digital Range Training System (DRTS) New Start, and Soldier Fitness and Suicide Prevention."

In addition, funding will be used to develop a prototype Integrated Player Unit (IPU) for the DRTS system that combines the multiple boxes used today into one unit, makes the IPU more rugged to withstand the operational environment, and makes the system easier and faster to install. This will make the DRTS more usable by the training units and easier to support. This is the first year of RDTE for the DRTS program."

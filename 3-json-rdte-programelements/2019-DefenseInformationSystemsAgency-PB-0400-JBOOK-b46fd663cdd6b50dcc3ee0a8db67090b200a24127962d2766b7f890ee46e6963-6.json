Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.\n\nThe DoDIN Systems Engineering and Support project performs discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technologies through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to fill capability shortfalls and technology gaps across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).   The OCTO identifies these gaps\/shortfalls, pursues leading innovative solutions from industry, academia, and the Federal sector, and engages industry partners for commercial best practices.  The OCTO Develops technology forecasts and innovation roadmaps for existing and nascent DISA Programs in the following areas:  Process\/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, Communication (DoDIN\/Mobile\/End-User Devices).   The OCTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight of DISA and DoD enterprise products and services.  The OCTO performs early identification of technology needs and explores, develops, and delivers recommended emerging technologies to the DISA Requirements & Analysis Office."

Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD\/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). FFRDCs are also considered depending upon the task."

The Watchlist identifies key technology areas that are essential for Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) including:  Process\/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, and Communication (DoDIN, Mobile\/End-User Devices).   \nThe DODIN Systems Engineering and Support Project ensure the technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) are in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and the latest Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO) Capabilities Planning Guidance (CPG) through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These strategies will establish the foundation for DISA's technology investments and technical development. The OCTO leverages emerging technology to drive efficiencies and cost savings to the DoD, the Warfighter, and other Federal Agencies, and provides actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.\nCyber security and cloud computing present critical near term challenges, especially the ability to securely leverage commercial cloud service offerings. The OCTO\u2019s partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions. Included are applications with a security wrapper that detect and mitigate cyberattacks; smart routing and managed reputation capability; embedded system defense capabilities; and resilient and intrusion-tolerant network capabilities.\nPartnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services. The OCTO will conduct technology assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DODIN architecture and standards. Enabled by the Technology Assessment Framework (TAF) and the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR), the OCTO will perform \u201cquick looks\u201d and deeper technology evaluations to provide critical awareness, characterization, and suitability of specific technologies.

Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.

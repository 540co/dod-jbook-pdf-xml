            "val": "Note:  This budget prioritizes system wholeness to ensure program of record capabilities are fully integrated and support fleet requirements.  System wholeness supports completion of MQ-8C operational test requirements, development of radar, and component redesign required to maintain system hardware.\n\nThe MQ-8 Unmanned Air System is a Joint Military Intelligence Program.\n\nThe MQ-8 Unmanned Air System is popularly known as \"Fire Scout\".  The program achieved MS C in June 2017.  The program includes MQ-8B air vehicles, MQ-8C air vehicles, and associated Mission Control Systems (MCS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Common Automatic Recovery Systems (UCARS) and support equipment.  In addition to the air vehicles, Radar and Weapons capabilities were developed under the Navy's Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC) authorities.  All acquisition actions previously planned under the RDCs have transitioned into the POR.  Current analysis has determined that a total procurement of 63 air vehicles (54 procurement and 9 RDT&EN \/ 30 MQ-8Bs and 33 MQ-8Cs) will satisfy current and foreseeable operational needs. \n \nThe MQ-8 System provides real-time and non-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data to tactical users without the use of manned aircraft or reliance on limited joint theater or national assets. The baseline MQ-8 can accomplish missions including over-the-horizon tactical reconnaissance, classification, targeting and laser designation and battle damage assessment (including voice communications relay).  Development efforts respond to emerging fleet requirements through integration and improvements to Common Operational Picture capabilities, avionics, payloads, range, endurance, and targeting. \n \nThe MQ-8 launches and recovers vertically, and can operate from suitably-equipped air capable ships, as well as confined area land bases.  Interoperability is achieved through the use of the Tactical Control System (TCS) software in the MCS, also referred to as a Ground Control Station (GCS), and through the use of the Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL).  The data from the MQ-8 is provided through standard DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers and ISR (C4ISR) system architectures and protocols.\n\nA deployed MQ-8 system includes air vehicle(s), payloads (i.e. electro-optical\/infrared\/laser designator-range finder, Automated Identification System, voice communications relay, Radar, Weapons, and other specialty payloads), MCS (with TCS and TCDL integrated for interoperability), a UCARS for automatic launch and recovery, and associated spares and support equipment. The schedules for MCS and UCARS components are based on host ship requirements, while schedules for air vehicle components, support equipment, and training equipment are based on operational deployment plans.  A limited number of land-based mission control systems supplement the shipboard systems to support shore-based operations, such as pre-deployment or acceptance functional check flights. These land-based mission control stations will also support depot-level maintenance\/post-maintenance activities.  The MQ-8C provides additional mission endurance and payload-weight-power, increased reliability, and improved maintainability to the MQ-8 Fire Scout System.  MQ-8 systems will support missions on Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Expeditionary Mobile Base (T-ESB), FFG(X), and\/or suitably-equipped air capable ships.  Quantities of air vehicles are derived from LCS and\/or suitably-equipped air capable ship deployment requirements for Surface Warfare and Mine Countermeasures mission sets.\n\nThe MQ-8 Radar capability is the initial effort as part of the Surface Warfare (SUW) Increment of the MQ-8C.  A non-developmental maritime Radar has been competitively selected for integration into the MQ-8C Fire Scout System.  This system will provide the MQ-8 operators and the supported LCS crew enhanced situational awareness of the Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) by providing multiple operational modes to include surface search, track, Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) maritime target classification, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) target classification capabilities.  The maritime Radar will be fully integrated with the Mission Control Systems (MCS) and ship's combat systems providing data in standardized format for ease of dissemination to other users."

Remaining FYDP funding supports completion of Radar development, MQ-8C and Radar test requirements, and continued weapons studies.  Radar and weapons funding supports requirements outlined in the MQ-8C Capabilities Production Document (CPD).  Test funding supports DT and OT events to meet IOC, and deployment dates.  Future payload efforts will be considered when developing current efforts.\n \nSchedule: \t\nUpdated Milestone C decision and other milestones to align to the restructured MQ-8 program.\nUpdated Radar capability contract awards, payloads efforts, and reviews to align to the restructured MQ-8 program.      \nUpdated production and delivery schedules for the current production plan."

FY16 analysis has determined that a total fleet requirement of 60 air vehicles (51 procurement and 9 RDT&EN \/ 30 MQ-8Bs and 30 MQ-8Cs) will satisfy current Fleet needs. \n \nThe MQ-8 System provides real-time and non-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data to tactical users without the use of manned aircraft or reliance on limited joint theater or national assets. The baseline MQ-8 can accomplish missions including over-the-horizon tactical reconnaissance, classification, targeting and laser designation and battle damage assessment (including voice communications relay).  Development efforts respond to emerging fleet requirements through integration and improvements to Common Operational Picture capabilities, avionics, payloads, range, endurance, and targeting. \n \nThe MQ-8 launches and recovers vertically, and can operate from suitably-equipped air capable ships, as well as confined area land bases.  Interoperability is achieved through the use of the Tactical Control System (TCS) software in the MCS, also referred to as a Ground Control Station (GCS), and through the use of the Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL).  The data from the MQ-8 is provided through standard DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers and ISR (C4ISR) system architectures and protocols.\n\nA deployed MQ-8 system includes air vehicle(s), payloads (i.e. electro-optical\/infrared\/laser designator-range finder, Automated Identification System, voice communications relay, Radar, Weapons, and other specialty payloads), MCS (with TCS and TCDL integrated for interoperability), a UCARS for automatic launch and recovery, and associated spares and support equipment. The schedules for MCS and UCARS components are based on host ship requirements, while schedules for air vehicle components, support equipment, and training equipment are based on operational deployment plans.  A limited number of land-based mission control systems supplement the shipboard systems to support shore-based operations, such as pre-deployment or acceptance functional check flights. These land-based mission control stations will also support depot-level maintenance\/post-maintenance activities.  The MQ-8C provides additional mission endurance and payload-weight-power, increased reliability, and improved maintainability to the MQ-8 Fire Scout System.  MQ-8 systems will support missions on Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Expeditionary Mobile Base (T-ESB), FFG(X), and\/or suitably-equipped air capable ships.  Quantities of air vehicles are derived from LCS and\/or suitably-equipped air capable ship deployment requirements for Surface Warfare and Mine Countermeasures mission sets.\n\nThe MQ-8 Radar capability is the initial effort as part of the Surface Warfare (SUW) Increment of the MQ-8C.  A non-developmental maritime Radar has been competitively selected for integration into the MQ-8C Fire Scout System.  This system will provide the MQ-8 operators and the supported LCS crew enhanced situational awareness of the Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) by providing multiple operational modes to include surface search, track, Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) maritime target classification, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) target classification capabilities.  The maritime Radar will be fully integrated with the Mission Control Systems (MCS) and ship's combat systems providing data in standardized format for ease of dissemination to other users."

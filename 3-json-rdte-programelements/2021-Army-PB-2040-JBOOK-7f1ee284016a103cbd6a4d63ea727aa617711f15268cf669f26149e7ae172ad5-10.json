The research will generate soldier-informed data, reports, and analysis to support operational use in future vehicles through soldier experimentation and assessment of technical concepts in simulation and in-field WMIs. The capabilities created by this research will lead to increased overall crew and team performance; improved soldier safety due to fewer soldier per vehicle, closed-hatch operations, and improved standoff from effective control; and vehicles that can effectively perform across multiple domains of battle.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Efforts develop capabilities for NGCV and other autonomous agents that increase autonomy, unburdening the soldier operator, with a high degree of survivability and lethality in a highly contested environment. This work also investigates power distribution and conversion technologies to provide compact, efficient, and high power capabilities for electrical and electro-mechanical loads supporting both mobile and stationary unmanned platforms. Research enables combat vehicles to rapidly learn, adapt, and reason faster than the adversary; accomplish missions in contested, austere and congested environments, characterized by lack of structure, adversarial actions, and minimal a priori knowledge; and provide force reduction through self-learning vehicles that can operate in complex militarily relevant environments. This Project also matures emerging research leading to potential technology development in areas of strategic importance to the Army by bringing competitively selected Universities with research teams into Technical Alliances.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command.\n\nThis work is done in coordination with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology)."

This Project will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using ML and other AI methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI\/ML techniques to develop intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for Global Positioning System. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to develop algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI\/ML techniques to develop intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAS mapped areas. Data collected from the UAS will be converted to maneuverable information for manned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go\/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV).\n\nWork in this effort is performed by the United States (US) Army Futures Command.\n\nThis work is coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicles Advanced Technology)."

Designs and analyzes novel NGCV system level ground vehicle concepts by integrating advanced mobility, survivability, lethality, sensing and electrical\/electronic technologies to address emerging and future advanced threats.  This Project provides system level ground vehicle design concepts and performance analysis, assesses cost and performance trades, and provides real-time soldier feedback on technology performance for the Army's NGCVs. Technologies to be evaluated include high efficiency advanced powertrains, power generation, active protection systems, active blast, advanced lethality and robotic control and autonomy technologies.  The NGCV virtual experiments provide an efficient means to give warfighters an up-front, virtual hands-on operational evaluation of next generation ground vehicle concepts and emerging technologies. The Virtual Prototyping results provide critical inputs to the Army's NGCV program by providing independent technical and operational performance results, as well as assessing trades for the Army's next generation of ground combat vehicles.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority NGCV.\n\nWork in this effort is performed by the United States (US) Army Futures Command.\n\nWork in this Project is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology)."

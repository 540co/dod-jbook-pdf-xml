These responsibilities include areas unique to the DoD Executive Agent for Anti-Tamper (ATEA) and Air Force Component AT Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The ATEA is responsible for developing and implementing AT policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware\/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank\/library of AT technologies, providing security mechanisms, providing outreach and education to the DoD AT community, and funding validation and evaluations of AT implementations across all DoD acquisition programs. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AT weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F. The AF AT OPR, that is also funded by this PE and is responsible for the oversight and security of AT on all AF acquisition programs under the Program Protection Planning process and manages AF AT technology development. \n\nThe DoD ATEA coordinates technology development among the DoD Services\/Agencies, National Laboratories, and Industry.\n\nAT protects critical program information (CPI) in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands on the battlefield. AT protections permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage and the combat capabilities of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters' mission requirements. Furthermore, AT adds longevity to DoD weapon systems and critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against the system or system component. \n\nAll DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with resident critical program information (RCPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation on all DoD Weapon Systems, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government off the shelf products. As technology advances, AT continues to perform AT hardware\/software assessment capabilities. These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and\/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and\/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.\n\nThe DoD ATEA technology development strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology development across the Services which fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) and facilitate transition for programs to implement. The AT technology development and enhancement efforts include: advanced AT sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and other AT enablers. \n\nThe Air Force AT OPR conducts Anti-Tamper technology development to meet Air Force service needs to mature promising AT technologies to transition to Air Force weapons systems. Technology development priorities are given to those technologies that most benefit AF acquisition programs.  These activities are coordinated through the ATEA as a part of the ATEA technology development roadmap and to coordinate with Navy and Army AT technology development efforts.\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding."

The ATEA will also coordinate with the Service AT personnel to foster communication and understand what programs, Services are developing for their AT implementation. Emerging research areas such as materials, cryptography and electronic circuits have the potential to bring new AT capabilities with reduced power needs and smaller form factor. The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point they can be transitioned to a program office or    industry for implementation in our weapon systems.

            "val": "Program Element 0605831F is one of two direct funded AFLCMC acquisition workforce program elements.  The other AFLCMC acquisition workforce civilian pay program element is 0605898F Management Headquarters.\n\nThe Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) equips U.S. and allied forces with operational weapon systems in support of military and national security operations.  The acquisition and product support workforce provides cutting edge weapon systems, sustainment capabilities, and is charged with providing management, tools, and technical and business capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs throughout their life cycle.  The direct funded acquisition workforce funded in this program element will support all phases of acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel.  These program elements support both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nIn FY21, the Air Force consolidated six of the eight previous AFLCMC program elements (0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, and 0605832F) into program element 0605831F Capability Integration.  A database error prevented the Air Force from moving all funding in program element 0605832F Advanced Program Technology to program element 0605831F Acquisition Workforce Capability Integration.  The Air Force requests a technical adjustment to realign the remaining program element 0605832F Advanced Program Technology funding ($40.768M) to program element 0605831F Capability Integration, Project 665832 Advanced Program Technology.\n\nThe acq workforce program element consolidation enables AFLCMC to better manage variability associated with attrition rates, hiring timelines, demographic changes, and Average Work Year Costs (AWYC) across the AFLCMC enterprise.  In addition, the consolidation will reduce the need for technical adjustments, ATRs, and\/or BTRs in the year of execution.  Finally, the consolidation provides greater flexibility to prevent potential hiring freezes and\/or reductions-in-force.  The consolidation maintains transparency associated with funding, authorizations, and AWYC's due to the establishment of new Projects within the consolidated PE 0605831F Program.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

Additionally, a $0.031M decrease was due to a requirement to fund a cancelled year RDT&E requirement. In FY20, an $8M increase was due to an Air Force requested transfer from PEs 0605826F ($3M), 0605827F ($2M), and 0605832F ($3M).  The FY21 PB funds 9,838 authorizations.  $1,366.3M is budgeted for civilian pay (assumes technical adjustment of $40.8M from PE 0605832F) and $36.515M for non-pay requirements. The FY21 budgeted Average Work Year Cost (AWYC) is $0.139M. The $1,138.162M FY21 (FY20 PB) to FY21 (FY21 PB) increase is due to the AFLCMC acquisition workforce consolidation from eight to six program elements.

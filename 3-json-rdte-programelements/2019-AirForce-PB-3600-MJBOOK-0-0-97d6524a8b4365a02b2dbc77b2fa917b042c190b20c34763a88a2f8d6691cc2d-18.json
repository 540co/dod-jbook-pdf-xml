This effort integrates and demonstrates advanced flight vehicle technologies that improve the performance and supportability of existing and future aerospace vehicles. System level integration brings together aerospace vehicle technologies along with avionics, propulsion, and weapon systems for demonstration in a near-realistic operational environment.  Integration and technology demonstrations reduce the risk and time required to transition technologies into operational aircraft. Projects in this program have been coordinated through the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602601F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

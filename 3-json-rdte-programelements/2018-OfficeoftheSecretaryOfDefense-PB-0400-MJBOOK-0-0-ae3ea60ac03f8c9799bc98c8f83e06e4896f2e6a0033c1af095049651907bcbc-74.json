            "val": "The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) and the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (R&E) matters.  In this capacity, the ASD(R&E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for Department of Defense (DoD) R&E programs.  Additionally, the ASD(R&E) provides technical support to the USD(AT&L) on R&E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&E) (OASD(R&E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&E program and its impacts to the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts.  \n\nThe PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the ASD(R&E).  The Defense Laboratory Office mission is to craft policy and provide the oversight necessary to both preserve current and develop future DoD in-house laboratory capability such that they continue to generate mission-critical innovations that increase the U.S. military advantage and enhance U.S. national security.  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and supports the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) personnel and quality of workforce; and (3) technology transfer.\n\nThe PE provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the ASD(R&E) in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&T) program, and ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis project conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds and to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.\n\nThe DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&E programs resides in the ASD(R&E).  The ASD(R&E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.\n\nThe PE provides funding for Critical Technology Assessments within ASD(R&E).  Critical Technology Assessments provide the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of DoD technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies; determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries; and determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  \n\nThis PE also provides funding for Data Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis to establish a joint analysis capability to conduct comprehensive assessments of unclassified information losses, engaging acquisition and intelligence sources to determine consequences and appropriate preventative\/mitigation actions."

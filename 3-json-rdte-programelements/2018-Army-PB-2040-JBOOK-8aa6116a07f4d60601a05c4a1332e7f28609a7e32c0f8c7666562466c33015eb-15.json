            "val": "The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) product office has full life-cycle management responsibility of the DoD authoritative biometrics enterprise repository system, known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS).  BEC Increment 0 is comprised of the current version (v1.2) of DoD ABIS and the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) which is DoD ABIS v1.3. DoD ABIS supports identity superiority capabilities for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.  DoD ABIS provides matching, sharing, and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-modal biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm, and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making retain, capture, or release decisions.  Biometric Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) is the Army Program of Record for the current Army collection capability.  DoD ABIS has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).\n\nThe Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) is the Executive Manager for Army Biometrics and the DoD proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services.  DFBA leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers. These directives are carried out by the DFBA Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). OCS coordinates all science and technology (S&T) efforts and oversees the RDT&E program.\n\nJustification:\nFY18 RDT&E funding in the amount of $5.5 million (DT2: Non-MIP Biometrics) enables the BEC product office to continue the DoD ABIS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  Funding supports a required update to the Search core, transaction manager and the authoritative repository, as well as improved \/ enhanced interoperability with FBI, Department of Homeland Security and other government entities.  Updates to the current Electronic Biometric Transmission Standard (EBTS) which is required in order to enable International Caveat, also improves sharing of data throughout the biometric community.  This funding also supports testing of the DoD ABIS SLEP.\n\nFY 2018 funding in the amount of $0.659 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric T&E activities, including standards conformance and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) interoperability assessments, supporting DoD acquisition organizations, and providing subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders."

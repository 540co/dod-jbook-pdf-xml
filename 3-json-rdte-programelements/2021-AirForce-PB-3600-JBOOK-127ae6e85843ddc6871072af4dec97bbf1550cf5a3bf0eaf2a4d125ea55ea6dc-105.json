A database error prevented the Air Force from moving all funding in program element 0605832F Advanced Program Technology to program element 0605831F Acquisition Workforce Capability Integration.  The Air Force requests a technical adjustment to realign the remaining program element 0605832F Advanced Program Technology funding ($40.768M) to program element 0605831F Capability Integration, Project 665832 Advanced Program Technology.\n\nThe Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) equips U.S. and allied forces with operational weapon systems in support of military and national security operations.  The acquisition and product support workforce provides cutting edge weapon systems, sustainment capabilities, and is charged with providing management, tools, and technical and business capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs throughout their life cycle.  The direct funded acquisition workforce funded in this program element will support all phases of acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel.  These program elements support both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

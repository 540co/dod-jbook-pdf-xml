            "val": "FD2: Soldier Robotics Systems for Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing \/ transitioning technology.  Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives \/ Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation \/ transition from Science & Technology (S&T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle and maneuver under their own power. \n\nFY 2019 RDTE funds enable support to capability development of the Common Robotics System (Vehicle), Common Robotic System (Light Reconnaissance) Robot (LRR) (CRS(LR)), Common Robotic System (Universal Controller) (CRS(UC)), Common Robotic System (Communication Link) (CRS(CL)), Common Robotic System (Mission Command\/Artificial Intelligence) (CRS(MS\/AI)), Render Safe - Sets, Kits and Outfits (RS-SKO), Enhanced Robotics Payload (ERP), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN); small, pocket sized, airborne sensors, etc. Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision).  \n\nFY 2019 RDTE funding also supports the Soldier Exoskeleton. The Exoskeleton amplifies the strength, endurance, and mobility of its operator, the Soldier. The Soldier Exoskeleton capabilities provide the Army with a deployable, personal tactical performance enhancer. Soldier Exoskeleton variants will be capable of operating in a wide range of environments, enhancing combat operations.\n\nFD3: The Battery Modernization & Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier, and to reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just three. Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.\n\nFD9: Robotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing \/ transitioning technology.  Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives \/ Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation \/ transition from Science & Technology (S&T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C.

This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits.\n\nFY 2019 RDTE funds enable support to capability development of Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Dismounted Engineer Mobility System (DEMS), modular mission payloads, Route Clearance & Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Robotic Combat Vehicle - Robotic Wingman (RCV-RW), etc. Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision).  \n\nFY 2019 RDTE Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems funding supports Leader Follower and Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitions from Technology Demonstrations to Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&S) development and initial prototype testing.  This will stress the autonomy systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations.\n\nFD9: Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF) will provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. TWV-LF will provide capability for a manned Leader vehicle with up to seven (7) unmanned Follower vehicles. Initial efforts by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) will control up to three (3) optionally manned Follower vehicles with a designated Leader vehicle. The manned Leader vehicle wirelessly provides direction and speed guidance to the Follower vehicles to follow the Leader vehicle with no driver input or unmanned. The primary purposes for Leader Follower are to improve Force Protection and increase Logistics Throughput. Funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology.\n\nFY 2019 RDTE Leader Follower funding will continue the fabrication and testing of up to 140 Leader Follower PLS A1 vehicles for user operational assessment in FORSCOM identified units.  Systems will go through an Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) safety assessment and plan for Urgent Materiel Release based on the signed Leader Follower Directed Requirement.  The issued Leader Follower systems will go through a 12 month Operational Technology Demonstration on CONUS installations to provide user feedback and assessment on the truck performance to inform a future milestone decision for a follow on Leader Follower program of record."

Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives \/ Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation \/ transition from Science & Technology (S&T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits.\n\nFY 2019 RDTE funds enable support to capability development of Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Dismounted Engineer Mobility System (DEMS), modular mission payloads, Route Clearance & Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Robotic Combat Vehicle - Robotic Wingman (RCV-RW), etc. Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision).  \n\nFY 2019 RDTE Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems funding supports Leader Follower and Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitions from Technology Demonstrations to Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&S) development and initial prototype testing.  This will stress the autonomy systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations.\n\nTactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF) will provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. TWV-LF will provide capability for a manned Leader vehicle with up to seven (7) unmanned Follower vehicles. Initial efforts by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) will control up to three (3) optionally manned Follower vehicles with a designated Leader vehicle. The manned Leader vehicle wirelessly provides direction and speed guidance to the Follower vehicles to follow the Leader vehicle with no driver input or unmanned. The primary purposes for Leader Follower are to improve Force Protection and increase Logistics Throughput. Funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology.\n\nFY 2019 Leader Follower funding will continue the fabrication and testing of up to 140 Leader Follower PLS A1 vehicles for user operational assessment in FORSCOM identified units.  Systems will go through an Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) safety assessment and plan for Urgent Materiel Release based on the signed Leader Follower Directed Requirement.  The issued Leader Follower systems will go through a 12 month Operational Technology Demonstration on CONUS installations to provide user feedback and assessment on the truck performance to inform a future milestone decision for a follow on Leader Follower program of record."

            "val": "The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment. These advanced technology development initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.\n  \nThis program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation non-lethal capabilities and includes performing analysis, technology development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these capabilities.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next-generation non-lethal systems focus on long-range localized non-lethal effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and\/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Typical metrics include both the effectiveness of the technology, human effects and effectiveness, mitigation of high priority joint NLW capability gaps, and potential for compliance with policy and legislation.  Overarching considerations include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels and Human Effects Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged with other performers, reduction in life cycle cost upon application of the technology, and the identification of opportunities to transition technology to higher categories of development."

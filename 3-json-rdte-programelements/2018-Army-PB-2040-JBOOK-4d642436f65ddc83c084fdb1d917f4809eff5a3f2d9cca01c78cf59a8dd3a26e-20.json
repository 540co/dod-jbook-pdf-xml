            "val": "This Program Element (PE) investigates and advances technologies, techniques, and tools for representation of the physical and human environment for use in military planning and operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric, and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and force protection planning and operations; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities. Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances force protection technologies across the range of military operations, including expedient protection and hardened construction to defeat complex threats. This Project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate ground obstacles for manned and unmanned vehicles; characterizes austere navigation environments, including complex urban environments, and designs and evaluates materiel solutions, including rapidly emplace bridging and expedient repair technologies, to allow austere port and airfield entry of forces; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms, and bridges. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; creates tools (including advanced models and simulations) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions; and supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants, such as bacteria and molds, in air handling equipment and building materials.  \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology).  \n\nWork in this PE is led, managed, or performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Research includes methods for radical, effective sensor systems and materials to 'tag' features, items, and people of interest; these capabilities are based upon novel and emerging light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor systems and an array of other sensor systems for intermittent and persistent optimal data collection, object identification, and classification for ground operations.

This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This effort investigates technologies to protect facility indoor air quality from contaminants such as mold, bacteria, and viruses in work and living spaces, as well as develops methods to optimize sustainable operations and maintenance to minimize lifecycle costs. In addition, technologies from this work mature a better understanding of critical infrastructure interdependencies to support sustainable and flexible facility operations and evolving mission requirements.  \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

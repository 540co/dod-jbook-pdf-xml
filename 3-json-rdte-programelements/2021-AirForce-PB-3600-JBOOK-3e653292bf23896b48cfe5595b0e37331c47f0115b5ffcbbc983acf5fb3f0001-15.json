The COE conducts highly specialized analysis, assessment and performance monitoring of military and civil CNS\/ATM capabilities and ensures manned and unmanned aircraft system conformance to national and international civil aviation standards allowing safe and efficient access to global airspace. COE expertise is provided to Headquarters Air Force, AF Major Commands (MAJCOM), and weapon system program offices. This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 30 AF weapon system program offices with resident CNS\/ATM technical expertise. \n\nThis funding enables the COE to monitor and participate in government and industry technical forums and U.S. and International civil aviation standards bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) and others. These organizations are responsible for the development and assessment of international civil aviation standards for safe and efficient flight operations in worldwide airspace. COE personnel analyze civil aviation standards as they are being developed and work to influence them to support Department of Defense (DoD) interests.   \n\nSpecific technical and engineering criteria established by U.S. and International civil aviation standards are documented in generic performance matrices (GPMs).  The COE works with MAJCOM and program office personnel and develops strategies to implement CNS\/ATM capability requirements on AF weapon systems and tailor the GPMs to each platform's unique avionics architecture and operational mission.  After completion of CNS\/ATM component integration and testing, COE personnel validate platform performance against the aviation standards necessary for the platform to operate safely and efficiently in worldwide airspace. This performance assessment is submitted to the aircraft program office and becomes part of their Airworthiness certification package.    \n\nThe COE provides technical analysis and assessments of CNS\/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment throughout the lifecycle of manned and unmanned aircraft platforms.  Efforts include and are not limited to performance assessment, test support, performance monitoring, interoperability testing, cybersecurity assessments, and the development and assessment of CNS\/ATM capabilities for unmanned platforms.  Unmanned platform support includes, and is not limited to location-specific Ground Based Detect and Avoid (GBDAA) radar and airspace characterization, and evaluation of emerging unmanned aircraft system technologies.\n\nThe COE administers and manages multiple contracts including the electronic Global Air Traffic Management (iGATM) catalog to enable centralized procurement of CNS\/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment, navigation data, and technical engineering services for aircraft platform program offices and other mission partners. Technical engineering services may include and are not limited to performance monitoring, interoperability testing, cybersecurity assessments, and the development and assessment of CNS\/ATM capabilities for emerging unmanned platform technologies such as location-specific GBDAA characterization. The iGATM catalog may also offer hardware, software, risk kits, operations and training materials, and the installation and check-out of GBDAA and other emerging unmanned see and avoid technologies and systems. These contracts are used by aircraft program offices across the DoD, among other federal agencies, and in support of foreign military sales.\n\nThe Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) electronic navigation database is developed and maintained by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) and contains critical safety of flight information used by all DoD flight crews to fly Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) procedures, safely navigate airways and fly Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs) to civil and military airfields worldwide.  The COE performs periodic and event driven audits of NGA and alternate industry navigation source data providers and navigation data software tools required by civil aviation authorities.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CNS\/ATM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

These services\/capabilities are in direct support of Combatant Commanders, the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer, Military Services, and Defense Agencies. The DSO is the focal point for electromagnetic spectrum analysis and the development of integrated spectrum plans and strategies to address current and future needs for DoD spectrum access. In addition, DSO serves as DoD's spectrum advocate at national and international forums and conducts extensive outreach to both industry and government. DSO also implements enterprise spectrum management capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency and agility to improve spectrum-dependent capabilities in support of United States and Coalition operations. This includes acquiring, implementing and sustaining the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS) which provides an integrated catalog of joint net-centric spectrum management tools and services. Electromagnetic Spectrum Management enables information dominance through effective spectrum operations."

The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment (EME). Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts.\n \nImproved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use.

JOERAD develops algorithms and provides analytical capabilities to perform real-time risk assessments to evaluate platform\/system safety and identify equipment limitations in the operational EM environment. JOERAD enables operators to make critical decisions about the hazards associated with the use of ordnance within complex EM environments. A SSRA is performed by program managers and materiel developers on all programs that are acquiring or incorporating spectrum-dependent systems or equipment per DoDI 4650.1.

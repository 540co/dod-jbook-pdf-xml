Project Unit 3386, Major Range and Test Facility Base Marine Vessels provides the overhauls and preventative maintenance of the 23 Major Range and Test Facility Base marine vessels located at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, Pacific Missile Range Facility, Honolulu, HI, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport Nanoose and Dabob Bay Ranges, Keyport, WA, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD, and Naval Undersea Warfare Center Detachment Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center.  The Test and Evaluation activities make up the Navy portion of the Department of Defense's Major Range and Test Facility Base. These activities are chartered to perform Test and Evaluation for the development and acquisition of technology advanced weapons systems. Core Test and Evaluation capabilities and capacity are operated to obtain weapons system performance documentation for acquisition program milestone decisions to provide operational forces with effective weapons systems. This program provides Navy Acquisition Program Managers required test capabilities; lowers cost of Test and Evaluation; removes cost and scheduling impact of providing their own Test and Evaluation resources; and retains the physical airspace, land space and sea space needed to conduct testing."

The Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center  Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  \n\nAtlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  \n\nMajor test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 \/Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity, a Mark 30 undersea target Intermediate Maintenance Activity, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.\n\nAtlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier\/marine area include fully equipped machine \/fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track."

These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and Test and Evaluation  aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its Test and Evaluation mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range, which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.  This project funds costs that are not chargeable to customers.\n\nThe funding increase in FY19 support sustainment of four additional advanced high fidelity threat emitters at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division ranges."

This includes 50,000 square miles of airspace, 39,375 square miles of sea space, and 7,950 acres of land space.  Product areas include aircraft systems flight test and evaluation, carrier suitability certification, test article preparation, installed system test and evaluation, and modeling and simulation support of the acquisition process.   The Test and Evaluation Group, Patuxent River, performs development and operational test and evaluation of manned and unmanned air vehicle systems, including mission systems, equipment, subsystems, components, and support systems.  This project also provides test and evaluation facilities for air-breathing propulsion systems and extensive facilities for conducting both installed and uninstalled aircraft engine development and test and evaluation.

These vessels are used to launch and recover torpedoes, acoustic systems, and other weapons, provide range surveillance and clearance, and can be configured as a target.  Overhauls are required to operate ships over 300 tons overseas in compliance with American Bureau of Shipping \"Load Line\" certification requirements.  Major preventative maintenance requiring shipyard support is also performed during these periods to mitigate risks of failures.\n\nFunding in the amount of $2M was realigned on July 26, 2017, from FY17 Major Range and Test Facility Base Marine Vessels project (0605864N\/3386) to Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division project (0605864N\/0653) to cover cost associated with the FY17 locality pay increase that Congress approved for Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake inside the Navy budget cycle."

The priorities for the CG\/CD program are to develop concept\/concept of operations and explore near\/far-term technological and non-technological solutions to war fighting gaps across all naval warfare areas. The associated experimentation efforts include planning, systems engineering and integration, modeling and simulation support, event execution,\ndata collection, analysis, and assessment for a wide-range of experimentation efforts including the examination of prototypes, tactical development and evaluation, support for Science and Technology (S&T) innovation, and program of record system development; venues such as workshops, seminars, war games, limited objective experiments, limited technical experiments, and live at-sea events are used to execute these experimentation efforts.\n(2) Provides naval warfare subject matter expertise, experiment planning expertise, and analysis expertise to plan, execute, and assess experimentation for the fleets and warfighting development centers (WDC) at the operational and tactical levels. This includes a focus on WDC integration role, maritime command and control (C2), advanced cross-domain warfighting, and maritime operations centers (MOCS)\/operational level of war (OLW) lines of operations. Seeks to solve fleet-identified warfighting gaps (referenced within the Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL), Urgent Operational Needs Statements (UONS), Fleet Commander's Guidance, etc.). The experimentation and prototyping efforts support the \"last tactical mile\" of many Navy S&T programs by supporting those programs where the technology is mature enough, but requires evaluation on or by a \"fleet asset\" - ships, airplanes, submarines, and sailors.\n(3) Provides modeling and simulation (M&S) support to Navy experimentation efforts. M&S is used to stimulate decision making during seminar-style and system war gaming experiments and provides the simulated operational environment and capabilities with high-fidelity models such as the Joint Semi-Automated Force (JSAF) program. Additionally, where applicable, the Navy Simulation System (NSS) \"Monte Carlo\" model is also used to give high confidence solutions and outcomes to complex warfighting problems.\n(4) Provides for focused, solution-driven tactics development and evaluation through experimentation. This effort is focused on developing near-term doctrine solutions to address specific fleet-identified tactical issues.\n\nMaritime Concept Generation and Concept Development products include:\n- Concepts (signed by the CNO that influence future funding and technological development)\n- Enabling concepts\n- Concepts of operations (CONOPS)\n- Final experimentation reports (including findings, insights, and recommendations and DOTMLPF change recommendations and plans for action)\n- Experiment Analysis Summary Reference Documents\n- New\/revised doctrinal and Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures publications\n- White papers (think pieces) intended to generate further discussion within Navy leadership\nSpecific products are listed in the Accomplishments\/Plans section of this exhibit."

Continuing the development of the supporting doctrine, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Command and Control (C2) as well as the integration and interoperability required between weapon systems and decision makers requires a methodical experimental approach. FY20 experiments (both at-sea and via war simulation) will strive to achieve the objectives as laid out in the accompanying action\/implementation plan. Specific events planned for FY20 include:\n\nHUMAN-MACHINE INTEGRATION (HMI) OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) EXPERIMENTATION - This effort will examine the incorporation of AI capabilities into Naval technologies, TTPs, and C2 processes such as the development of AI-enabled Tactical Decision Aids that autonomously transition data into information.\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC MANEUVER WARFARE (EMW) EXPERIMENTATION\nNavy will conduct multiple events designed to synchronize and align experiment initiatives with Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW) tasks to provide solutions to EMW capability gaps and to ensure development of doctrine and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) is synchronized with the introduction of new technology and provides the Fleet and Fleet trainers with required doctrine tools at the tactical and operational levels. \n\nOFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH (ONR) TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION GAMES (TIGS).  This series of workshops executed in conjunction with ONR will give Fleet operators the opportunity to examine emerging capabilities and determine potential concepts of employment to effectively incorporate innovative capabilities into Fleet warfighting missions and tasks.  \n\nMARITIME CYBERSPACE EXPERIMENT - This classified effort builds upon prior year experiments to further examine Navy vulnerabilities to adversary cyber capabilities.\n\nPANDARRA WAVE 20 At-Sea Experiment - This classified effort builds upon prior year experiments to further examine Navy vulnerabilities to adversary Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.\n\nRED NITRUM 20 At-Sea Experiment - This classified effort builds upon prior year experiments to further examine Navy vulnerabilities to adversary electronic attack capabilities.\n\nCOUNTER-UNMANNED SYSTEMS (C-UXS) EXPERIMENT SERIES - This effort will build upon prior year experimentation by examining emerging TTPs and technologies to counter the proliferation of unmanned undersea, surface, and air vehicles. The series will consist of workshops focused on countering various types of unmanned systems culminating in an at-sea cross domain Counter-Unmanned Systems (C-UxS) experiment.\n\nNAVAL FORCE INTEGRATION EXPERIMENTATION\nNaval Force Integration experiments (workshops, War simulations, and at-sea events) will examine integration and interoperability issues associated with coordinated USN-USMC operations. The primary goal of the campaign is to reexamine Navy and Marine Corps organizational and command relationships in order to enable effective Naval operations across the maritime domain. Specific events currently planned for FY20 include:\n\nLARGE SCALE EXERCISE (LSE) 2020 - This Naval exercise at the Operational to Tactical Level of War in a maritime theater with assigned live and synthetic assets in stressing competitor conditions will provide a comprehensive assessment of the three enabling components of Fleet design - Integration, Distribution, and Maneuver.\n\nMINE WARFARE (MIW) EXPERIMENTATION\nThrough workshops, war simulations and at-sea events, the FY20 efforts will continue to examine TTP and C2 construct for our future Mine Counter Measures (MCM) force as new programs of record and unmanned systems come on line, and legacy systems begin to decommission.\n\nOPERATIONAL LEVEL OF WAR\/TACTICAL LEVEL OF WAR (OLW\/TLW) INTEGRATION EXPERIMENTATION\nOLW\/TLW Integration experiments (workshops, war simulations and at-sea events) will examine current and emerging TTPs and current and emerging technologies with a goal of identifying innovative solutions that will support the capstone naval concept of a Fleet Design based on integration, distribution, and maneuver. Specific events planned for FY20 include:\n\nDISTRIBUTED MARITIME OPERATIONS (DMO) Experimentation - This effort will address key DMO concept action plan items such as the examination of Fleet Command and Maritime Operation Center (MOC) capabilities, and the employment of unmanned systems in support of DMO.\n\nSPACE EXPERIMENT SERIES - This effort will build upon prior year experimentation on the employment of space-based capabilities at the OLW\/TLW. \n\nEMERGING CONCEPTS WAR SIMULATIONS - This effort will employ multiple seminar war simulations to examine emerging concepts such as Fleet Design, Distributed Maritime Operations, and multiple feeder concepts.\n\nFOR FY20 CONCEPT GENERATION\/CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT (CG\/CD)\nContinue CG\/CD development efforts that carry-over from FY19:\nAdditional concepts and CONOPs to be developed in FY20 will be determined through the CG\/CD development process and additional external factors. Concepts under consideration include Unmanned Systems in support of DMO, Command and Control in support of DMO, Offensive Mine Warfare, Targeting in support of DMO, and Advanced Autonomous\/Semi-autonomous Sustainment Systems."

It contains the two projects described below:\n\nP455, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), incentivizes S&T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as \u201cseed money\u201d to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovation to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.\n\nP456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM), co-sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment (ASD(EIE)), develops advanced energy storage technologies to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of HESM are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power\/energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, (2) increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (3) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services and will be used to extend the operational performance and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configuration. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)."

OE Watson is developing a cognitive assistant that combines deep learning, quantitative analysis, and analytic wargames. Funding also allowed for adoption of a single knowledge management tool(SEMS2.0) re-purposing from SERDP\/ESTCP to OECIF.  The tool has been adapted for OECIF and the FY18 call of proposals and selection is utilizing this new capability.\n\nSpace Solar Power team held the program kickoff, discussed the application for potential users, and defined metrics of success.  Initial focus is on current solar cell technology with additional investment in perovskites.\n\nThe Ultra High Density Hybrid Energy Storage Module effort (HD HESM) is a follow-on from P456.  The team initiated contracting through the Air Force Research Lab for a new High Density System, developed cross service System Requirements (Navy, Army and AF), and initiated platform analysis for HD HESM installation and operation.\n\nOECIF continues to co-sponsor, with SERDP\/ESTCP, emerging Waste-to-Energy Technology development."

J-DEPLOI will complete software development into MBPS, provide joint data integration, and complete verification and testing of J-DEPLOI capabilities.    \nFY 2015 vehicle efforts enter the final year of funding. The Automation\/Smart Cruise Control program concludes convoy vehicle testing using smart cruise control.  TVEK completes baselining performance data; integration and testing of the anti-idle system (DC\/DC, inverter, motor\/generator, 6T battery, HVAC, and cabin heating); electromagnetic interference testing on TVEK electrified components; and Functional and Preliminary Design Reviews.

The Reliable, Efficient, Tactical UAS Power System program will have an engine for testing.  Hybrid Tiger completes airframe fabrication\/energy system integration for first flight; evaluates energy performance; tunes software algorithms; refines benchtop assumptions with real-world flight measurements; updates the simulation to match measurements, and informs the hybrid energy design process. The Aluminum Seawater Power program completes breadboard combustor design review and performs testing; selects product-removal hardware and tests; and selects water replenishment hardware and tests. The HTVE-UE program continues tech development including pool testing and final preparations for 1-year at-sea test, continues studies and analyses related to HTV characterization\/environmental considerations and various CONOPS. The JP-8 Based Fuel Cell Power program conducts physical integration of the JP-8 reformer and solid oxide fuel cell and all supporting hardware; and conducts the first two iterations of system level tests to shape system design.       \nThe FY 2017 efforts continue.  The OSCIPPT team completes first release of the subsystem controls, the interface description document, and the coordination control for FY2017 physical architecture. TEAPPS identifies candidate thermal management system architectures and control schemes using the validated dynamic thermal modeling toolset, tests the thermal performance of a single-diode advanced thermal packaging module with phase change material, and completes fabrication of the first of two prototype thermal management systems for demonstration. PTROL team integrates and test systems for two FY 2018 demonstrations: laser power sent over optical fiber to an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV), and greater than 500W of power transmitted over 300m to a stationary receiver.  The W-Band Power Beaming team completes high power testing of samples of promising ceramic absorber materials developed in the first two years; completes modeling and fabrication of the Sterling engine heat pipe; and models collector antenna, integrated absorber, and heat transfer interface. SSP designs models electromagnetic antennas and manifolding; completes efficiency and sensitivity simulations of discrete rectifier; models rf to dc sensitivity, harvesting beam width, and interaction between rectifier loading and Rectenna. \nFY 2018 will be 1-year studies that illuminate S&T Gaps for Operational Energy in the near-, mid-, and far-term.  These efforts are expected to be complete and shape and influence the next DoD OE Strategy."

As Defense-Wide funding, it incentivizes S&T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as \u201cseed money\u201d to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovations to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects."

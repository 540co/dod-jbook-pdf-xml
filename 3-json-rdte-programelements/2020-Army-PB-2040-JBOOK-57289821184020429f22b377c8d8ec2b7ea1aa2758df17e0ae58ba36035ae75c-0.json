Prototypes will be used to fully evaluate distributed cooling and legacy approaches; 3) Technology Complex Compound Materials for Thermal\/Energy Management prototypes will be manufactured and tested for suitability in high velocity impacts.  The planned compound is Coordinative Molecular Bond Armor Material and has potential to provide ballistics and thermal protection; 4) Upgrades are planned for the Advanced Measurement Optical Range facility to support laser radar development and testing.  . 5) HardWare-In-the-Loop (HWIL) for both open-loop device characterization and closed-loop dynamic hardware-in-the-loop simulation to characterize guidance and track-loop performance.  Simulate trajectories, and engagement would be utilized to drive the HWIL simulations (e.g. 3DOF, 6DOF).  6) Integration of a Fire Control (FC) for the near-term Long-Range Weapon System requirements for initial operational capability. Long range hypersonic weapon analysis, integration and fielding support."

Implemented an enterprise-level risk management framework certification for the NCR IADS ground circuit initiative (GCI) communications network to support information assurance accreditation for the network that supports all weapons and sensor communications.\n\t\nIntegrated four wide area surveillance sensors into the NORAD surveillance architecture\n\t\t\nDelivered the initial increment of capability and conducted a successful program review of the Digital Attack Surface Execution Environment (DASEE) capability development project with ASD R&E.  ASD R&E approved an installation at the Aerospace Defense Facility - Colorado (ADF-C) to enable processing of effective processing of large quantities of intelligence messages for incorporation in big data\/artificial intelligence applications. \n\nDomestic Operations Awareness and Assessment Response Tool (DAART) was used extensively for all the major domestic events such as the multiple hurricanes, the Hawaii volcano eruptions, Western wildfires, and event monitoring around the national capital during the fourth of July celebrations.  The tool was also upgraded extensively to enable optical character reading of UAV video feeds with proprietary feeds, so that metadata for the event could be distributed with the video for improved use of the system. \n\t\nCyber Warrior Training Capability provided Missile Defense Agency (MDA) with a virtual representation of the Network Intrusion incident Monitoring (NIM) system as part of a cyber defense training program to develop and maintain proficiency for MDA cyber defense operators responsible for monitoring the weapon system networks.  This system was verified and validated through independent assessment sponsored by MDA.\n\nCoordinated fielding of a STRATCOM Strategic Instruction (SI) 538-02, BMDS Physical Security Program-compliant Integrated Electronic Security Systems (IESS) for Site 512 and Site K AN\/TPY-2 Forward Based Mode (FBM) radar sites.\n\nCoordinated implementation of an Authority to Operate (ATO) for the Integrated Electronic Security Systems (IESS) at Kyogamisaki Communications Site (KCS) and Site 4a AN\/TPY-2 Forward Based Mode (FBM) radar sites to ensure compliance with DoDI 8510.01 Risk Management Framework.\n3. \n\nPerformed DOTMLPF analysis of GMD software version GS7A prior to hardware\/software fielding.  GS7A software represents a major redesign and upgrade of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system. Post GS7A fielding, conducted DOTMLPF analysis on Warfighter impacts from the development and fielding of a GFC 7A dot build implementing a new buffer zone paradigm.\n\nICW 100 MD BDE and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), identified requirements for and conducted a trade study the GMD Conduct of Fire Trainer (GCOFT) development effort.  MDA has since issued a Task Instruction to Boeing Corporation to develop Courses of Action and cost estimates addressing documented Warfighter's training deficiencies.\n\nICW MDA and USNORTHCOM, ensured Warfighter requirements were considered and included in the development of four construction packages required for the build-out of a new missile field at Fort Greely, Alaska (Missile Field 4), which will host an additional 20 interceptors, bringing the GMD inventory from 44 to 64 by 2024.\n\nDeveloped and fielded an Army-specific C2BMC Planner Employment Concept.  The concept was subsequently validated at the MDA-sponsored Planning Exercise (PLANEX) in EUCOM in Aug 18.\n\nWorked in concert with MDA to establish the requirement for a Military GMD System Trainer (GST) Operator Course.  The course was developed by Boeing and transitioned to SMDC for presentation to the Warfighter.  This course trains soldiers to operate the GST in the absence of prime contractor computer system operators, increasing training opportunities for the Warfighter.\n\nWorked with MDA during the development of two unique AN\/TPY-2 FBM Planner prototypes.  ICW MDA, developed the Military Utility Assessment (MUA) criteria and a FBM Planner Employment Concept.  Participated in EUCOM-centric MUA in Sep 2018 and will participate in INDOPACOM-centric MUA now scheduled for Jan 2019.\n\nDeveloped and delivered Army requirements for an AN\/TPY-2 FBM-specific training device to be developed by MDA.   Device must support individual and crew training and certification on FBM unique tasks through tables IV and VIII.\n\nCompleted commercial power project at the Kyogamisaki Communications Site (KCS) greatly reducing noise and improving Host Nation relations.\n\nCompleted contractor to Soldier conversion at FBM Site 512 in Israel.\nFY 2019 Plans:"

In order to support Mission Command, the SMDC BLCSE Node used JEMS to convert and communicate with all Mission Command systems.  JEMS monitored Blue force simulation messaging and turned that data into tactical messages used by the Command Post of the Future (CPoF).   Also, JEMS was used to fill intelligence reporting gaps providing some level of situational awareness to military role players.  JEMS also monitored health status of select Red force targets as those targets were neutralized and indicated those targets were destroyed (to mission command).\n2) The Future Force Experimentation Air Defense Simulation (FFEADS) was installed in the SMDC S3I SiL to assist with HEL Studies and Analysis.  Also, FFEADS was used in support of Unified Challenge (UC-18.2) at the Fires Battle Lab by providing conceptual IAMD Weapons and C2 systems for the environment.  The simulation supported sites at Fires Battle Lab, Ft. Benning Lab, Ft. Rucker Lab and Ft. Leonardwood Lab and provided the only IAMD Tool for the environment and C2 system at multiple sites and echelons.  RTOS and FFEADS were used to test conceptual systems to battle the enemy of the future and determine how Commanders would utilize those capabilities.\nSupported Nimble Fire 18A & 18B at the JIAMDO Virtual Warfare Center supporting with conceptual IAMD Weapons and C2 systems. (JXX, LTAMDS and IAMD Integration).  Utilized the models to test conceptual systems to battle the enemy of the future and determine how Commanders would utilize those capabilities in a Joint Community.  Also tested Kill Chain procedures between Joint Systems and C2 authority.  Supported Agile Cutlass for JXX Advanced Engagement Concept (AEC) testing between the Marines and Army.  This was to test AEC concept between Army and Joint sensors and shooters.  FFEADS was installed at the US Air Force Distributed Missions Operations Center (DMOC) at Kirkland AFB, to replicate Patriot, THAAD, Threat Generation and IAMD C2 Operations.  This was to assist with Joint Kill Chain Events, Virtual Flag and other studies and exercises.  Software is supporting SMDC down select for the HEL-TVD Program where we are proposing to utilize a version of Integrated Fire Command and Control Environment (IFC2E) as a new system called BMC3 (Battle Management Command Control and Communications).\n\nProvided simulation support to the IAMDC Abu Dhabi:  ? HawkEX ? Supported with Hawk Simulation, Patriot Simulation and THAAD Simulation.\n? Falcon Shield ? Supported with Hawk, Patriot, THAAD and IFC2E ? Desert Flag - Supported with Hawk, Patriot, THAAD and IFC2E ? Moved consoles from IAMDC to Al Dhafra\n\n3) Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) was used to support a wide range of internal SMDC Studies and Analysis efforts to include Military Utility of HE Laser against UAV\/ISR (SMDC), Adversary Centric Plans Assessment '18 (JFCC-IMD), Allied Partner Modeling Study-AMD, Directed Energy Analysis (SMDC), IBCS Capabilities Production  Document  II  (PEO-MS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)  Optimization (SMDC), EUCOM \/CENTCOM Force Mix Analysis (JFCC-IMD), Upper\/Lower Tier Regional Analysis (MDA), Joint Regional IAMD Capability Mix II (Joint Staff), Holistic Missile Defense (JFCC-IMD), and Allied Partner Modeling Study-AMD II (SMDC).\n\nAdditionally, EADSIM is being used by the SMDC Technical Center to virtually demonstrate the capabilities of the two competing High Energy Laser Tactical Vehicle Demonstrator (HEL TVD) contractors.   Funding resourced EADSIM modifications needed to support this effort.  \n\nEADSIM replaced DESIM in DTS S\/S 6.4   DTS S\/S is used to train the C2BMC crew.\n\nMissile Defense Agency DTWX began using EADSIM to replace DESIM for modeling upper and lower tier BMDS systems in CCMD exercises.\n\nEADSIM was used by Aegis BMD in an operator in the loop capability to support assessments of Pre-Planned Responses (PPR) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).  Aegis BMD Block 5.1 capabilities were funded and implemented in 2018.   EADSIM was also used by Aegis for CCMD exercises over VACCSIM.\n\nUSSTRATCOM J5 and J8 used EADSIM for operational planning, ISR, and electronic warfare.  Most recent letter of support attached.\n\nEADSIM was successfully used to identify, test, and refine courses of action for defending the Northern Approaches against air and missile threats in the FY18 Vista Rampart (VR) Wargame. \n\nEADSIM provided modeling capability for a new classified Army sensor, which will be used to demonstrate the sensor in CCMD events.\n\nCompleted CEMA enhancements in EADSIM to support analysis and experimentation.  The enhancements will increase the level of detail in EADSIM's EW modeling capabilities particularly in jamming and sensors.  \n\n4) Studies and Analysis executed 7 operational analyses\/studies on Missile Defense for the Command, Joint Staff, PEO Missiles and Space, Missile Defense Agency, and JFCC-IMD."

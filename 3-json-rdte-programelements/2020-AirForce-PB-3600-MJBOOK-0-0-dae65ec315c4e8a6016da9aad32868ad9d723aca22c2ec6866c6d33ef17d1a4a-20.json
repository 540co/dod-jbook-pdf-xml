The program has six projects, each focusing on technologies with a high potential to enhance the performance of existing and future Air Force weapon systems.  The Aerospace Fuels project develops and demonstrates improved hydrocarbon fuels and advanced propulsion systems, including those for air-breathing, high-speed\/hypersonic flight.  The Aerospace Power Technology project develops and demonstrates adaptive power and thermal management components, controls, and systems for high-power payloads and aircraft as part of energy-optimized aircraft development.  The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project develops demonstrator engines by integrating the engine cores demonstrated in the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project with low-pressure components.   The Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion project develops and demonstrates innovative rocket propulsion technologies, propellants, and manufacturing techniques.  The Advanced Aerospace Propulsion project develops the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for in-flight demonstration and for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket based).  The Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project develops and demonstrates core turbine engine technologies for current and future aircraft propulsion systems.\n\nPortions of the Aerospace Fuels, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration, and Advanced Turbine Gas Generator  projects support adaptive cycle technology demonstrations, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nProjects in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD)  Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high- pressure spool) technology developed under the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine-to-airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystems technologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with ten times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, high power extraction, integrated thermal management, and durability for widely varying mission needs."

Additionally, this project develops technologies for the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid rocket motor boosters and missile propulsion, post boost control, and aging and surveillance efforts) and tactical rockets. Characteristics such as environmental acceptability, affordability, reliability, responsiveness, reduced weight, and reduced operation and launch costs are emphasized. Increased life and performance of propulsion systems are key goals. Technology areas investigated include ground demonstrations of compact, lightweight, advanced propulsion technologies, higher efficiency energy conversion systems (derived from an improved understanding of combustion fundamentals), and high-energy propellants. Technological advances in this project could improve the performance of expendable payload capabilities by approximately twenty to fifty percent and reduce launch, operations, and support costs by approximately thirty percent. Responsiveness and operability of propulsion systems will be enhanced for reusable launch systems. Aging and surveillance thrusts for solid rocket motors could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by fifty percent, enabling motor replacement for cause. The efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The efforts in this project are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program. The efforts in this project are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee annually for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of technical goals defined by the RP21 program."

The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon- fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7. Efforts include: scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers; active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition); robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions; and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight."

The objective is to provide continuous evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and\/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components such as; inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, exhaust systems, and system level technologies such as; integrated power generators and thermal management systems on core engine performance, and durability in ground demonstrations of engine cores. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the Aircraft Propulsion Subsystem Integration Project of this program. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs."

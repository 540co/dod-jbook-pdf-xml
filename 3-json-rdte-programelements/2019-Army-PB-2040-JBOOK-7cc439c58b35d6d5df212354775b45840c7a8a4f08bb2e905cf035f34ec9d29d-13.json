The primary aim of the PE is to maximize the efficiency of research and development for force and materiel development by reducing the uncertainties associated with these threats. The PE also answers scientific and technical intelligence requirements, provides materiel for realistic testing and training, and aids in the development of countermeasures to threat systems, materiel, and technologies. Operations have increased the amount of captured threat materiel that require immediate exploitation to develop countermeasures and force protection measures for US forces. Acquisition and exploitation are executed according to Army Foreign Materiel Program (FMP) Plan prioritization and with the approval of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G2)."

Results enable highly informed decisions on future weapons concepts to develop, refine, and integrate technologies into new weapons concepts to defeat evolving threat scenarios and environments.  Technical risk reduction activities include Concept Development, Trade Studies, Model Development, Concept Experimentation, and demonstrative prototypes.  Conducts early Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (MS&A) of virtual systems, validated through integration of empirical data derived from prototypes and demonstrations.  Plans and executes pre-AoA and AoA activities as directed by ACC and Global Strike Command to prepare for major program milestone decisions (MDD, MS-A, MS-B).  Also includes institutional costs required for quick-reaction answers to activities listed above.  Examples of such efforts include but are not limited to, Next Generation Strike Weapon (NGSW) Analysis of Alternatives and Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW).\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage and execute these program activities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nBA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

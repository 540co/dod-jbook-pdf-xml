            "val": "The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is a global technical enterprise, boasting some of the best and brightest leaders in the world. It provides Revolutionary, Relevant, and Responsive science and technology (S&T) to the Warfighter. AFRL's mission is to lead the discovery, development, and integration of affordable warfighting technologies for the global air, space, and cyberspace force.\n\nIn FY 2018, PE 0602298F, Science and Technology Management - Major Headquarters Activities, project 622520, Science and Technology Management - Major HQ, was established to provide increased transparency to Congress on personnel in Major Headquarters Activities (MHA). A portion of HQ AFRL civilian manpower was transferred into this PE from the following Air Force S&T RDT&E PEs: 0601102F, Basic Research; 0602102F, Materials; 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies; 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion; 0602204F, Aerospace Sensors; 0602601F, Space Technology; 0602602F, Conventional Munitions; 0602605F, Directed Energy Technology; and 0602788F, Dominant Information Sciences and Methods.\n\nThis is an administrative realignment and not a new start. Funding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in the Air Force S&T RDT&E PEs listed above.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

It provides Revolutionary, Relevant, and Responsive science and technology (S&T) to the Warfighter. AFRL's mission is to lead the discovery, development, and integration of affordable warfighting technologies for the global air, space, and cyberspace force.\n\nIn FY 2018, PE 0602298F, Science and Technology Management - Major Headquarters Activities, project 622520, Science and Technology Management - Major HQ, was established to provide increased transparency to Congress on personnel in Major Headquarters Activities (MHA). A portion of HQ AFRL civilian manpower was transferred into this PE from the following Air Force S&T RDT&E PEs: 0601102F, Basic Research; 0602102F, Materials; 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies; 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion; 0602204F, Aerospace Sensors; 0602601F, Space Technology; 0602602F, Conventional Munitions; 0602605F, Directed Energy Technology; and 0602788F, Dominant Information Sciences and Methods.\n\nThis is an administrative realignment and not a new start. Funding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in the Air Force S&T RDT&E PEs listed above."

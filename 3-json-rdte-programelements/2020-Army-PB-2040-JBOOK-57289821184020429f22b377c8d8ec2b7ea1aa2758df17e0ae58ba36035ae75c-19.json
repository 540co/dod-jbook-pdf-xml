            "val": "The Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS) is a critical system in the Multi-Domain Operations (MDO)battle concept that will employ MDO capabilities at all echelons and allow ground based forces to project power from land into other domains to defeat highly capable enemies, secure terrain, and consolidate gains. FUAS encompasses an array of capabilities from platoon soldiers to Division Commanders. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the FUAS Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) on 12 OCT 2018. The ICD includes requirements for Scalable Control Interface (SCI), Air Launched Effects (ALE), and Purpose-Driven UAS (to include Future Tactical UAS and Advanced UAS).\n\nThe Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS) will be comprised of multiple components including the Future Tactical UAS (FTUAS) for the Brigade Combat Team (BCT), the Advanced UAS (AUAS) for the Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB), and Air Launched Effects (ALE). The FTUAS seeks to replace the RQ-7 assets within the Brigade Combat Teams. Key attributes of the FTUAS focus on Rapid Deployability, Expeditionary Maneuver, and Mobility for adaptive and agile operations. FTUAS will consist of an aircraft subsystem that will include the airframe, propulsion, avionics, communications, navigation, and software systems; aircraft-specific ground support equipment including power generation, transportation, or command and control equipment; aircraft software; and required engineering, logistics, and programmatic support. FUAS will penetrate defense-in-depth environments by employing Air Launched Effects (ALE) with teaming and swarming effects to detect, decoy, jam RADAR and communications, conduct cyber-attack, spoof and jam GPS, and kinetic engagement.\n\n\nJustification: FY 2020 FTUAS RDTE Base funding of $40.745 million (M) will be utilized for the following: 1) $18.079M to support the USARPAC Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) Demonstration, 2) $20.000M to support ALE Early Systems Analysis, 3) $2.666M provides Systems Engineering and Program Management (SEPM) to support of FTUAS and ALE development and preparation of pre-milestone decision documentation."

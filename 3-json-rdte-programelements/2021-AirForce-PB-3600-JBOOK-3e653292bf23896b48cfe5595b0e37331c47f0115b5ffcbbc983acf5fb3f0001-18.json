ATCALS development funding currently focuses on Air Traffic Control (ATC) Future Technology (formerly referred to as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System {NextGen ATS}).  The program name was changed to more accurately reflect the scope of the effort which includes military and civil capabilities\/requirements. In order to enable safe and efficient military flight operations in a changing global airspace, the ATC Future technology effort is designed to identify the warfighter's emerging airspace needs, analyze technologies, formulate requirements and positions, and advise DoD aviation and air traffic communities.\n\nATCALS ATC Future Technology supports the 2018 National Defense strategic approach to \"generate decisive and sustained U.S. military advantages\" by enabling \"forward force maneuver and posture resilience\" through the research and development of technology and strategies that support adaptive, agile basing concepts of operations while providing ATCALS capabilities necessary to ensure enduring, resilient, efficient and safe air operations.  ATC Future Technology will \"evolve innovative operational concepts\" by modernizing airfield operations and providing adaptive ATC services and systems appropriate for the current environment, which will bolster \"Dynamic Force Employment\" through scalable employment operations and globally deployable forces for the four layers of the \"Global Operating Model: \"contact, blunt, surge, and homeland\". \n\nFY21 efforts will continue to research and develop new technologies in the areas of aircraft launch and recovery for both fixed and expeditionary operations; military and civil airspace interoperability; optimization of flight operations; Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) access to civil airspace; ATC training study; DoD\/AF or civil US and international mandates (e.g., Mode-5); improved Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) software capabilities; conduct of service operational test and evaluations as required; mitigation of windfarm interference (e.g., with Infill Radars);  technology and evaluation of new civil air traffic control and landing system technologies that may have military utility to include an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Tower System technology, mobile TACAN antenna technology, and expeditionary technology development and prototyping. As these technologies and architectures mature, fixed base and deployable ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with related aircraft avionics capabilities that may be required (manned and unmanned).  ATC Future Technology analysis and recommendations will be captured in program charters and incorporated into the ATC Future Technology Strategic Roadmap.  When implemented, these efforts will enable DoD aircraft to take advantage of new technologies and operational capabilities, to enhance safety, security, efficiency, affordability, and flight operations.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the ATCALS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

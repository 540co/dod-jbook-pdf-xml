DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations\n\nFE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE):\nMilitary Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial & International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.\n\nFE4 \/ Enroute Mission Command:  \nMission Description and Budget Item Justification:\nEnroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective. The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.\n\nDue to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018\/2019, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku FISA FOC (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC."

Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future."

MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial & International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.\n\nFY 2019 funds support the continued systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM Communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). In addition, FY 2019 funding covers the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) Modem Testing, Narrowband Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD), Network Centric Waveform Tool (NCWT) Development and Testing, Network Centric Waveform - Resilient (NCW-R) engineering support and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations."

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) provides funding for analytical support of Analysis of Alternatives. Analyses of Alternatives are statutory requirements for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and regulatory for all other programs. Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, Analyses of Alternatives are required to be completed for a new start program prior to its first Milestone Decision. The PE provides analytical capability for Pre-Milestone A programs that emerge outside the normal budget or POM cycles. Normally these programs are without program managers and require analysis to support Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leader's requirement and acquisition needs and priorities. The Analyses of Alternatives support the preparation of the Capability Development Document, Key Performance Parameters and Thresholds values and tradeoff analysis. The cited work is consistent with the Army Futures Command Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Guidance. Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as The Research and Analysis Center and Data and Analysis Center. The Army is projecting to start work on multiple Analyses of Alternatives beginning in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21), and will assess and fund the highest Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leader's priorities during the year of execution."

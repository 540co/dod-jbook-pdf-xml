The purpose of this Program Element's (PE) funding is to integrate the next generation of technology enabled capabilities developed in the Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio and Industry to demonstrate new capabilities to meet emerging military needs, provide hardware for Soldier operational experiment\/feedback, and determine integration potential across the current Army portfolio of ground vehicles. The primary efforts include but not limited to, maturing and experimenting with Manned Un-Manned Teaming, in conjunction with the Robotic Combat Vehicle, maturing, integrating and experimenting with a variety of technologies for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), and other legacy combat vehicles\/platforms within the Maneuver portfolio.  \n\nArmored System Modernization allows for aggressive innovation that could provide a bridge from S&T investment to vehicle integration and operational use. It can inform requirements through User Evaluations, mitigate capability gaps and reduce integration risks. The strategy will be to focus on delivering incremental experimental prototypes to the warfighter to demonstrate Manned Un-Manned Teaming (MUM-T), to integrate technologies to maintain overmatch while demonstrating crew task reductions through crew augmentation enabled by optimized Warfighter Machine Interface (WMI) and sensor fusion. The funding will support virtual and physical concept development, trade studies, technical and operational analyses to assess future concepts and designs. This effort will partner government organic capabilities and Industry for an iterative process to develop combat vehicle concepts and prototypes in order to inform and stabilize future capability requirements, performance characteristics, and affordability, evaluate and update operational concepts, and reduce future acquisition risk. This would also include the support for survivability and lethality requirements\/qualifications. In addition, this funding will support program management, system integration labs, technology maturation, integration risk reduction, qualification of key lethality\/weapon system and sensor technologies to support current and future increments of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), and other legacy combat vehicles\/platforms within the Maneuver portfolio."

Continued to conduct soldier-in-the-loop virtual simulations of future combat vehicle concepts to assess next generation capabilities and conduct system level performance trades. Analyzed system concepts and designs to identify long-lead hardware in preparation for procurement prior to system build and physical integration.

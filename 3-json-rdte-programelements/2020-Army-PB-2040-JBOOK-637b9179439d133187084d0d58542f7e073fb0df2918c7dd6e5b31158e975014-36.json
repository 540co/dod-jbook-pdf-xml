AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 provides Army leaders: Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and Coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management."

AJaSC2 is a software only implementation of strategic applications and interoperability services that leverage the unified software architecture design (core infrastructure and selected common applications being implemented in the CPCE) that provides Army leaders:  Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management. Capability Packages enabled by AJaSC2 are providing Force Employment, Joint Force Synchronization, and Total Force Analysis.  The operational payoff providing the Joint Force Commander a linkage between Army Mission Command and Unified Action Partners, enabling Unified Action through integration with existing and future applications (including CPCE and MCE) and contributes to achieving Shared Understanding during Unified Land Operations (ULO) facilitating effective Mission Command."

The AMCUA CDP provides an overarching structure for future Army Mission Command systems. The AMCUA initiative will meet the requirements to enable planning and share situational awareness within an interdependent enterprise services network comprised of Unified Action Partners (UAP) and sister service components to achieve integrated mission operations. The AMCUA CDP defines the Land Component-unique Mission Command (MC) capabilities that the Army will develop to enable unified action through integration with existing and future Joint and Service command and control applications. MC capability contributions will enable Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) Commanders to gain and maintain Situational Awareness (SA), make decisions, and exercise authority and direction via a flexible, distributive and seamless system.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for AJaSC2 consists of the development, testing and fielding of Capability Packages implemented over time and synchronized with Command Post Computing Environment infrastructure. AJaSC2 will utilize the \"Information Technology (IT) Box\" construct. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue as defined Capability Packages to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box. AJaSC2 strategy will consist of agile application development which will utilize and leverage existing and emerging technologies from Programs of Record and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure. The product development under this R-Form will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on development efforts."

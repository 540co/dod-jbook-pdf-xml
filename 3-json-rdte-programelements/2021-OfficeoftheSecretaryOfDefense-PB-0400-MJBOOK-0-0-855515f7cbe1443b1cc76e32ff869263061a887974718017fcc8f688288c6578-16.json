This funding line was established in FY 2018 from transferred funds from PE 0603289D8Z \/ Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts, to be used for MHA related endeavors.  In a partnership endeavor across the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Services, the Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies, SCO combines capability innovation with new concepts for warfighting that leverage new technology areas, including autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  SCO conducts projects on accelerated timelines, in all warfighting domains, at any classification or access level.\n\nThe Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts -MHA Program Element supports development, studies, analysis, and demonstration of integrated concepts and prototypes, analysis in support of ongoing efforts to shape and counter emerging threats, cross-Service and cross-Defense\/Intelligence concepts, and red-teaming. Projects focus on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major systems, and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level."

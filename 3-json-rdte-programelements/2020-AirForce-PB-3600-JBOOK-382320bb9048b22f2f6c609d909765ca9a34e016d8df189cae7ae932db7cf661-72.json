SSI funds developmental intelligence activities to support new space superiority capability acquisition and development. Funds associated developmental ISR planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, dissemination and integration (PCPAD) capabilities providing Battlespace Awareness and SSA in support of Space Superiority and Space Control. This includes funding for fixed and transportable intelligence collection, processing\/exploitation and dissemination (PED), analysis and production capabilities that are modular (plug-and-play), meet Risk Management Framework Accreditation requirements and can keep pace with technological advances and emerging threats. It provides intelligence support systems for Space Situational Awareness activities that provide the requisite current and predictive knowledge of space events and threat conditions and intelligence support to Space Protection Programs by providing architectural survivability analysis of critical mission assets for mission assurance, as well as network analysis. It also supports specialized\/tailored, phased threat system analysis and studies (A&S), test support, lab equipment, and Material Acquisition and Exploitation (MAE) for system development, vulnerability, susceptibility assessments to support tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and future threat technology studies necessary for mission area success and achievement of space superiority, and to preserve the US space advantage across all domains. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SSI capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $2.088 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

            "val": "Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A): This project is the Army component system that directly supports the implementation of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems. GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools for Army Strategic and Operational Theater Commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during joint and combined operations in support of National Security. The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A was re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services (BCCS)\/Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and Mission Command Workstation. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.\n \nArmy Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 provides Army leaders: Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and Coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management.\n\nFiscal Year 2018 Base funding in the amount of $0.316 million supports GCCS-A 4.3 software updates and Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) testing of the GCCS-A Bridge Effort in conjunction with Common Operating Environment. Certification testing ensures that GCCS-A Bridge Effort software is successfully configured as a virtual machine on BCCS\/TSI and is interoperable with Army and Joint Mission Command Systems.\n\nFiscal Year 2018 base funding in the amount of $5.712 million will support the Army\u2019s capability for unit readiness reporting, unit registration and force planning and projection activities to enable Title 10 reporting to Congress.  Specifically the funding will provide program and acquisition oversight, technical development and training support to enable the readiness and force projection capabilities."

(1) A Bridge effort, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III level and (2) a Modernization development effort for the Army's Joint and Strategic command and Control capabilities infrastructure software products. The GCCS-A modernization development effort will be in compliance with Joint Command and Control Capability Development Document (JC2 CDD) and Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). DRRS-A will continue to satisfy readiness reporting requirements from Army Readiness Division (DAMO-ODR). The Bridge Effort's acquisition approach consists of a support agreement with CECOM LCMC SEC as the prime software developer utilizing a mix of government and contractor support.\n\nThe product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command System of Systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity to improve readiness among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems."

AJaSC2 is a software only implementation of strategic applications and interoperability services that leverage the unified software architecture design (core infrastructure and selected common applications being implemented in the CPCE) that provides Army leaders:  Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management. Capability Packages enabled by AJaSC2 are providing Force Employment, Joint Force Synchronization, and Total Force Analysis.  The operational payoff providing the Joint Force Commander a linkage between Army Mission Command and Unified Action Partners, enabling Unified Action through integration with existing and future applications (including CPCE and MCE) and contributes to achieving Shared Understanding during Unified Land Operations (ULO) facilitating effective Mission Command. \n\nCurrent plan for Fiscal Year 2017 funding is to utilize 853K to support initial development design of Capability Packages. Fiscal Year 2018 base funding supports program level pre-Material Development Decision (MDD) activities including final design efforts, documentation required by policy and regulation, research and analysis, and Joint requirements validation process."

The AMCUA CDP provides an overarching structure for future Army Mission Command systems. The AMCUA initiative will meet the requirements to enable planning and share situational awareness within an interdependent enterprise services network comprised of Unified Action Partners (UAP) and sister service components to achieve integrated mission operations. The AMCUA CDP defines the Land Component-unique Mission Command (MC) capabilities that the Army will develop to enable unified action through integration with existing and future Joint and Service command and control applications. MC capability contributions will enable Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) Commanders to gain and maintain Situational Awareness (SA), make decisions, and exercise authority and direction via a flexible, distributive and seamless system.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for AJaSC2 consists of the development, testing and fielding of Capability Packages implemented over time and synchronized with Command Post Computing Environment infrastructure. AJaSC2 will utilize the \"Information Technology (IT) Box\" construct. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue as defined Capability Packages to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box. AJaSC2 strategy will consist of agile application development which will utilize and leverage existing and emerging technologies from Programs of Record and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure. The product development under this R-Form will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on development efforts."

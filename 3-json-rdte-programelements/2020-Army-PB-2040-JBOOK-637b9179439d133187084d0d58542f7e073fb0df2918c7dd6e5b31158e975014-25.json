            "val": "The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, ground-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle. The Avenger's mission is to protect fixed critical assets and Corps\/Echelons above Corps Maneuver forces from Fixed Wing (FW) Aircraft, Rotary Wing (RW) Aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles (CM). Avenger provides day\/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability.\n\nThe Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) consists of Project 038: Avenger Production Improvement Program (PIP) and Program Element CE8710: Avenger MODS. FY 2020 funding of $1.287 million ensures that Avenger is viable and sustainable through the end of program life. Avenger MOD-SLEP maintains operational capability of Avenger until FY 2031.  \n\nThe Stinger missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, shoulder-fired and platform mounted guided missile that provides the maneuver force and point defense assets air defense protection. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against FW, RW, UAS and CM. The Stinger missile is deployable from a variety of platforms that includes vehicles, helicopters, UAS and Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS). The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.\n\nStinger Product Improvement completes the design, development, test and integration of the Proximity Fuze (PROX) and addresses obsolescence. This will make PROX available for incorporation into the existing Stinger Block I missile. The PROX will improve effectiveness by eliminating the need for a hit-to-kill against UAS threats. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3\/5\/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.\n\nStinger Product Improvement also includes the following efforts: redesign of Stinger missile components to address obsolescence and improve performance; integration of the Javelin Lightweight Command Launch Unit (CLU) onto the Stinger MANPADS to improve target acquisition capabilities; and redesign of Stinger Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) to address obsolescence."

Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against Fixed Wing (FW) and Rotary Wing (RW) Aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles (CM). The Stinger missile is deployable from a variety of platforms that includes vehicles, helicopters, UAS and Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS). The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.\n\nStinger Product Improvement completes the design, development, test and integration of the Proximity Fuze (PROX) and addresses obsolescence. This will make PROX available for incorporation into the existing Stinger Block I missile. The PROX will improve effectiveness by eliminating the need for a hit-to-kill against UAS threats. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3\/5\/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.\n\nStinger Product Improvement also provides for the following efforts: redesign of Stinger missile components to address obsolescence and improve performance; integration of the Javelin Lightweight Command Launch Unit (CLU) with the Stinger MANPADS to improve target acquisition capabilities; and redesign of Stinger Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS)  to address obsolescence.\n\nStinger Product Improvement does not have FY 2020 funding."

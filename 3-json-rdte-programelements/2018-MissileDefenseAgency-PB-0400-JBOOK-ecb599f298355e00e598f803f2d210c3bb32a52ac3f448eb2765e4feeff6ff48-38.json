DoD efforts to establish a common MHA framework resulted in a net funding decrease due to the transfer of civilian manpower performing functions MDA considered MHA in prior years.  Funding and civilian manpower performing these non-MHA functions were appropriately transferred to Program Wide Support.  Implementation of prior year efficiencies also continues in FY 2018.\n\nReduced funds and manpower to implement additional management headquarters civilian reductions to meet 25% reduction level by FY20."

This program element funds government civilian salaries and benefit, travel, contract support services, facility and logistics support functions, transportation subsidies, security and emergency management, and operations of non-fielded activities.\n\nManagement Headquarter Activities provide executive leadership planning, develop centralized agency policy, prepare and defend annual budget submissions, respond to external inquiries, and implement SECDEF and Presidential priorities.  As a DoD research, development and acquisition agency, the Headquarter Activities provide cost efficient oversight; direction; and control of initiatives and processes that assure best value, high quality, on-time and successful performance of MDA acquisition programs.  This is accomplished by ensuring acquisition and procurement program management emphasizes systems engineering; incorporates  life cycle management objectives; implements risk management; and assesses cost, schedule or performance trade-offs."

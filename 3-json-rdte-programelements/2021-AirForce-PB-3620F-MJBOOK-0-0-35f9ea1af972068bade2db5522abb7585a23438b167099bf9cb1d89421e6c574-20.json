Includes development, demonstration and delivery of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems. Provides a safe, secure, controllable and repeatable environment for the testing of space control mission systems and training operators in both realistic and relevant environments. Additionally, using an agile incremental development approach for range capabilities, this program develops test range assets for both the fixed node Space Range Operations Center (SROC) at Schriever Air Force Base and a deployable Signal Monitoring Unit capability to support complex Joint and AF exercises. The virtual range as part of the Family of Systems (FoS), called Advanced Threat Simulation Environment (ATSE) virtual range, is being developed to accomplish the STTR mission. ATSE integrates to a Distributed Mission Architecture, tying into cyber, air, and space ranges for increased realism and complexity required to prepare space operators for real-world threats. This technology will allow for the first-ever use of a realistic signal environment to increase the realism and efficiency of space control squadron training. Additionally, the STTR Next Space Orbital Engagement (OE) range risk reduction projects will analyze, prototype, and demonstrate potential range systems that are used to support the testing and training of new advanced development space systems, advanced training for space operator orbital engagement maneuvers and future exercises. These risk reduction activities will include on-orbit capabilities, ground components, communication between nodes, and other required infrastructure.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n          \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver STTR weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n          \nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

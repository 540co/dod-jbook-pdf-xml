Overarching program goals include enhanced warfighter lethality, modernization of cross-cutting technology areas, and delivering capabilities more quickly than traditional acquisition.\n\nRPP develops prototypes that deliver needed capabilities to address Service gaps, reduce technical and integration risk, and enable warfighter feedback to define and improve requirements for Service and Agency programs of record.  RPP project selection is guided by the National Defense Strategy, USD(R&E) priorities, and key technology modernization areas including machine learning; directed energy, networked command, control, and communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), advanced autonomous systems, and, joint lethality.  RPP is also guided by the Chairman\u2019s Capability Gap Assessment, and Service-identified gaps and needs.  RPP rapidly develops and fields cross-cutting, multi-Service prototype capabilities that can be demonstrated in an operational environment to inform Department of Defense and Service leadership."

The prototype detection capability was integrated via rapid technology insertion with the Army\u2019s Long Range Advance Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3).  The project developed four prototype detection systems for test and validation.  The prototypes leveraged partners from the Army Rapid Capabilities Office and the Army Product Manager Ground Soldier Systems.  Using FY 2018 funding, the project initiated development, integration, and testing of the system hardware and software.  Transition partner funding will support an initial assessment in FY 2020 and a final military utility assessment (MUA) in FY 2021.  Following a successful MUA, the systems will be transitioned to the Army LRAS3 program of record, and will inform the Next Generation Combat Vehicle."

The prototype is a gun-hardened, low-cost seeker technology that significantly improves accuracy and enables critical multi-mission capability.  Multiple seeker technologies for small agile interceptors were integrated and tested using a government developed and built projectiles.  The prototype built on work completed in the Office of Naval Research and the Strategic Capabilities Office.  FY 2018 funds completed development and testing to support a final flight test with a subsequent transition to a new acquisition program in the Navy."

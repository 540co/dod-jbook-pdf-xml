            "val": "This program element (PE) provides for development and testing of general-purpose test equipment, state-of-the-art diagnostics and prognostics technologies, and software and systems to support the increasingly complex electronic components of the Army's new and upgraded weapon systems.  It focuses on implementation of commercial test and diagnostic technologies across multiple weapon platforms to minimize the cost of troubleshooting and maintenance of Army equipment in the field.  Funding supports modernization of the test equipment fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to, condition-based maintenance, instrument reduction\/miniaturization, electro-optics (EO), radio frequency (RF), and other emerging technologies.  Funding also supports development of initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and testing capabilities required for emerging weapons platforms. \n\nModular, reconfigurable automatic and semi-automatic systems are being developed under this program to satisfy weapon system test and diagnostics requirements.  The Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS) provides state-of-the-art test and diagnostic capabilities to support current and future weapon systems.  It is the platform for transitioning Agile Rapid Global Combat Support System (ARGCS) technologies into the Army weapon system support structure, and it will replace several aging automatic test systems (ATS) that are becoming prohibitively expensive to operate and maintain.  \n\nThis PE also provides for continued development and improvement of general-purpose test equipment and calibration standards with emphasis on the incorporation of digital electronics and tailoring of configurations to improve deployability, mobility and survivability of the support equipment.  It includes development, demonstration and testing of calibration standards and techniques to support new Army test equipment requirements; and, it provides for feasibility studies, market research, inventory analyses, bid sample testing and prototyping to support acquisition of calibration systems and general-purpose test and diagnostics equipment. \n\nFY 2021 Base funding for this PE continues incremental development of the Army's standard NGATS which will improve deployability and mobility of test and diagnostic equipment.  The NGATS provides state-of-the-art test and diagnostic capabilities and a means for reducing the Army's test equipment operating and support costs and the costs for supporting a number of the Army's vital warfighting systems.  The FY 2021 funding will develop or significantly modify test equipment to satisfy modular force and homeland security support requirements that cannot be accommodated with test equipment currently available in the commercial marketplace such as RF and EO testing capability.  It will also provide for technology insertions to modernize the Army's standard at-system tester to meet test and diagnostic requirements of the supported weapon systems, develop\/redesign test program sets and hardware for support of legacy and emerging weapon systems, develop a network centric software framework for NGATS, and develop and test general-purpose test equipment and calibration standards to meet Army weapon system support requirements."

The NGATS is a general-purpose automatic test system (ATS) that provides test and diagnostic capabilities required to support current and future weapons and combat support systems and will facilitate retirement of aging and obsolete test equipment that is imposing increasing logistics and operations and support cost burdens.  It is the platform for transitioning Agile Rapid Global Combat Support System (ARGCS) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) technologies into the Army weapon system support structure.  The ARGCS ACTD initiative was sponsored by the Department of Defense, and all Services are expected to transition demonstrated technologies into their ATS programs.  The MSD is the Army's standard at-system tester and requires continuing technology insertions to support modernization of the supported weapon systems.  This Project funds development efforts to insert the most current relevant technology into the next generation MSD, supports capability enhancement of wireless at-platform test set (WATS) connectivity, develops capabilities to minimize or eliminate Army dependency on expensive proprietary software to support tactical vehicles, and maintains compatibility with emerging platform hardware bus technology and software interface requirements.  This Project also provides for continuing efforts in the development and testing of common procedures utilizing existing test program sets and software applications, and market surveys of commercially available test equipment, methods and procedures to determine applicability to Army requirements.  The test and diagnostic systems and procedures developed under this Project are essential for ensuring the operational readiness, accuracy and effectiveness of the Army's warfighting systems."

Funding also supports development of initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future calibration systems and general-purpose test, measurement and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) acquisitions.  This Project develops calibration software and calibration capability for electro-optical, chemical, biological agent, radiation sourcing and detection systems, signal measurement from direct current to microwave ranges, physical and mechanical measurements such as torque, pressure, and temperature, and improvements in test and measurement performance envelopes.  It provides for product improvements and development\/evaluation of advanced technologies to increase reliability of calibration systems and general-purpose TMDE.  The product improvements eliminate gaps in existing organic capabilities and ensure operational readiness and safety of Army weapons and combat support systems.  These improvements employ reconfigurable open-electronics architecture and computer-based instrumentation where feasible and focus on reduced test equipment footprints to improve deployability and mobility in areas of operation."

FY 2016 assessment, analysis and integration initiatives were focused on: Joint C2 Capability Development, Mission Partner Environment (MPE)\/NATO\/Multinational Engagement, Joint Fires Combat Identification, Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems, Data and Services Standards, and Cyber Capability Development.  The most important projects included:\n\n(1)\tFriendly Force Tracking (FFT) Ground to Air (G2A) Situational Assessment \u2013 Conducted an operational assessment of US and Coalition partner ground to air situational awareness systems.  Validated that the systems received correct information data, processed a high volume of data, and the data management\/processing capability correctly sorted track data to reduce risk of fratricide.\n\n(2)\tJoint Operational Long Term Evolution Deployable (JOLTED) Tactical Cellular System (TACTICS) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Technical Manager \u2013 JOLTED TACTICS is an Internet Protocol (IP) based system designed to provide secure cellular communications to tactical users at much higher data rates than other tactical networks.  This system leverages innovations in Fourth Generation (4G) LTE Cellular technologies and mobile Ka band spread spectrum satellite communications to deliver megabits of data to mobile and dismounted teams armed with mobile devices such as smartphones or netbooks.   As the JCTD Technical Manager C4AD conducted the operational assessments to prove the system's validity.  The successful JCTD resulted in transition agreements to field the system being executed with PM WIN-T, NAVAIR, and PdM Nett Warrior as program managers. \n\n(3)\tAir Operation Center (AOC) and Joint Operations Center (JOC) C2 Information Systems (C2IS) Capability Integrations (six (6) events) \u2013 Provided a persistent operational cyber environment to USPACOM where Blue Teams and Red Teams interacted with operational command and control systems and networks.\n\n(4)\tAutomated NATO Database Interface Interoperability Assessments \u2013 Assessed the automated exchange of targeting data between the US Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT) and the NATO Joint Targeting System (JTS) which enables faster joint and coalition targeting by automating the transfer of targeting data, reducing manpower requirements, and data entry errors.\n\n(5)\tC17 Hatch Mount Satellite Antenna (HMSA) Operational Assessment \u2013 The C-17 HMSA provided enhanced bandwidth to support on-board mission commander\u2019s requirement for communications capable of enroute mission planning during forcible entry operations.  The successful operational assessment resulted in operational commanders recommending that the system be fielded, but there has not yet been a fielding decision.\n\n(6)\tCommercial Solutions for Classified (CSFC)\/Secure Wireless Local Area Network (SWLAN) Integration Assessments - Assisted the National Security Agency in the development, assessment, and fixed site deployment of a Suite B software encryption solution. This capability supports communicating over classified wireless networks without encryption hardware.\n\n(7)\tCoalition Warrior Interoperability Exercise 2016 (CWIX16) \u2013 Supported the technical validation of eleven (11) Federated Mission Networking (FMN) specifications, participating countries use of them, and the interoperability of these networked services in a federated environment.  Conducted an assessment of FMN Spiral Specifications as an extension of CIAV and related them to US Mission Partner Environment (MPE) networking.\n\n(8)\tExecutive Command and Control-Generation Next (EC2 GenNext) Data at Rest Technical Solution \u2013 Provided Senior Leadership with an e-reader solution that uses a Windows Surface Pro tablet running an NSA approved data at rest security solution.  The capability provides Executive\/Senior Leaders with access to classified material on a device that is NSA approved secure and unclassified when powered down.\n\n(9)\tDistributed Assured and Dynamic Configuration (DADC) Support \u2013 Assessed DADC\u2019s capability to detect\/repair equipment misconfigurations and C2 system\u2019s version incompatibilities to optimize network performance in USPACOM.    \n                                                               \n(10)\tUSPACOM Targeting and ISR Interoperability Assessment \u2013 Conducted an initial PACOM HQ and Service\/Coalition assessment of joint targeting and command\/decision systems. \n\n(11)\tBlack Dart \u2013 Led data collection and analysis on the integration of counter-UAS (C-UAS) operational architectures, operational concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) during BLACK DART event.  Evaluated current and proposed operational concepts for C-UAS operations, providing recommendations based on qualitative\/quantitative findings to stakeholders.  Supported organizations include JS, all Services, Combatant Commands, DHS, and select U.S. and foreign acquisition programs (both fielded & emerging technologies).\n\n(12)\tSquad-X \u2013 Provided quantitative\/qualitative data collection and analysis to baseline current U.S. small unit mission command technologies in support of DARPA\u2019s Squad-X project.  This baseline objectively describes the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of current capabilities, as well as their interoperability with current\/future Mission Partner Environments.  Technologies injected in follow-on phases of the project will be measured against this baseline, supporting future development and procurement decisions based on measurable improvements in effectiveness and interoperability. \n\n(13)\tCAS JT&E \u2013 Leading DOT&E effort for Digitally-Aided Close Air Support (DACAS) Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) Standardization development. The nomination, endorsed by all Services and USSOCOM, resulted in implementation of the DACAS TTP Standardization Joint Test with Joint Deployable Analysis Team (JDAT) tasked to direct and support these efforts.\n\n(14)\tBold Quest Technical Demonstration \u2013 Designed, built, accredited, and managed the Bold Quest exercise networks for US and coalition partners.  Enabled actions include establishment of transport nodes, institution of quality of service policies, cross domain services, sustainment of network core services, data collection from remote and field nodes, Voice over IP services, joining procedures, and all required documentation.\n\n(15)\tBOLD Quest Exercise Analysis \u2013 Conducted evaluations of demonstrated Joint\/Coalition capabilities, resulting in detailed analysis of interoperability gaps and integration shortfalls relating to the following:  Joint Fires Capabilities, Coalition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (CISR), Digitally Aided Close Air Support (DACAS), and Joint Close Air Support (JCAS).  Results inform U.S. Joint, all Services, and Coalition (to include NATO) partner decisions to field interoperable and integrated capabilities."

A comprehensive Joint Task Force (JTF) environment will support the integration and operational assessment process and support cyber training, capability development and assessments, separately and in coordination with the Department of Defense Cyber Range Environment (DECRE). This is achieved by maintaining a persistent C5 laboratory environment that allows for a rapidly reconfigurable joint, coalition, and inter-agency interoperability assessments, including participation in the Coalition Interoperability and Assurance Validation (CIAV) which supports on-going war efforts. In a live setting, a deployable capability allows the collection and analysis of decision quality data for command and control operations from the operational to lowest tactical echelons of command.  This objective, joint analysis supports capability development, acquisition, and systems employment decisions based on quantifiable performance in replicated operational environments.  FY 2018 focus areas include: Capability development in Command and Control, Mission Partner Environment (Federated and Virtual), Joint Fires Support, and operations in Cyberspace, plus Joint Test and Evaluation of Digitally Aided Close Air Support (DACAS). C5 Assessments and Analyses activities are conducted through both: persistent, reconfigurable C5 laboratories that connect joint and coalition system of systems operational environments to other virtual, constructive, and live environments across national and multi-national operational, research, and test networks leveraging operational venues\/exercises; and, a deployable assessment capability (including contested joint environments) that allows range instrumentation and the collection and analysis of quantitative data in replicated operational environments. \n\n Projects include:\n\n(1)\tCoalition Interoperability Assurance Validation (CIAV) Assessments \u2013 Conduct interoperability assessments of coalition systems supporting coalition mission threads.

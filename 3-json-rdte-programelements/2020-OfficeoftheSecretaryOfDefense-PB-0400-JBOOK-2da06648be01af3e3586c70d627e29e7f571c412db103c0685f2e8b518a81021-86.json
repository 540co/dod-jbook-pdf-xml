The IBAS Program provides the Department with a unique capability to achieve the strategic goals within the 2018 National Defense Strategy for a strong, resilient, responsive and healthy US Industrial Base (IB) that improves the Departments force readiness posture.  This program is uniquely positioned to improve the US Industrial Base\u2019s competitiveness and ability to respond to the Departments needs by applying focused investments to: 1) monitor and assess the current state of the IB, 2) address critical issues in the IB relating to Urgent Operational Needs, 3) address supply chain vulnerabilities and, 4) support efforts to expand the Industrial Base.\n\nManufacturing dominance underpins technical dominance. A healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base and resilient supply chains are essential to the economic strength and national security of the United States.  The ability of the United States to maintain readiness, and to surge and sustain in response to an emergency, directly relates to the capacity, capabilities, and resiliency of our manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains. \n\nIBAS is fundamental to achieving a modern IB that integrates traditional and emerging sectors to be able to respond at will to National Security Requirements. \n\nIBAS investments focus on addressing Industrial Base issues that support defense needs by identifying and closing gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and creating and sustaining reliable sources. Key areas of IBAS investment will include:\n1) advancing and sustaining both traditional and emerging defense manufacturing sectors, \n2) preserving critical and unique manufacturing and design skills, \n3) supporting and expanding reliable sources, and \n4) identifying and mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities"

INDPOL collaborates with the services and agencies in performing assessments under the Title 10 USC Section 2505 program to identify elements of the industrial base critical to a healthy and resilient defense industrial base:\n\n1) Gaps in national-security-related domestic manufacturing capabilities\n2) Threatened, single, or sole source capabilities especially within the lower tiers\n3) Foreign Dependency from high risk sources or countries\n4) Education and manufacturing workforce skills \n\nThe continued corrosion on the industrial base is a direct and severe threat to National Security, especially with the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition of authoritarian peer nations.  \n\nFY 2020 and beyond investment strategies will also be informed by, 1) the findings of Executive Order (EO) 13806, \"Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States,\" and 2) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS). The EO assessment identified nearly 300 risks across 16 sectors; concludes the current state and trajectory of the U.S. industrial base and our capacity to support readiness is in question; and requires significant changes including increased investment for the industrial base.\n\nFindings from the nine traditional defense sectors and seven cross-cutting sectors will be used to inform both product specific investments as well as developing enterprise-wide initiatives to mitigate and capture domestic capabilities. \n\nIBAS investments seek to ameliorate industrial base and manufacturing issues to strengthen the defense industrial base. All projects are evaluated for industrial base risks using fragility and criticality risk criteria, similar to the more familiar probability and consequence risk criteria.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific capability likely to be disrupted.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific capability difficult to replace if disrupted. \n\nIBAS currently focuses efforts and investments in four categories:  Radars, Sensors, and Electronics Sectors; Materials Sector; Munitions and Missiles Sector; and Cross-cutting Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Mitigation.\n\nCornerstone Other Transaction Agreement (OTA): Enhanced efficiency of IBAS program execution will be supported by a new non-Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) OTA procurement vehicle called Cornerstone, established February 2018 in partnership between ODASD (Industrial Policy) and the Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC). Cornerstone was specifically designed for industrial base investments to meet the Departments needs to improve readiness and sustainment through proactive engagement and investment within and across supply chains. Cornerstone provides the ability to access (18) different industry sectors under one agreement where all parties have agreed to one common management agreement and one intellectual property agreement, and it allows the Government to open or direct solicit tasks as legally appropriate against OTA statues. Cornerstone\u2019s period of performance is \u201cin perpetuity\u201d with no overall ceiling, with task award ceilings. IBAS authorities coupled with Cornerstone enable the department to efficiently execute IBAS investments \u2013 positioning the industrial base to modernize at pace with our military."

Investing in casting equipment allows the producer to develop additional skills, which should drive revenue and increase the foundry's utilization rate.  Keeping the U.S. foundry operational is vital to maintaining and protecting domestic production of Navy submarine and surface ship propulsors.\n\nElectron Beam Welding (EBW):\nAlternative electron beam welding (EBW) processes are required to support critical path production timelines for large volume support structures.  EBW enables significant cost, schedule, and quality benefits over traditional, domestically available arc welding technologies.  Currently large volume EBW is only available at a foreign source.  This effort seeks to establish a U.S. capability via a phased approach, which includes: welding process development, small scale prototype demonstrations, acquisition, installation and commissioning of large scale capable equipment, and full-scale prototype demonstration.  EBW will enable the Navy to reduce the time required to produce large scale parts with significantly better repeatability, quality, and reliability, and at a lower cost."

Current materials are either produced at a foreign sole source outside the United States or are no longer in production due to material obsolescence.  These materials represent a high risk to key DoD defense system supply chains.   The purpose of this project is to fund needed evaluation, demonstration, qualification and transition of potential substitute carbon fibers produced from domestically-produced commercial sources of poly-acrylic-nitrile (PAN)-based carbon fibers and therefore mitigate the supply risk of sole foreign and obsolete sources."

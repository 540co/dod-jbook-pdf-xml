Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance\/cyber security, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, commercial mobile devices (CMD), applications and infrastructure, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, and communications (C3) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.\n\n     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C3 capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space, maritime, cyberspace) of the joint information environment (JIE), to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C3 capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse and secure joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission applications, commercial mobile devices, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance and mission assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).\n\n     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint \/Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the DoD Information Network (DODIN) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled DODIN initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.  In support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), rebuilding the warfighting readiness of the Joint Force (Lethality); Net Centricity improves strategic and tactical C2 and Communications, CIO is actively supporting the services to accelerate modernization of Command and Control and Communication (C3) systems.  As outlined in the NDS, the return of great power competition elevates the requirement for the Joint Force to dominate a highly contested conflict.  DoD cannot assume the same robust, uninterrupted, tactical-to-strategic command and control network will remain intact against a peer-level adversary.  Rather than existing across a single domain, these new network paths must leverage space, air, land, surface, sub-surface, and cyber to ensure redundancy against attack.  To build confidence in our communication ability in a contested theater, DoD must make targeted investments that increase communication resiliency.  This resilient architecture leverages multiple waveforms carried across space, air, land, surface, sub-surface and cyber minimizes periods that C2 will be degraded when communicating in a highly contested environment."

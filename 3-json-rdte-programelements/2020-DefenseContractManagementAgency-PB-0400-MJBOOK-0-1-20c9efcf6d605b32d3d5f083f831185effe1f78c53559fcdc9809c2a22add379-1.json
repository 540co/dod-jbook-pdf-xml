            "val": "DCMA is currently engaged in several major initiatives to improve our information technology environment.  Information technology is the primary enabling capability our acquisition workforce is reliant upon to communicate with contractors, the DoD acquisition community and our customers.  These initiatives are driven by the National Defense Strategy business reform line of effort.  On December 21, 2017, the Reform Management Group directed the Information Technology (IT) and Business Systems Reform Lead to review Fourth Estate IT networks, policies, business processes, functions, costs and Chief Information Officer (CIO) organizational structures and manpower requirements across the Fourth Estate.  In support of this directive, DCMA is structuring its information technology investments to be in synchronization with the vision of the DoD guidance. One early result of this review is the decision to transfer commodity information technology administrative control to Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). \n\nDCMA's IT investment strategy is being driven by the Director's initiatives to: 1) Develop Mission Business Systems; 2) Leverage Commodity Buying Power Through DISA; and 3) Focus On The Last Tactical Mile.  These initiatives directly align and support the Optimization and Modernization efforts of the DoD CIO, which include: 1) Network Optimization; 2) Data Center Optimization; 3) Mission Partner Engagement; 4) Defense Travel Modernization ; 5) Enterprise Collaboration; 6) Consolidation of Cyber and IT Responsibilities; 7) Rationalize Business Systems; 8) Streamline IT Commodity Purchasing.\n\nThese initiatives will empower mobile and fixed users ability to utilize DoD enterprise capabilities with the same or better level of efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition, it will create an IT infrastructure that enables shared services and improve timely access to data via cloud capability in a secure and protected integrated environment. The new strategy to move services to the cloud requires research and solution identification to understand and implement a cloud security capability that doesn't currently exist within DCMA."

The JPMO intends to utilize principals of the Federal Segment Architecture Methodology (FSAM) to iteratively modernize the legacy MOCAS core mission, business service, and enterprise service architectures.  In parallel, Single Line of Accounting (SLOA) coding and testing will be completed. The Procurement Defense Standards (PDS)\/Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) data standards will be finalized and fully implemented as well.  Lastly, the JPMO intends to establish a prototyping and testing lab consisting of servers, storage, and networking hardware to evaluate improved MOCAS technical architecture segments in accordance with the approved conceptual design and transition plan.\n\n\n\nIWMS\nThe Integrated Workload Management System (IWMS) will add development and deployment of automated and semi-automated enterprise-wide functionally-integrated contract review, Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) audit management, and contract administration surveillance planning and execution capabilities throughout DCMA and begin development of contract close-out capabilities by 4th QTR FY 2018.\n\nTMS\nIn FY 2018, DCMA\u2019s Talent Management System (TMS) Increment 2B will be deployed to 12,000 plus DCMA users while simultaneously transitioning all data and content off of the old stove piped All Training Frame Work (ATFW) system into the new TMS system.  This Increment addresses needed production updates, simplifies workflows, develops Tag libraries to reduce html clutter, and provides vendor management and travel management capabilities. TMS will be intergraded with the Acquisition Workforce Qualification Initiative (AWQI) focused on on-the-job development for individuals\u2019 needs and the ability to view skill gaps at an organization level allowing for development of mitigation planning for systemic gaps. Increment 2B is scheduled to deploy the end of FY 2018 due to the need to bring on a new contract for further development. DCMA IT will also plan to position TMS as stand-alone infrastructure improving accessibility, security, and performance for DCMA\u2019s fully integrated training system.  \n\nEVAS\nEarned Value Analysis System (EVAS) will continue its partnership with industry to maintain standardized Earned Value (EV) metrics and protocols. EVAS plans to execute a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTs) software configuration and deployment utilizing baseline EV metrics while performing and completing Increments 1, 2, 3, & 4 of configuration and testing. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is scheduled for 2nd QTR FY 2018. IOC consists of the COTS software solution fully configured, tested, and deployed on a DCMA EV Data Analysis laptop with EV automated metrics and protocols available to DCMA Earned Value Management specialists.  EVAS will use the remainder of FY18 to deploy to the EV community\/field throughout DCMA. \n\nAsset and Service Management\nThe DCMA is consolidating this cost category item into a new cost category item entitled \"Business Intelligence Modernization\" which will continue to modernize its Information Technology and Service Management (ITSM) capabilities to fall in line with the NDAA software asset and assurance mandates. In addition, the effort continues to align DCMA\u2019s Information Technology Business intelligence processes and capabilites with systems that can execute Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices . \n\n\n\nSupply Chain Risk Assessment System\nDCMA is consolidating this cost category item into a new cost category item entitled \"Business Intelligence (BI) Modernization\" and will continue development and upgrading for the Supply Chain Risk Assessment System's BI and reporting capabilities for better informed acquisition insight and process improvement.\n\nModifications & Delivery Orders (MDO)\nDCMA is consolidating this cost category item into a new cost category item entitled \"Business Intelligence (BI) Modernization\" MDO and will continue to improve mass modification and related CARs efficiency, further reducing manual contract intervention. Among the planned objectives are Accounting Classification Reference Number (ACRN) functionality improvements, elevated ACO privileges and controls, and Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) CAR data feed improvements. \n\nOther Programs\nDCMA is consolidating this cost category item into a new cost category item entitled \"Business Intelligence (BI) Modernization\" and will continue to support WAWF modifications for industry and infrastructure backbone modernization efforts in support of all DCMA web capabilities.\n\nBusiness Intelligence (BI) Modernization\nDCMA is modernizing and replacing its ageing critical contracting applications with a Business Intelligence enterprise solution which enables end users to analyze multidimensional data interactively from multiple perspectives and data sources both internal and external to DCMA allowing for complex analytical and ad hoc queries with a rapid execution time. This modernization effort would replace critical applications such as Modifications & Delivery Orders (MDO), Contractor Business Analysis Repository (CBAR) , Messaging & Collaboration Services (MCC), Contract Receipt, Review, and Routing System (CRR), Contract Management Property Administration System (CPAS), Enterprise Integrated BI Toolset (EITS) and other applications.  The solution will provide end user self-service customization allowing for the creation and modification of canned and unique dashboards, displays, workspaces, and reporting. Other considerations include online analytical processing (OLAP) which is a broader category of business intelligence which can be used for report writing."

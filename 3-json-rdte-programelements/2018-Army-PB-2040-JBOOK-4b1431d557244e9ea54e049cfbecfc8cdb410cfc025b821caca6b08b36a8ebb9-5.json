            "val": "The Army Concepts Experimentation Program Element (PE) supports current and future concepts and capabilities involving Soldiers and Leaders within live, virtual, and constructive environments by exploring concepts, capability requirements and solution across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) domains in order to learn and mitigate risk for current and future forces.  Experiments and projects inform the Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) will integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.\n\nEnables TRADOC Capability Development and Integration Directorates (CDID)\/TRADOC Capability Managers (TCM) Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development to support Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT) organizational community of PEOs\/PMs supplemented manpower shortfalls to TRADOC for many years. This was necessary to ensure work affecting their materiel development programs, specifically the mandated JCIDS process necessary for Milestone acquisition Army Requirements Oversight Council\/Joint Requirements Oversight Council (AROC\/JROC) decisions, was executed in a timely manner.  Funding ensures TRADOC acts independently as the voice of the warfighter, the user, in complement with the materiel developer in providing total capability management including integration of all DOTMLPF consideration for warfighting functional areas.  Provides for TRADOC to serve as the lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs enabling development and deployment\/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force.  Early Synthetic Prototyping enables wargaming, experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions.  Enables TRADOC to serve as the central coordinating organization for Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) staff support requirements related to accelerated capabilities developments and integrate accelerated capabilities development activities between proponent force modernization domains to include Joint\/Service coordination.  Provides Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA), which will allow TRADOC to physically integrate, assess and evaluate the network, capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. Provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) that are used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration.\n\nThe Soldier-Centered Analysis For Future Force will provide early application of human performance and human figure modeling tools in the development of Soldier-focused requirements to shape technology for Future Force development. Design analyses, constructive simulations and Soldier-in-the loop assessments will ensure that manpower requirements and workload and skill demands are considered to avoid information and physical task overloads, and take optimum advantage of aptitudes, individual and collective training, and numbers of Soldiers for an affordable Future Force."

Empowers participants to explore innovative techniques and participate in equipment and material design options which enables the Maneuver Battle Lab to be innovative in partnering with Department of Defense (DoD) Research and Development organizations in the development of solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges that would be assessed through Army Experimentation assessments.  Leverages design of a high echelon, strategy environment which examines how units organize and employ future capabilities on the battlefield.  The Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) continues, through a distributive network capability to support the Army Level Acquisition Design and merge with the Experimentation Mission while leveraging and sharing the expense of the Battle Labs to interject a new dynamic interactive process into proponent mission to engage Soldiers to select academia and industry solutions into a research opportunity through virtual exploration of the introduced concepts and equipment throughout a simulated operational environment selected from any location in the world.  As Soldiers explore new ideas, concepts, material, and doctrine, they employ new techniques in coordination with the development of requirements documents provide improved insight to environment solutions to techniques and material during the conceptual development stage rather than post construction."

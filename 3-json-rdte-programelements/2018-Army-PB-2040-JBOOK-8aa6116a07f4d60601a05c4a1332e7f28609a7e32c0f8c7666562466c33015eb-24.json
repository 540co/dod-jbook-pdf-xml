            "val": "Horizontal Battlefield Digitization is a strategy that allows warfighters, from the individual soldier and platform to echelons above corps, to share critical situation awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) information. It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities. Digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, are used to provide an operational picture for leaders. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts; between joint and multi-national forces, combat material, and training efforts. 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software from a System of Systems (SOS) perspective. 3) Develop Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) programs into a single integrated system. \n\nDigitization efforts are in support of the Army Equipping Strategy, National Defense Authorization Act 804, and OSD reports to Congress."

Additionally, this program element funds various Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) projects that provide system engineering expertise to provide unbiased advice, formulate course of actions, analyze programs and make technical support and process recommendations to create efficiencies and improve systems.  Specifically, these FFRDC projects support Army Mission Command and network architecture (operational and systems) development, technical and policy document review in support of planning and acquisition, network and joint integration and interoperability evaluations and assessments, program and database analysis, independent technical analysis, special studies, and acquisition process improvement.  In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 804 and support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s (OSD) report to Congress, the Army is poised to implement an incremental approach to software development and hardware\/software capability integration. This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army"

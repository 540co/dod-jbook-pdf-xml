The BCS-F Program is an AF Homeland Defense battle management command and control system with the capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive air picture. BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space. This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression. \n\nBATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM\u2013FIXED MODIFICATION ONE (BCS-F Modification 1). BCS-F Modification 1 effort will implement Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Earth Center Earth Fixed (ECEF) into the BCS-F system.  ADS-B provides the BCS-F system the capability to ingest Global Position System (GPS) based location data at the Air Defense Sectors from ADS-B equipped aircraft.  Implementation of ADS-B on aircraft flying in US airspace is mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by 2020. ECEF is a three-dimensional earth model that eliminates artificial boundaries in the two-dimensional BCS-F stereographic plane. ECEF also allows the ingestion and processing of sensor, target, track, and graphical data without compromising data accuracy due to translation errors.  The BCS-F Modification 1 effort will be executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and Canada.  \n\nIn FY17, BCS-F Modification 1 was a new start. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production."

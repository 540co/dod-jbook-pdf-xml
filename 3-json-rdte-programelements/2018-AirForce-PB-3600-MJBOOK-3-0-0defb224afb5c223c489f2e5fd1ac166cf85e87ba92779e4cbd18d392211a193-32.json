            "val": "Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies and sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and\/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of core technologies can include, but are not limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools can include, but are not limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions. NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (for example Operations Interfaces, Network Controllers, Fusion Engines, Data Guards, Interface to Command & Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO)), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), global web-enabled services, and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.\n\nNCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate dissimilar Joint and Coalition Battle Management, Command & Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms. NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs). Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund the integration of PIMs and associated improvements to core technology software for their respective platform.  Development funds are required for software modifications and necessary for continuous modernization and software technologies associated with automation, data fusion, and information assurance\/cyber security while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  FY 2018 RDT&E funding addresses Air Combat Command's validated requirement for the continuous operation of NCCT within the current tactical battlespace of today as well as development in the Core Technology to provide enhanced capabilities for the strategy of operating in highly contested and Anti-Access environments.\n\nSUTER develops concepts, Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network. Suter's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all Air Operations Centers (AOCs), taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and\/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and IP communications to impact these target sets by \"attacking\" or influencing\/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: Radio Frequency (RF) and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SUTER Concept of Operations (CONOPS) include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC), etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI), all involved \"players\" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment\/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement\/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions. SUTER is the technology that assists Combatant Commanders and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SUTER provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land-based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively. SUTER depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as Modernized Intelligence Database (MIDB), Net-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), Joint Targeting Database (JTDB), Computer Network Operations Database (CNODB), National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) Links and Nodes, and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). SUTER provides a GUI that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives.  FY 2018 funding is dedicated to optimizing the SUTER architecture within a commercial cloud service (C2S) environment and improve machine-to-machine (M2M) data interfaces via several Intelligence Community data sources while updating data models to existing data sources.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Operational uses of core technologies can include, but are not limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools can include, but are not limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions. NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (for example Operations Interfaces, Network Controllers, Fusion Engines, Data Guards, Interface to Command & Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO)), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), global web-enabled services, and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.\n\nNCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate dissimilar Joint and Coalition Battle Management, Command & Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms. NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs). Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund the integration of PIMs and associated improvements to core technology software for their respective platform.  Development funds are required for software modifications and necessary for continuous modernization and software technologies associated with automation, data fusion, and information assurance\/cyber security while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  FY 2018 RDT&E funding addresses Air Combat Command's validated requirement for the continuous operation of NCCT within the current tactical battlespace of today as well as development in the Core Technology to provide enhanced capabilities for the strategy of operating in highly contested and Anti-Access environments.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "SUTER is a project responsible for developing sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and\/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include, but are not limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network are engaged or protected to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions.\n\nSUTER develops technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of network. SUTER's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all Air Operations Centers (AOCs), taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and\/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ machine-to-machine interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) communications to impact these target sets by \"attacking\" or influencing\/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: Radio Frequency (RF) and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SUTER Concept of Operations (CONOPS) include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the use of SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, Joint Information Operations Warfare Command (JIOWC), etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI), all involved \"players\" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment\/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement or ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.\n\nSUTER is the technology that assists Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SUTER provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land-based Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively. SUTER depicts a dynamic, multi-security level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as Modernized Intelligence Database (MIDB), Net-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), Joint Targeting Database (JTDB), Computer Network Operations Database (CNODB), National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) Links and Nodes, and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). SUTER provides a GUI that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting Combatant Commands and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives across the full spectrum of conflict from tactical operations to an Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) strategy. FY 2018 funding is dedicated to optimizing the SUTER architecture within a commercial cloud service (C2S) environment and improve machine-to-machine (M2M) data interfaces via several Intelligence Community data sources while updating data models to existing data sources."

In FY 2017, due to a lack of technical maturity of SUTER's capabilities, the Air Force terminated 645 AESG activities on SUTER and transitioned SUTER program execution responsibilities to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).  645 AESG will transfer FY 2018 SUTER funding to AFRL for execution.  AFRL will increase the technical maturity of the SUTER software and capabilities to a level suitable for eventual transition to an Air Force Program of Record best capable to field, upgrade and sustain SUTER capabilities consistent with warfighter requirements."

            "val": "The Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program addresses Joint and Combatant Commands (CCMDs) warfighting needs through the execution and demonstration of prototypes within two to four years of the identification of a need.  The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes to the field for military utility assessment (MUA) to affordably operationalize technologies that enable warfighters to explore novel concepts and to facilitate informed transition to formal programs of record (PoR) when appropriate.  Based on the results of the assessments, performed under the cognizance of a CCMD sponsor, the products of a JCTD are either \u201cleft behind\u201d for additional assessments or operational use, transition to a PoR, or returned to the technical baseline inventory.\n\nThe key tenets of the program are in alignment with the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering USD(R&E) guiding principles to: shape major technology investments within DoD, focus on joint and cross-cutting missions, prove new concepts of operation, inform and or validate requirements, leverage open systems architectures, and identify accelerated paths to acquisition.    \n\nThe JCTD program achieves this by engaging the interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the Department of Defense's (DoD) access to innovation.  It serves as the vehicle for CCMDs to address Joint strategic priority areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment, which often fall into the seams between the military Services and DoD agencies.  JCTD investments are informed by the CCMDs\u2019 integrated priority list, the capability gaps assessment provided by the Joint Staff, and the Military Services' science and technology roadmaps.\n\nIn FY 2017, the JCTD program successfully completed the MUA and transition of several JCTD prototypes that fielded affordable and sustainable solutions to meet immediate operational needs.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:\n\u2022\tThe JCTD Program has executed 113 JCTDs from FY 2006 to present.  The data shows a transition rate for the program of 81 percent with 52 percent of capabilities transitioning to a PoR, 25 percent to operational fielding, and 4 percent to General Services Administration (GSA) schedule.  The remaining 19 percent were returned to the technical base for further development or were terminated.  Overall, the JCTD program has directly supported multiple key operations while rapidly accelerating game changing technology\/capabilities."

Low Cost Missile Defeat (LCMD) is a ballistic missile defense system designed to counter current and emerging weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threats.  LCMD program execution has been structured using a building block approach; the FY 2015 step was a technology demonstration effort under the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Emerging Capability & Prototyping (DASD (EC&P)) to accelerate technology maturation.  The concept of operations (CONOPS) for the system has been formulated to integrate LCMD into the existing National Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture and will prioritize the use of existing components and systems already fielded.  LCMD is not designed as a replacement to existing BMD systems, but rather as a lower cost complementary\/augmentative component to forward-deployed BMD assets.  The LCMD capability would augment current BMD systems and mitigate threat vulnerabilities to U.S. personnel and strategic assets.  Funding was allocated for participation in the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Low Cost Interceptor Study (LCIS) and risk reduction for key technologies, including the seeker and thrust vane subsystems, modeling and simulation of subsystem design capabilities, and limited prototyping for component flight boards and gimbals.  Results from the LCIS indicated there are more cost effective and viable options for a low cost interceptor.  Accordingly, DoD discontinued the LCMD program and saved the intellectual property and data package for future BMD development efforts.  The LCMD JCTD was closed out in late FY 2017."

The three programs are (1) Unified CCMD Direct Support, (2) JCTD Pre-Transition and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) CCMD Direct Support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project development, demonstration, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling the CCMDs to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  Executes a select number of classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness (SSA) intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance."

Partners involved in SISUDT include U.S. Central Command, U.S. Navy, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Labs (MIT-LL).  The SISUDT Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) is managed by the U.S. Central Command\u2019s Technology Tiger Team to develop a multi-sensor C-UAS to detect, track, and identify UAS in the vicinity of a forward operating base (FOB).  Conducted a six month assessment at a FOB in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.  At the end of the assessment, SISUDT transitioned to U.S. Forces Afghanistan for continued operations."

The existing PoR can acquire, further develop, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.\n-  The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing PoR, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing PoR documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the PoR.\n-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring PoR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  \n-  The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds.\n-  Results of JCTD can be used to inform the research and engineering, acquisition, or requirements process."

In FY 2017, 50 percent of completed JCTDs successfully transitioned and exceeded the DoD Strategic Performance goal of 40 percent.  Two of six completed JCTDs transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record.  One transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  Three were returned to the technology base for further analysis and\/or future use."

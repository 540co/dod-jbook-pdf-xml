            "val": "This program supports Department of Defense (DoD) priorities for demonstrations in hypersonics and manned\/unmanned systems, respectively. This effort integrates and demonstrates advanced flight vehicle technologies that improve the performance and supportability of existing and future aerospace vehicles. System level integration brings together aerospace vehicle technologies along with avionics, propulsion, and weapon systems for demonstration in a near-realistic operational environment.  Integration and technology demonstrations reduce the risk and time required to transition technologies into operational aircraft. Projects in this program have been coordinated through the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

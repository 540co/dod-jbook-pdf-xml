CTTS continues to expand its partnerships with other Defense and Interagency, as well as with our foreign partners\u2019 rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise and prevent duplication as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and interagency users.  CTTS is unique in its approach, annually obtaining joint requirements directly from military and law enforcement operators, intelligence analyst, and first responders.\n\nCTTS recognizes that many of the combating terrorism requirements also support the 2018 National Defense Strategy and will address peer-to-peer high interest areas. These high priority areas include increasing lethal capability of U.S. forces at the squad and small unit level; countering Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (drones) overseas and domestically; tunnel detection and mapping in theater and along the Southwest U.S. border; novel body and vehicle armor; detecting and mitigating novel chemical threats against commercial transportation; telematics; covert communications; and the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  From a broader perspective, projects remain distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytic Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat\/Explosives Countermeasures; Investigative and Forensic Science; Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats; Personnel Protection; Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.\n\nThe CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. It includes technology capability development, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use. CTTS manages approximately 250 individual projects in support of defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. \n\nThe CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, Combating Terrorism Technical Support also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and federal departments and international partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTS has earned throughout the Department of Defense and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products."

The analytical and planning approach is available for use in interagency and allied nation training curriculum. Complete the development of a platform to collect and analyze photographs, videos, audio recordings, and general text-based information via precise crowd sourcing techniques. The technical approach will provide the capability to conduct facial, object and ISIL branded content recognition.  An Android-based application will also be available that can be customized for a specific region, language, and purpose to use for crowd source media collection. Upon completion, the project will immediately enhance the ability of information communicators to collect, search, retrieve, view and analyze photos, audio, and video for use. Complete the transition of the Nightingale effort to deploy digital workflow, approval, and archival processes in support of the CVE mission. This project will provide enhanced coordination, information sharing, and messaging capabilities in support of countering violent extremism. Complete the Western Hemisphere Illicit Pathways effort implementing advanced information exchange tools and training to help build partner nation collaborative capacity among critical U.S. southern borders and approaches. Complete OCONUS operational test and evaluation (OT&E) to provide forward deployed units with access to PAINT. This project will provide teams operating in high threat areas with real-time indications and warnings for blue force protection using social media and other publicly available information (PAI). OT&E will conclude in June 2018. Complete development of an improved capability to conduct multi-layered analysis of the Information Environment using publicly available information and display relevant data and product views in a Common Operating Picture to facilitate Phase 0 planning of Information Environment shaping activities to effectively compete in the environment against state and non-state actors. Complete report that defines the information environment in 2025, outline potential capability gaps, and describe necessary actions in order to gain and maintain information dominance. In addition, this effort will explore information-related capabilities of defense agencies, emerging technologies, and will recommend implementation considerations based on current budget concerns. Upon completion, this project will help prepare the USG for evolving challenges in hybrid-warfare. Complete development of a capability to simultaneously engage populations across numerous modalities such as social media, web, voice, SMS, MMS, and paper-to-digital, in order to reach disconnected populations around the globe. This effort will enable wide-scale two-way communications in a variety of geopolitical environments, to include those areas with and without internet connectivity. Complete development of a database containing relevant foreign criminal statutes\/regulations translated into English and searchable against identified behaviors\/activities. This will enable users to compare and search for relevant foreign criminal statutes\/regulations as well as the willingness\/capability of partner nations to take action against identified threat networks. While this approach will initially focus on violent extremist organizations and their supporting networks, it can be applied across a wide-range of non-State, unconventional, and hybrid threats, to include counter-proliferation networks and transnational criminal organizations. This project will help operationalize law as another non-kinetic tool for commanders. Complete the development and test of an exportable information operations capability that legitimate governments\u2019 can use to counter violent extremist messaging. Conduct testing and evaluation by delivering training and periodic evaluation through the use of mobile advise and assist training teams. Continue a Remote Advise and Assist (RAA) project to examine conditions that would lead to successful RAA operations in a full spectrum environment and then develop and field advanced RAA prototypes in order to test the ability of advisors to continue mentoring partners remotely. By having a robust RAA capability, advisors will be able to significantly enhance time with their partners when physical access is severely restricted. By being able to advise partners in a real time operational environment, the time-period needed to enhance that partner\u2019s capacity can be significantly reduced. Observations will examine how to advance virtual communications between advisors and partners during operations. Continue the development of a tool to support decision makers managing digital operations with some form of predictive advice as to how people will respond to a choice of different types of interventions. In this way, decision-making will be improved not only for planning purposes but also for the development of capability underpinned by a behavioral science evidence base. Continue an effort to manage, enhance, and maintain a SUNet enterprise system that allows the user the ability to detect, monitor, understand, and act in the information environment through mission specific enclaves (partitioned mission or function information cells). Initiate and complete a simplified Full Spectrum Remote Advise and Assist (FS-RAA) project to simplify current RAA prototypes in order to test the ability of advisors to continue mentoring poorly educated and minimally vetted partners. By having a simplified FS-RAA capability, advisors will be able to enhance time with their partners when physical access is severely restricted.  By being able to advise poorly educated and minimally vetted partners in a real time operational environment, the time period needed to enhance that partner\u2019s capacity can be significantly reduced while still protecting advanced tactics, techniques and procedures reserved for closely vetted partners."

The objective of the work in this PE is to develop and mature technologies needed by the Navy and Marine Corps to initiate FNCs in PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development that can be commenced at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, is being resourced in PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development.  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in this PE.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces."

This approach facilitates an optimum response when developing and maturing the technology options that will be developed further in PE 0603673N, Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Tech Div.\nThe FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration. R-2 activities are now organized by the ONR Departments tasked to collaborate with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors. A complete accounting of the technology candidates being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort referenced as continuing in the FY18 plans of this PE will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

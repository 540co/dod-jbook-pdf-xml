            "val": "Tactical Air Control Partys (TACP) are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. TACPs also coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols.  \n\nThe purpose of the TACP-Modernization program is to upgrade TACP voice, data and video communications capabilities, upgrade targeting capabilities, and improve TACP battlefield awareness capabilities. These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Centers (ASOC), Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications.\n\nThe TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in three major categories\/areas:(1) ASCOC\/TOC Systems (used in fixed ASOCs and Army TOCs), (2) Dismounted and Mobile Systems (used by JTACs during infantry operations and vehicle-mounted mobile operations), and (3) Close Air Support System (CASS) software. CASS v1.4.5 software comes in two versions: A) Dismounted version for dismounted mission operations and a B) ASOC, TOC, and Mounted (ATM) version for ASOC, TOC, and Mobile systems.\n\n\nCASS software segment interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F\/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems \/ nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). CASS software will provide advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by Dismounted JTACs, for vehicle-mounted systems, and for stationary systems used in operations centers. Future upgrades necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms will be guided by the TACP CASS Information System Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) approved by the Air Force Requirement Oversight Council (AFROC), Functional Capabilities Board (FCB), and Joint Capabilities Board (JCB). \n\n \nCASS v2.0 provides a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, and targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The architecture includes a Core Module, an HMI module, and an Application Logic module with multiple mission plug-in features. The software is being developed in two versions ASOC\/TOC (A\/T) and Dismounted\/Mounted (D\/M) to support a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN\/PRC-117F, AN\/PRC-117G, AN\/ PRC-148, AN\/PRC-152A, AN\/PRC-154, AN\/PRC-158, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN\/PRC-150C, and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future).  The key characteristic of the software will be the Open System, Modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new external devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and  rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development effort to upgrade systems that have fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Tactical Air Control Party(s) (TACP) are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. TACPs also coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted  operations with Army infantry patrols.  \n\nThe purpose of the TACP-Modernization program is to upgrade TACP voice, data and video communications, targeting, and battlefield awareness capabilities. These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Centers (ASOC), Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications.\n\nThe TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in four major categories\/areas: (1) ASOC\/TOC Systems (used in fixed ASOCs and Army TOCs), (2) Dismounted,(3) Mobile Systems (used by JTACs during infantry operations and vehicle-mounted mobile operations), and (4) the Close Air Support System (CASS) software that resides on and interfaces with the TACP-M hardware systems. CASS software is a Fires centric solution which consists of Close Air Support (CAS) and artillery fire support on the battlefield where digitally aided CASS enables efficient execution of a Joint Terminal Attack Controllers mission tasks utilized on all TACP-M systems.\n\nThe CASS software provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F\/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems \/ nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). CASS software will provide advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by Dismounted JTACs, for vehicle-mounted systems, and for stationary systems used in operations centers. Future upgrades necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms will be guided by the TACP CASS Information System Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) approved by the Air Force Requirement Oversight Council (AFROC), Functional Capabilities Board (FCB), and Joint Capabilities Board (JCB).\n \n CASS v1.4.5 fields critical updates for communicating with CAS aircraft, improves the interface with the Army Tactical Network (ATN), and provides a new Dismounted version for dismounted mission operations.  CASS v2.0 provides a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The new architecture will utilize Windows and Android equipment to provide Data Management, Human-Machine Interface (HMI), and Application Logic software modules with multiple mission plug-in features. The software is being developed in two versions ASOC\/TOC (A\/T) and Dismounted\/Mounted (D\/M) to support a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN\/PRC-117F, AN\/PRC-117G, AN\/ PRC-148, AN\/PRC-152A, AN\/PRC-154, AN\/PRC-158, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN\/PRC-150C, and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future). The key characteristic of the software will be the open system, modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new external devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CASS weapon system capability.The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

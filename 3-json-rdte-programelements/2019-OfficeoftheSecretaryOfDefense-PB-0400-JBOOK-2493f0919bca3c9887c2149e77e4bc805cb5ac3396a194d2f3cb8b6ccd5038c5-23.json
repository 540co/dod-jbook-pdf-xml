It refines strategies and management planning activities that will: (1) provide support to acquisition programs to address trusted and assured microelectronics supply needs; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize hardware assurance as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to the DoD Trusted Foundry program to assure the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics technology.\n\nThis activity will be coordinated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and will include performers from the DoD Components, the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), other DoD and Intelligence Community science and technology (S&T) organizations and laboratories, the defense industry, and the broader commercial industrial base.  It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related S&T activities.  \n\nThis activity implements, maintains, and updates the DoD\u2019s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Additionally this activity places emphasis on incentivizing and proving new microelectronics technology solutions.  Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG."

DoD\u2019s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD\u2019s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) IP from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation in support of microelectronics assurance.\n\nThis program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD\u2019s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will demonstrate advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.  It also demonstrates and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.\n\nAssurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the ability of the U.S. Government (USG) to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project will also support demonstration of a repository of third-party IP and EDA tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.\n\nThis project received additional funding starting in FY 2019 to support microelectronics innovation efforts that both enhance national security as well as the supporting DIB and domestic commercial microelectronics suppliers."

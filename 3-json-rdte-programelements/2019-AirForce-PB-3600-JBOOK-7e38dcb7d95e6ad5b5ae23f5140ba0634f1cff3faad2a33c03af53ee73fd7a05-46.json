This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities. The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to, and in conjunction with, the PSE RDT&E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG). As such this program will obtain, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG-funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG-developed PSE.  In support of PSE, this RDT&E program includes spectrum planning for radio frequency (RF), communication security (cyber), and information assurance requirements.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection Commercial Off The Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control, power, mobility, and defeat effects) which are considered effective for AF physical security use. This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C 3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission. Force Protection programs are inherently subject to rapid changes in the operational environment and will retain sufficient Program flexibility to meet changes in location, scope and capability in order to protect Air Force people, facilities and warfighting assets.       \n\nCounter Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (Cs-UAS) Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) is a rapid acquisition and deployment capability existing of full kill (detect, track, assess and defeat with various capabilities (fixed, mobile, portable and hand-held.) It is a layered system-of-systems using COTS technologies, integrated via GOTS C2 system.\n\nCounter Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (Cs-UAS) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) supports EUCOM JUON to protect specific strategic assets in overseas theaters of operation from the evolution of small unmanned aerial systems based on low cost, extensive proliferation, and availability in the commercial marketplace. This is Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. \n\nCounter Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (Cs-UAS) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON)in support of the Combined Joint Task Force - Operations INHERENT RESOLVE in CENTCOM.

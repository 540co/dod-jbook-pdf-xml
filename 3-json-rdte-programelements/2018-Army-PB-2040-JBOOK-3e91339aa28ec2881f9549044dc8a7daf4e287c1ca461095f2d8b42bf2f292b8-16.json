            "val": "Soldier Robotics Systems for Robotics Development (RD) includes efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, validate materiel solutions, pre-materiel development decision activities in support of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) activities for emerging requirements and programs of record. RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&T) projects, REP initiatives and\/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by individual Soldiers and vehicles. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)), Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Short Range Micro (SRM), Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotics Payload (ERP) and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support AoA that include Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND Corporation studies, and\/or modeling to increase confidence in the materiel solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)\/Capability Production Document (CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations.  This line also covers pre-acquisition activities intended to reduce risk of not fielding capabilities by the required date, such as market surveys, technical risk assessments, initial development of performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test & evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, early test planning activities, and prototype development activities.\n\nThe Battery Modernization & Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier, and to reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB,), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just three. Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological\nupgrades.\n\nRobotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) includes efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, validate materiel solutions and determine initial studies and analyses in support of pre-materiel development decision activities for emerging requirements and programs of record. RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&T) projects, and\/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. Leader\/ Follower (LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Route Clearance & Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Robotic Wingman, etc.) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) that include Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND studies, and\/or modeling to increase confidence in the materiel solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)\/Capability Production Document (CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations. This line also covers pre-acquisition activities intended to reduce risk of not fielding capabilities by the required date, such as market surveys, technical risk assessments, initial development of performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test & evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, early test planning activities, and prototype development activities. Product Manager ALUGS will lead the development of a LF Software Integration Lab (SIL), in addition to Modeling and Simulation (M&S) efforts, to stress the systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements through validated simulations.\n\nLeader Follower will provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. Leader Follower will provide capability for a manned Leader vehicle with up to seven (7) unmanned Follower vehicles.  Initial efforts by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) will control up to three (3) optionally manned Follower vehicles with a designated Leader vehicle. The manned Leader vehicle wirelessly provides direction and speed guidance to the Follower vehicles to follow the Leader vehicle with no driver input or unmanned. The primary purposes for Leader Follower are to improve Force Protection and increase Logistics Throughput. Funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology."

RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&T) projects, and\/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. Leader Follower (LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Route Clearance & Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Robotic Wingman (RW), etc.) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) that include Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND studies, and\/or modeling to increase confidence in the materiel solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)\/Capability Production Document (CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations. This line also covers pre-acquisition activities intended to reduce risk of not fielding capabilities by the required date, such as market surveys, technical risk assessments, initial development of performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test & evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, early test planning activities, and prototype development activities.  The Army Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) will build, and test prototype LF systems for safety release, Soldier use, and further technology maturation. Product Manager ALUGS will lead the development of a LF Software Integration Lab (SIL), in addition to Modeling and Simulation (M&S) efforts, to stress the systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements through validated simulations.\n\nLeader Follower (LF) will provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. Leader Follower will provide capability for a manned Leader vehicle with up to seven (7) unmanned Follower vehicles.  Initial efforts by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center will control up to three (3) optionally manned Follower vehicles with a designated Leader vehicle. The manned Leader vehicle wirelessly provides direction and speed guidance to the Follower vehicles to follow the Leader vehicle with no driver input or unmanned. The primary purposes for Leader Follower are to improve Force Protection and increase Logistics Throughput.

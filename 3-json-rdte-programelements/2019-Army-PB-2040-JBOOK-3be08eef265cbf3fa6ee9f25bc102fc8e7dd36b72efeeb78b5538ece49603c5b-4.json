            "val": "This system is a component of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and will provide for an incrementally fielded Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System\/capability for the composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades.  The Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) element and is a key component to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture via the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.\n\nThe Sentinel currently consists of two primary variants: the enhanced radar variant AN\/MPQ-64A3 system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and the AN\/MPQ-64A3 mounted on a 2.5 ton trailer and towed by an armored Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV) platform to meet force protection and IBCS system requirements. The fielding of the FMTV configuration AN\/MPQ-64A3 assets will be complete in FY19. Sentinel also consists of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command, Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces. The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 kilometers.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.\n\nThe Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization\/upgrades, hardware\/software issue resolution, resolution of obsolescence issues, engineering studies, and cost reduction initiatives.  The funding for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 through FY 2023 development activities addresses the following Sentinel system capability gaps and obsolescence issues identified by the User:  1) Target Detection gap; 2) Target Tracking gap; 3) Net Readiness gap; 4) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) gap; 5) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Defense gap; and 6) Rockets, Artillery & Mortars (RAM) gap. \n\nElectronic Attack\/Electronic Protect (EA\/EP) addresses the electronic countermeasures (ECM) gap.  This effort conducts additional design and testing to verify initial EA\/EP results and updates the database and associated software and hardware with more extensive EA\/EP signatures to address evolving threats. Addresses further EP modifications and methods to be determined based on analysis of results.\n\nSignal Data Processor (SDP)\/North Finding Module (NFM) addresses the Target Detection, Target Tracking, and Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability gaps and funds the mitigation of the SDP and NFM obsolescence issues.   SDP cards are estimated to go obsolete every four to six years. Provides for new SDP kit to address obsolescence issues and allow for additional Electronic Protect capability.\n\nMedium Bandwidth Waveform upgrade will address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  This development effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  This effort will provide better target resolution and more accurate tracking in the slant range coordinate.  This improved target resolution and tracking accuracy will provide improved retention of target identification and more robust tracking that addresses the latent tracking issues.  \n\nMode S upgrade to existing Sentinel Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) will address Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate IFF mode S which is currently not being met.  Mode S transmissions are a key component of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) surveillance technology being used by the Federal Aviation Administration for tracking aircraft as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  In the United States, all aircraft required to have transponders (most aircraft) must transition to Mode S capable units by 2020.  Without the Mode S upgrade, Sentinel will have to rely on these aircraft transponders responding to the legacy mode 3\/A interrogations.  The data available in the Mode S response will be valuable in identifying the aircraft and correlating Sentinel tracks with civil aviation tracks\/data and other track data sources. Develops the Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) software to address the delayed Mode M Global Positioning System (GPS) capability requirement with the new interrogator.\n\nThe Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) (Sentinel A4) is the next generation of radar technology to replace the current phase and frequency scanned array used by Sentinel today.  The AESA Antenna will provide increased capability including extended range for ground-based surveillance and situational awareness, faster and more accurate Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) for clearing fires and preventing fratricide, improved Fire Control (FC) quality track accuracy, and management of larger track loads.  The AESA will also provide improved operation in severe\/urban clutter.  The system will detect and track small targets, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles, in clutter and will detect and track slow targets, such as UAS and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft, at low altitudes in clutter.  The system will detect, track, and classify Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats and will support Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) requirements and can contribute sensor support for mitigating current and future Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 mission requirements.\n\nSentinel System of Systems: Software Development in support of a system of systems architecture (IAMD and IFPC Inc 2-I) for a required simulation capability. The simulation capability will add a high fidelity representation of Sentinel to IAMD to allow for optimum engagement management and mission planning.  Supports Sentinel Digital Simulation Software (SDS\/SENTSIM) development efforts for testing of future capabilities.  Includes software development for Low Slow Small in a test fix test environment as well as integration and testing of the IAMD B kit on board the Sentinel FMTV platform.\n\nAdjunct sensor technology effort will integrate and test a supplemental technology for the Sentinel A3 radar to detect and identify current and emerging threats.  Adjunct sensor technology compliments current radar capabilities to improve system performance and reduces adversaries countermeasure abilities by improving system electronic protect capabilities."

Raytheon owns the Technical Data Package (TDP) for the Sentinel A3 and its predecessors and therefore no other contractor has the technical ability to modify the Sentinel radar or Sentinel software.  The modifications planned for the Sentinel that fall into this category are:  Electronic Attack\/Electronic Protect, Signal Data Processor\/North Finding Module, Medium Bandwidth, and Mode S.  For the Active Electronically Scanned Array, the product office will issue a new contract to develop a modified Sentinel with a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna.\n \nElectronic Attack\/Electronic Protect (EA\/EP) (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to verify the initial EA\/EP Database and update the database, software and hardware with more extensive EA\/EP signatures to address evolving threats.  The updated database will be tested, documented and released for installation.   \n\nSignal Data Processor (SDP)\/North Finding Module (NFM) Obsolescence (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to upgrade and mitigate the Signal Data Processor and North Finding Module issues.  The updated SDP and NFM hardware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.\n\nMedium Bandwidth Waveform (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  The effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  The updated medium bandwidth waveform software and firmware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.\n\nMode S (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to address Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) mode S on board commercial aircraft.  The updated software will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.\n\nActive Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) (Sentinel A4): The Sentinel Product Office will award a new contract to develop the new AESA antenna for integration with the existing Sentinel A3 hardware and software.  The CMDS Product Office will support requirement documentation and conduct design analysis to include analysis of technology, decision review preparation, and contract package development for acquisition of the AESA antenna to upgrade the current Sentinel A3. The software and hardware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.\n\nSentinel System of Systems (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon for risk reduction efforts in the development of the software package to support the identification and engagement of Low Slow Small target sets.  The Sentinel Product Office will work with Other Government Agencies to finalize integration and test of the IAMD B Kit on board the Sentinel platform and to add simulation capability to allow a high fidelity representation of Sentinel to IAMD.\n\nAdjunct Sensor (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will integrate and test a government off the shelf adjunct sensor.  The sensor will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field."

JLTV objectives include increased performance, protection, and payload over the current legacy HMMWV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and reliability.

The U.S. Army is the JLTV service lead.\n\nThe JLTV Program entered the Production and Deployment Phase with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorization on 25 August 2015.  With Milestone C approval, the LRIP fixed price contract was awarded to Oshkosh Defense LLC on 25 August 2015.  This contract consists of a three year LRIP period with options for five additional years of FRP deliveries.  JPO JLTV requested separately priced firm fixed price (FFP) option(s) for purchase of the Technical Data Package (TDP) with appropriate data rights to allow for possible future competition for production vehicles and spares. \n\nDuring the LRIP phase, JPO JLTV will continue to produce production vehicles for extensive Test and Evaluation activities to support a FRP decision.  A ramp up of JLTV quantities will continue thru FY19 to support fielding to U.S. Army and USMC units once the FRP decision is achieved and allow the program to transition into Full Rate production.\n\nThe JLTV program will continually monitor emerging technologies and capabilities through its partnerships with U.S. Army and Marine Corps science and technology organizations as well as through industry market research and partnerships.  At this time follow-on increments for technology insertion are undefined; the JLTV program will look for opportunities to implement increased capabilities throughout the system\u2019s Life Cycle."

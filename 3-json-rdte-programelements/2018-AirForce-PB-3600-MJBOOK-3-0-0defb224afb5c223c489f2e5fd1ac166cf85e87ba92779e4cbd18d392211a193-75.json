Development activities incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current.  Its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

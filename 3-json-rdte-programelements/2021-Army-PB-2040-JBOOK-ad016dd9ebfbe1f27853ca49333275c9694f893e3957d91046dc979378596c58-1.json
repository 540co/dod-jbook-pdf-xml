These funds support event planning, preparation, execution, and close-out.\n\nOverview: \n\nJoint Warfighter Assessment (JWA):\nThese funds provided for Close-out of NIE 18.2; Planned, Prepared, Executed, and Close-out of JWA 19; and provided initial planning for JWA 20.  Planned and prepared for event to occur at Ft Bliss, TX. \n\nPlanning:  \nThese funds supported the development and implementation of horse blanket architecture, conducting design activities for integration of capabilities onto unit vehicles as well as standalone system and network architecture requirements, exercise planning and coordination, to include:\n\nCoordinating, conducting, and analyzing system and system of systems network and non-network specific requirements through use of various information session conducted through the Bull Pen process, Initial Planning Conference, Mid Planning Session and Final Planning Conferences. Information sessions assisted in establishing and confirming JWA requirements with various stakeholders to include multi-national participation to establish and lock network architecture and resource management to ensure successful execution of the various phases associated with JWA 19 being conducted at unit?s home station.  \n\nDevelopment of Unit specific network architecture diagrams through use of various network critical designs reviews with PMs, Vendors, and Unit personnel. Architecture products developed and captured network standards, routing schemes, processes and protocols required to establish, configure and validate the various system and system of system network connections associated with building and maintaining the JWA network. Architecture products allowed positive control of network system configurations to inform and maintain through JWA.   \n\nDeveloping a Validation Exercise (VALEX) plan that configures and checks out the system of systems prior to the exercise; assigning unit locations within the VALEX location; identifying and resolving security and cyber assurance issues associated with running classified and\/ or coalition network operations; validating all Information Assurance Accreditations for networked C4ISR systems, and developing of technical mission threads used to validate the capabilities.\n\nThese funds also supported defining the network system configurations and routing schemes for each event.\n\nPreparation:\nThese funds supported efforts leading up to the execution of the assessment exercise, to include Risk Reductions Events(s), vehicle integration design and build, safety release, and conducting of VALEX.\n\nThe Risk Reduction Events (RRE(s)) efforts were conducted in controlled home station environment (JBLM) to identify and resolve integration, configuration and interoperability issues prior to assessments. RRE1 was the stage sitter for initial network functional testing, routing, and thread testing.  RRE2 was the stage sitter for initial integration of the coalition partner?s networks and the PORs.  The development of technical threads assisted in validating network functionality prior to VALEX and allowed modification of network and routing schemes. \n\nThese funds provided for integration efforts such as design of installation kits on tactical platforms; fabrication of specialized cables, metal plates, racks, and brackets to enable platform installation\/integration; and safety release testing. The scope of the integration effort also included planning for Field Service Representatives (FSRs) and other technical support personnel, coordination and movement of the Fleet vehicles, and inventory management of systems.  Following completion of platform integration efforts, these funds supported a structured network VALEX consisting of four subordinate efforts: Load Exercise (LOADEX), ESTABLISH, INTEGRATE, and VALIDATE.\n\n-LOADEX; Supported unit installation of new network capabilities into existing network, to include setting Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and configure network systems changes; modify radio mission plans, system configuration files and system parameters; and perform test\/fix\/test processes at the system and component levels.\n-ESTABLISH; Verified new hardware and software performance at the platform level. Troubleshot issues associated with network system configurations and verify that each integrated platform can perform its mission while operating on the network.\n-INTEGRATE; Verified network related hardware\/software performance and networked communications at each echelon. Troubleshot issues found with new capabilities and ensured tactical unit information exchange enabled units to support their intended missions.\n-VALIDATE; Supported unit conduct of mission threads to verify the correct routing of messages and information transfer among critical nodes in the network.\n\nExecution:\nFunding supported all management and synchronization of field operations and supported personnel during the events, and coordinated with the supported command. It also included monitoring of network operations in the field, trouble ticket management, deployment of mobile facilities, and replacement parts\/components required to effectively support concepts and capabilities under assessment.\n\nCloseout:\nThese funds supported all activities associated with the de-installation and recovery of systems, components, A-kits, cabling installed on platforms, and restoration of platforms to baseline configurations. Removal, inspection, repair\/replacement, shipping, and storing of all materiel and infrastructure used to enable the unit to execute the event. Conducted AARs for process improvements."

Execution of JWA 20 is expected at Grafenwoehr, Germany with JWA 21 planning expected to occur at Ft Bliss, TX and to be determined location supporting Pacific area.  As the Army Future Command matures, Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate also expects to support planning, preparation, execution, close-out, and assessment of other exercises within the JMC portfolio. \n\nPlanning: These funds support the development and implementation of horse blanket architecture; conducting design activities for integration of capability onto unit platforms; development, engineering, and documentation of network; and exercise planning and coordination, to include: developing a Validation Exercise (VALEX) plan that configures and checks out the system of systems prior to the exercise; assigning unit locations within the VALEX location; identifying and resolving security issues associated with running classified and\/ or coalition network operations; validating all Information Assurance Accreditations for networked C4ISR systems and developing of technical mission threads used to validate the capabilities. \n\nThese funds also support defining the network system configurations and routing schemes for each event.\n\nThese funds support efforts to provide technical input on candidate systems at the Concepts and Capabilities Review Board and Strategic Planning Reviews for future events.\n\nPreparation: \nThese funds support efforts leading up to the execution of the assessment exercise, to include lab based risk reduction (LBRR), platform integration design and build, safety release, and conducting of VALEX.  The LBRR risk reduction efforts are conducted in controlled laboratory environments to identify and resolve integration, configuration and interoperability issues prior to assessments. Reports delivered by the LBRR document the results of network functional testing, routing, and thread testing.\n\nThese funds provide for integration efforts such as design of installation kits on tactical platforms; fabrication of specialized cables, metal plates, racks, and brackets to enable platform installation\/integration; and safety release testing. The scope of the integration effort also includes planning for Field Service Representatives (FSRs) and other technical support personnel, coordination and movement of the Fleet vehicles, and inventory management of systems.\n\nFollowing completion of platform integration efforts, these funds support a structured network VALEX consisting of four subordinate efforts; Load Exercise (LOADEX), ESTABLISH, INTEGRATE, and VALIDATE:\n- LOADEX; Support unit installation of new network capabilities into existing network, to include setting Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and configure network systems changes; modify radio mission plans, system configuration files and system parameters; and perform test\/fix\/test processes at the system and component levels.\n- ESTABLISH; Verification of new hardware and software performance at the platform level. Troubleshoot issues associated with network system configurations and verify that each integrated platform can perform its mission while operating on the network.\n- INTEGRATE; Verification of networked related hardware\/software performance and networked communications at each echelon. Troubleshoot issues found with new capabilities and ensure tactical unit information exchange will enable units to support their intended missions.\n- VALIDATE; Support unit conduct of mission threads to verify the correct routing of messages and information transfer among critical nodes in the network.\n\nExecution: \nFunding supports all management and synchronization of field operations and support personnel during the events and coordination with the supported command. It also includes monitoring of network operations in the field, trouble ticket management, continued LBRR support to troubleshoot technical issues, deployment of mobile facilities, and replacement parts\/ components required to effectively support concepts and capabilities under assessment.\n\nCloseout: \nThese funds support all activities associated with the de-installation and recovery of systems, components, A-kits, cabling installed on platforms, and restoration of platforms to baseline configurations. Removal, inspection, repair\/replacement, shipping, and storing of all materiel and infrastructure used to enable the unit to execute the event. Conduct AARs for process improvements.\nAssessment:  These funds support activities associated with providing documentation and technical assessment of the system of systems architecture to include interfaces between systems, compare and contrast between architecture characteristics, and compliance with published network standards.\n\nIn FY 2020 the Joint Warfighter Assessment (JWA), a key component of the Army's Force 2025 Maneuvers, will occur in Europe in support of US Army Europe and US European Command. The JWA is used to assess interim solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges. The JWA concept maximizes collective resources to advance joint and multinational interoperability, future force development, and unit training readiness priorities. Concepts and capabilities are embedded in a live, virtual, and constructive Multinational Division (MND) exercise that is representative of current and future operational environments. The JWA provides a unique opportunity to increase innovation, improve interoperability, and enhance unit readiness. JWA offers the triple pay-off with future force development, training readiness, and Joint \/ Multinational interoperability assessment opportunities. These funds support the following major efforts associated with an assessment:\n\n- Planning: Coordination with multiple stakeholders on the participation and resourcing of personnel, services, equipment and prototypes, and other deliverables needed for risk reduction events, capability and platform integration, training, field support and logistics, event battle rhythm\/schedule, and developing network data products.\n- Preparation: Conduct risk reduction, complete system integrated designs and builds, build prototype vehicles for safety release, conduct system installation and checkout, validate the network, and obtain Information Assurance certifications. A key preparation task is the full scale live network validation event, which includes Cyber Vulnerability and Penetration Assessment of the network. This ensures the technical architecture and security procedures are place to support an exercise of this scale and complexity. Additionally, preparation efforts will supports new system user training.\n- Execution: Technical and logistics support during soldier-led assessments, trouble ticket management and closeout, and field support management.\n- Close-out: Inventorying platforms\/systems, de-installing equipment, returning platforms to their original configurations. All unit equipment will be returned to original configuration following the exercise to ensure unit is fully prepared to execute wartime mission. The final close out task is conduct of After Action Review (AAR) and capture of lessons learned both for systems and architecture, as well as process and procedures for support exercises. \n\nThese funds may also be used for procuring limited equipment and materials (to include prototypes, when required), event infrastructure, field services, personnel support (government and contractor), and travel. These funds may also support similar activities for smaller assessment events leading up to the Joint Warfighter Assessment. Additionally, these funds will support initial planning for the Joint Warfighter 21, scheduled to support US Pacific Command and US Army Pacific. Planning events may occur at home station or require travel to support unit locations. Planning activities will include things such as concept and capability solicitation, initial architecture considerations, and logistics planning."

Synchronized Fielding (CSSF) efforts.  Prepared ?as-built? NBOI and final IMS for units fielded during FY19, maintained unit-specific NBOI and IMS for units designated to undergo CS integration in FY 2020-2021, and developed initial (draft-level) NBOI and IMS for planned units in FY 2022 thru FY 2023.  Organized, prepared, and conducted incremental technical reviews to examine and assess key\/crucial planning activities and associated data product development supporting CS integration at specific fielded locations.  Collected and analyzed sub-schedule performance against the baseline IMS to identify schedule risks for the Army?s CSSF efforts. Validated that established incremental integration points were achievable and, if not, identified the risk to schedule.  Analyzed schedule and cost performance against established baselines, identified variances and their causes, and identified risks and\/or impacts to critical path. Performed ?what if? schedule and cost analyses of alternative program courses of action to determine impact on schedule critical path and mission requirements. Updated and posted schedules on SharePoint for visibility and increased collaboration across the entire CS community to include ASA(ALT). Led or participated in other key technical reviews to include: After Action Reviews, Lessons Learned, Synchronized Fielding Technical Exchange Meetings (TEMs) and mini-TEMs.  Provided reports and briefings to key CS stakeholders to support mutual programmatic goals and objectives and to help resolve issues and concerns affecting the CS community at-large.

This project develops process, products, and policies that ensure a solid Army Systems Engineering construct across Army Program Executive and Management Offices. \n\nThis includes efforts in support of Common Operating Environment (COE) governance, the Army Futures Command's emerging development of concepts, requirements generation, resource allocation, experimentation, acquisition, logistics, and technology components of the Army Future Force Modernization Enterprise (FFME).  Focus areas includes the integration of key elements of a system into one overall system engineering construct and managing it through major system engineering activities to ensure the fielding of integrated capabilities meet the mission needs of the force against any potential adversaries.  Key system engineering functions include, engineering and technical analysis, integrated System of Systems (SoS) architecture products, SoS risk analysis and mitigation planning to influence the Army's materiel portfolio.  This project also includes the establishment of Army systems engineering policy and implementation standards, requirements decomposition and alignment, and resource and acquisition synchronization to address cross-portfolio issues.  Key tasks are the development of integrated Architecture products; Engineering Analysis and Design; Portfolio Analysis; Systems Security Engineering process, interoperability assessments, Cybersecurity requirements analysis, compliance, and Cyber policy assessments. \n\nThe effort includes costs for labor (Government and contractor), support services, travel, training, supplies, facilities, and Information Technology (IT) support for Office of Chief Systems Engineer (OCSE).  This effort funds Government labor for the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO). This project also includes support to other Department of Defense (DOD) and international agencies for joint programs and collaboration effort.  \n\nUnder this Project we have four efforts: Army System of Systems Engineering and Analysis, Cyber, Facilities\/IT and Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) Core Labor. The RCCTO core labor line is funded for RCCTO core labor for FY 2020 only. It supports the newly established FY 2020 RCCTO PROGRAM ELEMENT (PE) 0605054A PROJECT FI3 line which will fund the RCCTO projec ts."

This program engineers and developmentally tests organic and remote sensors, communication interfaces, and processing and display devices.  This equipment is engineered to measure, ingest, store, process, distribute and display conditions of the physical environment that are essential to the optimum employment and performance of naval warfare systems.  AOEE also engineers capabilities for shipboard and shore-based tactical systems.  A major area of focus for the AOEE program is to provide the engineering development of specialized equipment and measurement capabilities that are intended to monitor specific conditions of the physical environment in hostile and remote areas in response to fleet demand signals for increased sensing capability and capacity to support battlespace collections and prediction on short to intermediate time scales.  With such capabilities, the war fighters' situational awareness of the operational effects of the physical environment are made more certain.\n\nMajor emphasis is on the Meteorological and Oceanographic Future Mission Capabilities (METOC FMC) project."

Development of support infrastructure for advanced global & regional METOC prediction systems.  The Navy decided to discontinue the FMC project label, starting in 2018.  This was done as part of an effort to restructure METOC research and development funding into the Tasking, Collection, Prediction, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) construct coming into common use throughout Naval Information Forces. This restructuring for FY18 moves all METOC RDT&E into PE 0603207N. FY2017 FMC efforts will be remapped to TCPED based projects in FY2018."

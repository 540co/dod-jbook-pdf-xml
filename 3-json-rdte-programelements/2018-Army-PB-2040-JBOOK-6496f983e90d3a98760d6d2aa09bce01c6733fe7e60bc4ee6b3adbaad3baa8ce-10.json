This venue allows analysis in areas that would be too dangerous or too expensive to assess during a live demonstration, as well as supports future \u201cwhat if\u201d assessments. Outputs of these exercises influence technologies and scenarios chosen for Systems Intensive Analysis and Field Demonstrations. This effort builds upon the work previously completed in Rapidly Deployable Technologies and Technology Systems Adaptive Red Teaming."

Exercises will cover broader time and space conditions than are possible in live field experiments.  Will implement team challenge experiments to identify potential vulnerabilities and risks for developing concepts or systems; and, based on previous year evaluations, modify analysis methodologies, structured assessments, and frameworks to improve data captured for analysis and feedback, with the goal of providing insight and data to enable risk mitigation, informing current or future acquisition programs early in the development lifecycle. Potential technical areas of interest will include force protection, interoperability, internet of things, autonomous systems, and electronic warfare."

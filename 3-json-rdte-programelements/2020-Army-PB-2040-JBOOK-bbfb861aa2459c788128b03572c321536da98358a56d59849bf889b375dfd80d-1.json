Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.\n\nPromising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for human medical products, and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides). The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and\/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small group human study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct safety and effectiveness clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large pivotal trials in diverse populations will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and small safety and effectiveness studies involving humans according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA or EPA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.\n\nBlast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center. This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by: the U.S. Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD."

The focus of the Project is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This Project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this Project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from arthropods to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nResearch conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1)\tPrevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2)\tBacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3)\tViral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4)\tDiagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n\nResearch is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).\n\nWork is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.\n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A (Medical Systems - Adv Dev), Project 808 (DoD Drug & Vacc Ad).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY20 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by USAMRMC at Fort Detrick, MD.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases."

This effort selects candidate vaccines for various types of malaria, including the severe form of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (Plasmodium vivax), prepares technical data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans, and conducts testing of promising malaria vaccine candidates in humans.

These efforts will support initial and sustained integrated theater health care and trauma care delivery in future dispersed operations characterized by delayed evacuation, prolonged care, and reduced\/denied communications. AI and machine learning technologies developed in this Project aim to reduce military combat casualties by enabling autonomous evacuation utilizing future Army Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and ground platforms. Pursuant to these aims, this Project will research and design a tele-monitored and remote-controlled medical module to support medical resupply and casualty evacuation. The medical module will be developed to be self-contained, providing a \"roll-on, roll-off\" medical capability to future multi-purpose UAS and ground platforms.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by: the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD."

Will continue to pursue an expanded Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) DNA vaccine clinical trial in a country\/region that has endemic HFRS cases. Will continue to test for safety and effectiveness of the HFRS DNA vaccine."

The vaccine will be effective in people with and without a prior history of dengue infection. Infectious disease prevention sustains individual and unit readiness and reduces health services requirements and cost.\n\nWork in this Project is managed by the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.\n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A, Project 808.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY 2020 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by USAMRMC at Fort Detrick, MD.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases."

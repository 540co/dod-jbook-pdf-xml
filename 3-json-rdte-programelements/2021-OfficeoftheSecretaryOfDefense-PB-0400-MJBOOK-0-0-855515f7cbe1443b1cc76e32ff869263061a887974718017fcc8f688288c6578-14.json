Previously, the Technology Watch \/ Horizon Scan program was aligned under PE 0602234D8Z P525 (Office of Technical Intelligence). In FY 2021, this project has been administratively realigned after the reorganization of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, but the scope of work and relative funding remains unchanged. The analysis performed in the PE uses the operational context of Joint and cross-domain missions by leveraging Combatant Commands (COCOM) and Joint Staff warfighting concepts. Throughout this process the analysis will be tightly coupled with both the Intelligence community and the operational community through the Joint Staff. Global science and technology (S&T) awareness and context is provided by the Technology Watch \/ Horizon Scan Program, and combined with the operational and technical analyses, informs DoD technology, engineering, and acquisition planning to inform the strategic capability development decisions of the OUSD(R&E). \n\nAnalysis and assessments are focused on challenges related to the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objectives and adversary research and development trends.  Three analysis methods are used: 1) Operational and Technical Assessments identify gaps and options to fill those gaps; 2) Technical Analysis quantifies key attributes of the challenge, assesses counter technology options, and provides an operational value assessment; and 3) the Quick Reaction Analysis Team provides quick turn analysis on emerging challenges and senior leader issues using the Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC\/UARC) community as performers while leveraging previous related experience and work done for the Department of Defense (DoD). Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing analytic assessments can span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. Analytic tools are developed and used to identify and track investment data to identify promising areas of capability development."

These areas include: space and terrestrial-based indications and warnings systems, integrated and resilient Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, long-range precision strike weapons, missile defense technologies, undersea systems, remotely operated vehicles and technologies, special operations forces, the Cyber Mission Force, ground systems, and other technologies related to the NDS Modernization Priorities. Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. The emerging nature of the problem sets makes specific identification of all the study projects beyond the budget year unlikely. Implementation of this process spans multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year-to-year.\n\nOperational and Technical Assessments are informed by comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2020-2040 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas. These products support detailed analyses and assessments to help shape technology investment decisions and inform the strategic direction of capability development. Because of the 20 year timeframe, these analyses will also help to inform requirements rather than waiting for current processes to develop them. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-Conduct KCA across NDS Scenarios and other relevant DoD Vignettes to identify and characterize capability disadvantages and opportunities across the battlespace.\n-Conduct analysis on operational challenges, and existing and emerging capabilities to assess options that address those challenges within the NDS Scenarios.\n-Produce operational impact assessments of potential technology improvements to military capabilities in the near, mid, and far term.\n-Produce standardized technology-focused timelines to summarize and track DoD progress toward technical dominance in each of the NDS technology modernization areas.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team perform engineering level systems analysis using the DoD sponsored FFRDC\/UARC and Department of Defense and Department of Energy (DoD\/DoE) laboratories. Using these research performers, previously sponsored research on relevant topics is leveraged in the new research providing value and experience on new projects. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-Technical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.\n-Quantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies.\n-Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development.\n\nAnalytic Tools include modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A), computer based engineering models, to confirm theoretical performance of technical concepts. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-Develop analytic tools to inform and provide decision support to resourcing recommendations.\n-Develop strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.\n-Integrated MS&A leveraging Service- and Agency\u2013level virtual and constructive resources to provide insight into complex acquisition and operational decisions.\n\nRed Teaming existing and planned U.S. capabilities and weapons systems using emerging threat systems and capabilities in emerging scenarios."

The activities include: develop strategies, plans and policies to execute and manage TW\/HS Tool Exploitation effort; conduct technology analyses and technology scouting to support the TW\/HS program mission; and, produce technical reports and informational white papers, using TW\/HS capabilities, to identify and track global technology trends to support the TW\/HS program mission.

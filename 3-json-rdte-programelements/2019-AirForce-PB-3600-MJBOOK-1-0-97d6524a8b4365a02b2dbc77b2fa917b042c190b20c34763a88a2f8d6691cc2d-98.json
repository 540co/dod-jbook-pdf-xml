        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The SBIRS RDT&E FY 2019 budget justification exhibits describe three elements of the SBIRS program: 1) the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program of record PNO 210 MDAP, 2) the Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) (non-MDAP) and the 3) Evolved SBIRS follow-on (pre-MDAP PNO 499).\n\n1. SBIRS EMD: The Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces, and its allies. SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. SBIRS supports Missile Defense, Battlespace Awareness, and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable, accurate, and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, the intelligence community, and other users. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance over legacy systems in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's (AFSPC) Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements. The space segment consists of Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements, communications infrastructure, and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. Four HEO payloads and four GEO satellites are on-orbit. Two of the four GEO and two of the four HEO satellites have completed AFSPC and USSTRATCOM operational acceptance and are certified for Integrated Tactical Warning\/ Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations. HEO-3 and HEO-4 are in a storage\/residual operational mode. GEO-4 (Flight 3) and GEO-3 (Flight 4) are proceeding through on-orbit checkout and infrared sensor tuning following their respective launches in Jan 2017 and Jan 2018. The program of record (PoR)ground segment development exploits both the new scanner and starer sensor data through software processing and builds user messages for missile warning and missile defense. Also, data exploitation efforts enable access to raw and processed data to expand capabilities for battlespace awareness and other applications. The baseline requirement document is the 1996 SBIRS ORD. Enterprise Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) provides intra- and inter-program requirements development, enterprise master planning, validation and verification, specialty engineering, and architecture development.\n\n2. SMI: The primary objective of SMI is to enable and inform future decisions to maintain and evolve a capable, resilient, and affordable OPIR architecture by maturing technologies and mitigating risk areas to facilitate OPIR modernization within the Department's constrained resources. SMI supports the PoR by assessing future parts and material obsolescence and designing future space and ground modifications focused on affordability and capability while simultaneously maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements. The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current PoR SBIRS constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. Based on the outcome of these studies and technology development, the Sensor Ground Demonstration will develop capability for current, next generation sensors, processors, and algorithms. SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR mission data processing (MDP), data fusion, data dissemination, algorithm development, network connectivity, efficient interfaces and sensor performance assessments to enable greater exploitation of SBIRS PoR and other data sources. SMI exploitation efforts build upon PoR capabilities and inform the PoR decision process. The data exploitation efforts identify affordable, responsive and resilient measures to improve technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to enhance OPIR support to the warfighters and other data users. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View (WFOV) Testbed activities explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem\/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture. Hosted Payloads and WFOV Testbeds support maturation of MDP algorithms for tactical and strategic applications which are critical demonstration efforts to enhance PoR capabilities and to reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the PoR. Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and to reduce risk for possible SBIRS follow-on architectures. SBIRS Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) infrastructure modernization efforts under SMI will introduce Telemetry, Tracking and Command systems (TT&C) and Ground Control automation, Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) MDP as well as competition into SBIRS Ground with an emphasis to on-ramp to EGS as soon as practical. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded tradespace and improve the competitive environment. \n\n3. Evolved SBIRS: The Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) will consist of Command and Control (C2) migration to Enterprise Ground Services (EGS), modernization of Mission Data Processing (MDP), and required development\/upgrades to Remote Ground Stations (RGS). The FORGE effort will implement an open framework for mission data processing and migration of C2 of satellite operations to integrate with EGS. FORGE and EGS efforts will provide the flexibility to integrate new MDP capabilities and more efficiently allow the system to meet evolving warfighter needs.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SBIRS High EMD, SMI, and OPIR Enterprise weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements to full-rate production."

SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. SBIRS supports Missile Defense, Battlespace Awareness, and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable, accurate, and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, the intelligence community, and other users. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance over legacy systems in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's (AFSPC) Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements. The space segment consists of GEO satellites, payloads hosted on satellites in HEO, and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements, communications infrastructure, and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. The three HEO payloads and two GEO satellites are on-orbit.  Both GEO and two of the four HEO satellites have completed AFSPC and USSTRATCOM operational acceptance and are certified for Integrated Tactical Warning\/Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations.  HEO-3 is in a storage\/residual operational mode.  The PoR ground segment development exploits both the new scanner and starer sensor data through software processing and builds user messages for missile warning and missile defense. Also, data exploitation efforts enable access to raw and processed data to expand capabilities for battlespace awareness and other applications.  SBIRS ground system cyber defense increases resiliency by resolving legacy DSP network architecture issues and establishes an active cyber defense capability. The baseline requirement document is the 1996 SBIRS ORD. Enterprise SE&I provides intra- and inter-program requirements development, enterprise master planning, validation and verification, specialty engineering, and architecture development."

SMI supports the PoR by assessing future parts and material obsolescence and designing future space and ground modifications focused on affordability and capability while simultaneously maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements.  The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current PoR SBIRS constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. Based on the outcome of these studies and technology development, the Sensor Ground Demonstration will develop capability for current, next generation sensors, processors, and algorithms.  SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR mission data processing, data fusion, data dissemination, algorithm development, network connectivity, efficient interfaces and sensor performance assessments to enable greater exploitation of SBIRS PoR and other data sources. SMI exploitation efforts build upon PoR capabilities and inform the PoR decision process. The data exploitation efforts identify affordable, responsive and resilient measures to improve technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to enhance OPIR support to the warfighters and other data users. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View (WFOV) Testbed activities explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem\/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture. Hosted Payloads and WFOV Testbeds support maturation of MDP algorithms for tactical and strategic applications which are critical demonstration efforts to enhance PoR capabilities and to reduce program risks for future OPIR systems.  Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and to reduce risk for possible SBIRS follow-on architectures.  SBIRS EGS infrastructure modernization efforts under SMI will introduce Telemetry, Tracking and Command systems (TT&C) and Ground Control automation, FORGE MDP as well as competition into SBIRS Ground with an emphasis to on-ramp to EGS as soon as practical.  SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded tradespace and improve the competitive environment."

Activities, such as SBIRS obsolescence and affordability enhancements to the existing satellite design, will leverage existing PoR contracts. Technology maturation and component prototyping and\/or qualification could leverage existing contracts; in fact many are planned in collaboration with AFRL and other government agencies.  Where practical, other efforts could be competed.  FFRDC and SETA contractors will also be used to conduct and support studies.  New technology, replacement components, and system designs will be acquired with government data rights to the maximum extent to allow their incorporation into any future OPIR satellite production or system development.  Contracting partnerships with other agencies will also be used to study, develop, demonstrate and prove emerging capabilities."

This agility must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to speed decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\"\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SBIRS HIGH EMD, SMI, and OPIR Enterprise weapon system capabilities.

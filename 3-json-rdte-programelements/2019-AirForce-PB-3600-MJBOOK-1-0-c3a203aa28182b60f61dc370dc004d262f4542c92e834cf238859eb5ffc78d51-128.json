SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $6.4B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  In FY12, as an AF pilot initiative, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&M to RDT&E, AF funds. \n\nSMC is authorized to employ approximately 1,501 civilian acquisition professionals providing the management, tools, and technical capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB 61 Air Base Group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Air Force initiatives in response to the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act.  This program element supports both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\"\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

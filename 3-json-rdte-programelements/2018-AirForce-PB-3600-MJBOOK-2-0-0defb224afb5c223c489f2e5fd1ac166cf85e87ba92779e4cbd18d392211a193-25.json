Operational since 1980, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions, such as, offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day\/night and all-weather) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)\/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD\/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies to meet emerging warfighter requirements and combat current and evolving enemy threats.  \n\nThe modification programs are separated as fleet wide, Pre-Block (25\/30\/32) or Post-Block (40\/42\/50\/52). Modification programs include: Operational Flight Program (OFP) development on Post-Block OFPs required to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to meet DoD mandates and keep the F-16, the respective training simulators, and other hardware subsystems current; Legacy Post-Block Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which is a two-phased RDT&E effort, includes a Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to increase Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective); EMD Hardware\/Advanced capability improvements require funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence; Modular Mission Computer (MMC)Upgrade\/Display Generator Upgrade resolves shortfalls in Post-Block mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability addresses cyber-security and includes Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground\/flight test for fielding; F-16 Training Simulator updates enable the USAF to exercise\/train using the most current F-16 OFP available to all block configurations, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers; Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) on F-16 Post-Block aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and flight test; improved satellite communication (SATCOM) radio upgrade with Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capability on F-16 Post-Block aircraft to meet next-gen tactical narrowband SATCOM with better crypto capabilities; an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar capable on all blocks that offers advanced electronic protection capabilities as well as improved reliability and maintainability on F-16 aircraft that perform the aerospace alert control mission; Hybrid Flight Control Computer (HFLCC) Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS)  development and integration prevents most controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents using terrain database and prediction algorithms for aircraft trajectory recovery and executes an automated fly up maneuver to avoid collision; Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Broadcast (ADS-B) Out on F-16 Pre-Block aircraft provides improved altitude, airspeed and location info to ground stations and other equipped aircraft in vicinity; Digital Radar Warning Receiver improves on existing radar warning receiver performance and improves Electronic Warfare (EW) threat detection range, azimuth, detection time, and allows reduction of radio frequency compatibility issues with other on board transmitters.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

M7+ OFP SW development effort is now completely developed at Hill AFB (309 SMXG).  Numerous Integration contracts (CPFF, FFP) are required to allow for Weapon, ADS-B, MIDS- JTRs integration to successfully field with each OFP. \n \nThe Legacy SLEP program uses various contracts supporting Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and feeds the EMD effort to develop mod test kits and airworthiness certification recommendation. The prime contractor providing the majority of EMD is Lockheed Martin.  \n\nMMC Upgrade, PDG Upgrade programs have completed source selection. MMC Upgrade awarded to Raytheon on 22 Nov 2016. PDG Upgrade awarded to General Dynamics Mission Systems on 17 Apr 2017.\n\nThe EMD HW\/Advanced capability improvements will develop, test, and qualify aircraft weapons systems, including subsystems and uses various contract types (Cost Plus and Fixed Price) \n\nThe Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON)development is currently in negotiations with the prime vendor for a development contract award for the EMD phase.\n\nThe new start programs in FY18; Digital Radar Warning Receiver, ADS-B Out Pre-Blocks and Auto-GCAS Pre-Block are all in acquisition development prior to entering source selection.\n\nFlight Test requires both organic test range support and various contract support for integration test of F-16 subsystems to ensure capabilities meet CAF fielding schedule."

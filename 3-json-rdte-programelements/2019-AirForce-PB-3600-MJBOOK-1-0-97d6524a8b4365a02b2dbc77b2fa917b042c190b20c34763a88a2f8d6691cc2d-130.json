The RSLP mission was established by the Secretary of Defense in 1972.  It provides mission planning, payload integration, vehicle acquisition, processing, launch operations, booster storage and disposition, aging surveillance, maintenance and logistics support for selected DoD responsive space and RDT&E launches.  Costs directly attributable to a specific launch or program (e.g. reliability of flight testing, maintenance of launch vehicle processing infrastructure) are paid by the user (Air Force, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), etc.).  RSLP maintains exclusive control of deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper assets used in testing to include refurbishment, transportation and handling, storage, aging surveillance, and launch services.  RSLP also funds general research, development, and supplemental reliability of flight testing efforts for launch to enhance the reliability of the Minotaur and other fleet vehicles (e.g., updates to the Modular Mechanical Ordnance Destruct System).\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\"\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

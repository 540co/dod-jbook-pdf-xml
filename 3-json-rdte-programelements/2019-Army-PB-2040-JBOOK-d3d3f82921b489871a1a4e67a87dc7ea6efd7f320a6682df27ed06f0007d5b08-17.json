            "val": "Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program for Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing elevated, persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks, enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as critical geo political assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets. A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74- meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.\n\nJLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.\n\nJLENS prepared and  participated in Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) with NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region (NCR) Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Operational Exercise (OPEX) from FY14-FY16 as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.  The OPEX included an operational assessment to \"inform a future decision for enduring operational employment\", in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13. The Combatant Command (CCMD) objective for the OPEX was to provide the full range of JLENS Orbit level capability to include: Persistent Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) through Battle Command System Fixed (BCS-F) Integration Combat Identification (CID) \/ Electronic Identification (EID) Precision Cue to Fighters\/Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) via Tactical Data Link (TDL) Integrated Fire Control to Fighters (IFC)\/GBAD via TDL.\n\nJLENS ended OPEX participation in October 2015 with the direction to store the system in place. \n\nJLENS received an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), dated 18 July 2017, directing the program to prepare and submit a program termination plan.  Disposition of 185 ISO containers consisting of classified and unclassified material along with 12 trailers will take two years (FY 2018-2019).  In FY 2018, the focus is on the disposition of classified and starting the disposition of unclassified material.  The remaining unclassified material will be disposed of in FY 2019."

JLENS participation in the OPEX was terminated per an Under Secretary for Defense Policy decision memorandum dated 15 June 2016.  In accordance with Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) direction, JLENS equipment supporting the OPEX was packed and stored at the APG sites effective 21 June 2016, pending higher headquarters decision on the future of the JLENS program.\n\nJLENS ended OPEX participation in October 2015 with the direction to store the system in place. \n\nJLENS received an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), dated 18 July 2017, directing the program to prepare and submit a program termination plan.

JLENS participation in the OPEX was to allow for a combatant commander's operational assessment of JLENS capabilities to \"inform a future decision for enduring operational employment\". \n\nOperational Control of JLENS for the OPEX was transferred to the NORAD\/NORTHCOM Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC) on 15 October 2015.  Due to a tether break accident on 28 October 2015 resulting in the loss of the Fire Control System aerostat, significant damage to the Radar and Mobile Mooring Station, the Commander NORAD\/NORTHCOM suspended JLENS participation in the OPEX pending results from accident investigations and Failure Review Board recommendations.  JLENS participation in the OPEX was terminated per an Under Secretary for Defense Policy decision memorandum dated 15 June 2016.  In accordance with Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) direction, JLENS equipment supporting the OPEX was packed and stored at the APG sites effective 21 June 2016, pending higher headquarters decision on the future of the JLENS program. Courses of action under consideration are staging JLENS equipment in indefinite storage to meet potential future contingency requirements; and termination of the JLENS program with disposition\/demilitarization of JLENS equipment."

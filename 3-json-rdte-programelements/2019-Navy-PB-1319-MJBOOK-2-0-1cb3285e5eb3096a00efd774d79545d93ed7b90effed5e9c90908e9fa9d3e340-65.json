In January of 2016, PE 0605414N PU 3278 was established as the principal budget line for MQ-25. In January of 2018, PU 3279 was established for the Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS).\n\nThe President's Budget FY17 PE 0605414N PU 3278 submission was initially regarded as Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS)\/UCLASS Development. To better align with the mission and capability funded under PE 0605414N, it is now referred to as Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA)\/MQ-25."

            "val": "The MQ-25 program rapidly develops an unmanned capability to embark on CVNs as part of the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) to conduct aerial refueling  as a primary mission and provide Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) capability as a secondary mission.  MQ-25 extends CVW mission effectiveness range, partially mitigates the current Carrier Strike Group (CSG) organic ISR shortfall and fills the future CVW-tanker gap, mitigating Strike Fighter shortfall and preserving F\/A-18E\/F Fatigue Life for its primary missions. As the first carrier-based, group 5 Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), MQ-25 will pioneer the integration of manned and unmanned operations, demonstrate mature complex sea-based Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) UAS technologies, and pave the way for future multifaceted multi-mission UAS to pace emerging threats.  \n\nMQ-25 requirements are aligned with the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Family of Systems (FoS) ICD, which highlight the need for carrier-based refueling  and persistent ISR capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) endorsed the UCLASS ICD in April 2011 and formally approved it on 9 Jun 11 via Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 087-11.  The NGAD FoS ICD was validated by the JROC on 18 August 2015 and formally approved by JROCM 087-15. The JROC's guidance delineated in the validated ICDs and subsequent JROCMs was to establish a requirement for a versatile platform that supports a myriad of organic Naval missions such as aerial refueling and ISR to support the CSG. The JROC validated the Capability Development Document (CDD) for MQ-25 Carrier Based Unmanned Air System (CBUAS) on 21 July 2017. MQ-25 is expected to provide an Initial Operational Capability to the fleet in 2026.\n\nThe newly established ACAT III Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS). UMCS is comprised of the Control System & Connectivity (CS&C) and Carrier (CVN) Segments previously captured under the MQ-25 Development PU 3278.\n\nThe Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS) program consists of the MQ-25 control station, designated the MD-5, and modifications to the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems and Carrier Vessel, Nuclear (CVN) infrastructure required for MQ-25 vehicle and mission control.\n\nThis program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION  because it includes some projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production decision."

                            "val": "The MQ-25 program rapidly develops an unmanned capability to embark on CVNs as part of the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) to conduct aerial refueling  as a primary mission and provide Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) capability as a secondary mission.  MQ-25 extends CVW mission effectiveness range, partially mitigates the current Carrier Strike Group (CSG) organic ISR shortfall and fills the future CVW-tanker gap, mitigating Strike Fighter shortfall and preserving F\/A-18E\/F Fatigue Life for its primary missions. As the first carrier-based, group 5 Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), MQ-25 will pioneer the integration of manned and unmanned operations, demonstrate mature complex sea-based Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) UAS technologies, and pave the way for future multifaceted multi-mission UAS to pace emerging threats.  \n\nMQ-25 requirements are aligned with the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Family of Systems (FoS) ICD, which highlight the need for carrier-based refueling  and persistent ISR capabilities.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) endorsed the UCLASS ICD in April 2011 and formally approved it on 9 Jun 11 via Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 087-11.  The NGAD FoS ICD was validated by the JROC on 18 August 2015 and formally approved by JROCM 087-15. The JROC's guidance delineated in the validated ICDs and subsequent JROCMs was to establish a requirement for a versatile platform that supports a myriad of organic Naval missions such as aerial refueling and ISR to support the CSG. The JROC validated the Capability Development Document (CDD) for MQ-25 Carrier Based Unmanned Air System (CBUAS) on 21 July 2017. MQ-25 is expected to provide an Initial Operational Capability to the fleet in 2026.\n\nMQ-25 will be designed to conduct aerial refueling and ISR missions.  MQ-25 will have the ability to refuel all carrier based fixed wing aircraft capable of aerial refueling and to pass sensor data to other aircraft, naval vessels, and ground forces.  Sensor data will be transmitted at appropriate classification levels, to exploitation nodes afloat and ashore (e.g. Distributed Common Ground System - Navy).  The MQ-25 system will be sustainable onboard an aircraft carrier, as well as ashore, and will be designed to minimize the logistics footprint of the current CVW.\n\nMQ-25 will achieve these capabilities through the use of a carrier-suitable, semi-autonomous, Unmanned Air Segment; a Control System and Connectivity Segment; and a Carrier Segment. The Government will perform Lead Systems Integration (LSI), providing government-led system of systems integration for the MQ-25 Program. The LSI will coordinate across all segments and with external stakeholders to ensure program activities are synchronized.  MQ-25 will interface with existing ship and land-based command and control systems, including ISR Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination systems.\n\nThe scope of the program includes, but is not limited to, system level requirements identification, allocation of requirements to segments and components, design, development, integration, fabrication, test, training, and support activities to provide the MQ-25 capabilities. To accomplish these capabilities MQ-25 will transition (as required) technologies from other programs and adapt them into the carrier environment.  MQ-25 will deliver the necessary air vehicles, command, control, connectivity, shipboard and land-based launch and recovery control systems, associated support systems, interfaces, and upgrades to other Navy systems (as required) to meet the required capabilities."

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2430(d)(1), the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) is ASN(RDA).\n\nThe MQ-25 system will enhance carrier (CVN) capability and versatility for the Joint Forces Commander through the integration of a persistent, sea-based, multi-mission aerial refueling and reconnaissance Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) into the Carrier Air Wing (CVW).  MQ-25 is comprised of three major architectural segments: an Air Segment (AS), a Control System & Connectivity (CS&C) Segment, and a CVN Segment.  These segments will be managed by the PMA-268 Government Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) that provides system-of-systems integration and is also responsible for managing enterprise-level UCA architecture and associated interfaces. \n\nMQ-25 will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy to develop, fly, deploy, and evolve an Initial Operational Capability system for fleet integration.  This MQ-25 acquisition strategy will support the development of the MQ-25 AS, supporting control and connectivity systems, and CVN modifications required for entry into Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) in 2018 with an objective IOC of 2024 and a threshold IOC of 2026.  \n\nMQ-25 will pursue a fixed price incentive, firm target (FPIF) contract for the AS EMD contract."

Hardware modifications include configuration of the Unmanned Aviation Warfare Center (UAWC) which houses the MD-5 components, a Video Management System (VMS) and an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Mission Commander (UMC) station, and procurement and installation of an ARC-210 Radio Control System required for MQ-25 command and control (C2). Software modifications required for MQ-25 include changes to the Joint Precision Approach Landing System (JPALS) and the Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) systems.\n\nCVN installations are regulated by NAVSEASYSCOM processes\/guidelines which identify strict deadlines for documentation, drawings, and material availability due dates to support carrier modifications and due to the extent of the hardware modification, by the CVN availability schedule which identifies significant maintenance periods (revised at least twice per year) which could, in turn, drive changes to the CVN segment installation schedule."

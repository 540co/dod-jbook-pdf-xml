The speed and reactivity of the modern technology-threat environment challenge the traditional top-down model of defense problem-solving and capability development. Mitigating this deficiency requires developing internal workforce and organizational competencies and associated resources related to problem framing, knowledge and resource sharing, and non-traditional partnerships. Consistent with guidance from the Secretary of Defense and new Defense Innovation Initiative (DII), MD5 is a portfolio of innovation programs that (1) accelerates capability development leveraging non-traditional collaborators and \u201cbottom-up\u201d approaches, (2) augments the defense industry through the creation of startup businesses, and (3) enhances the DOD workforce through critical innovation skills development.\n\nThis program seeks to maintain the long-term competitive advantage for the US military over adversaries by tapping into high-potential uniformed and civilian employees of the DoD (i.e. intrapreneurs) and increasing their interactions with high-speed innovators and entrepreneurs outside of the DoD. This is accomplished by providing training and tools to these DoD intrapreneurs that empower them to find new ways to identify, frame, and solve problems as well as opening avenues to broadly implement the solutions they create. Additionally, the programs executed create opportunities for external innovators and entrepreneurs to be exposed to DoD problems and allow them to demonstrate possible solutions they can bring to bear on problems.\n\nMD5\/NSTA carries out its mission via three portfolios of effort: Education, Collaboration, and Acceleration. MD5 education and training programs develop DOD and industry personnel educated to continuously test and improve legacy processes and systems. MD5 collaboration programs like crowdsourcing develop human-centered networks that address DOD capability needs in an agile, cost-effective manner. MD5 acceleration programs develop ventures inside and outside of DOD that develop, commercialize, or apply technology relevant to warfighter problem sets.\n\nMD5 is a Congressional interest program that has received funding in FY 2016 ($5M), FY 2017 ($25M), FY 2018 ($25.5M), and FY 2019 ($15M)."

Also planning pilot with Idea Forge at CU Boulder.\n\u2022 \u201cFed Tech\u201d pairs cutting edge inventor teams and technologies from the United States federal government laboratory system with highly qualified entrepreneurs to conduct customer discovery and build business models. The program leverages lean startup techniques, while also focusing on the unique aspects of turning a federally funded technology into a startup company. The program is split into two phases: Phase 1 \u2013 Startup Studio focuses on technology selection and team formation; Phase 2 \u2013 Pre-Accelerator is a deeper dive with the best teams from Phase 1 to focus on building a company around the technology.\n\u2022 \u201cMD5 Starts\u201d is a format for showcasing early stage startups who are working on technologies and products that are pursuing a dual-use market strategy. MD5 acts as a facilitator and convener amongst the ecosystem actors in a local geography, from incubator and accelerator programs, to research universities, startups and local or regional economic development organizations. \nThe goal of the event is to showcase the great economic opportunity that exists in building companies that have both great market potential and which address important and urgent needs of national security and defense.\n\u2022 \u201cHatch\u201d helps entrepreneurs\/teams with an idea (i.e., from H4D) learn how to form and build a venture using industry best practices. The initial pilot is with the Founder Institute incubator program where MD5 candidates will participate.\n\u2022 \u201cPropel\u201d provides companies that have prototypes or initial customers with world-class education, mentorship, and relevant business connections to prepare the venture for scale while elevating their visibility in the venture community. The initial pilots of this program are with TechStars and MassChallenge. This program envisions feeding from Hacks and H4D.\n\u2022 \u201cGauge\u201d provides facilities, access, materials, and training to entrepreneurs to develop, iterate, and refine their technology up to TRL 6\/7. Also provide access to test and development ranges.\n\u2022 \u201cLaunch\u201d identifies existing government technology that can be applied to a stated customer problem or problem set and to then work with a team on a path to commercialize that technology.\n\u2022 \u201cBoost\u201d provides opportunities for companies to secure early, non-dilutive government funding in the form of grants or contracts.  This program will rely on the use of Small Business Innovation Research grants\/contracts.\n\u2022 \u201cBridge\u201d provides founding teams with mentors and advisors who can help them in business, customer, and product\ndevelopment by providing the right advice and insights at the right time.\n\nPlatform\n\u2022 \u201cDefense Innovation Network\u201d is the online platform (currently www.md5.net) that MD5 is developing to facilitate gathering ideas and building a network of DoD innovators both inside and outside of the DoD. This platform is used for both the Hacks and Source.\n\nAccomplishments to-date:\n1.

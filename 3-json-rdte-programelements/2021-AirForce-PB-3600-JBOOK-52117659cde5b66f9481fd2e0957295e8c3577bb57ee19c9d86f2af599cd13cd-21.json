The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed in a plug-and-play mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and GCS configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.\n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper system has four separate development programs. This PE includes:\n1. MQ-9 System Lifecycle Agile Modernization (SLAM). This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using an Agile Acquisition Strategy to include concept exploration for an MQ-9 follow-on.\n2. MQ-9 Development and Fielding. This effort is for development and fielding of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft and GCSs and associated communications systems, sensors, payloads, simulators, support equipment, and resolving Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.\n3. Squadron Operations Centers (SOC). This effort is for development and fielding of standardized operations centers. SOCs contain the equipment necessary for remote split operations, to provide mission data and tasking information to aircrew, and to disseminate and\/or exchange mission data with decision-makers and the intelligence community.\n4. MQ-9 Upgrade. This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using an Agile Acquisition Strategy.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, Ground Control Station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data\/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed in a plug-and-play mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and GCS configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.\n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties. The aircraft is designed to primarily prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) using a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Electro-optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill weapon capability (hunter-killer). It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).\n\nThe MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capabilities to meet evolving mission needs through incremental upgrades, including but not limited to, increasing the maximum gross takeoff and landing weight; increasing operational range and endurance; propulsion system improvements; integrated redundant avionics; incorporating provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; communications upgrades to include but not limited to datalink encryption, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, secure voice and data communications; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; sensor\/stores management computer improvement; MIL STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); software updates needed to support new configurations and development; integrating additional precision weapons; and hardware and software upgrades to the GCS.  The program will also complete airworthiness and weapon system certification and accreditation; produce applicable training for payloads funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF), Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons). Development efforts will address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), and safety issues. Activities also include, but are not limited to, trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.\n\nThe GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support reach back Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; and enable personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status. It incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions. Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) is used for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within LOS range of the LRGCS. GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to other MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance\/certification and accreditation requirements. \n\nThis project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools. \n\nMQ-9 Program of Record (PoR) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will cost share during development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.\n\nFunding may be used to address DMS and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) issues.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

L3Comm is the prime contractor for the Predator Satellite Link. Raytheon is the prime contractor for the MTS-B EO\/IR sensor system. Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through an acquisition strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process. This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide."

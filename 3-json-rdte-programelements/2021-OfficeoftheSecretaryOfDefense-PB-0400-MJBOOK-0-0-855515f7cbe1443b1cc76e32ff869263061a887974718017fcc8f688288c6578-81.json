            "val": "The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, responsible for the research, development, and prototyping activities across the DoD enterprise. In this capacity, OUSD(R&E) conducts analyses and studies; develops policies; provides technical leadership, oversight and advice; and issues guidance for Department of Defense (DoD) RDT&E programs. This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the USD(R&E) (OUSD(R&E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&E program and its impacts to the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts. Such activities include: (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  \n\nThe PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the USD(R&E).  The Defense Laboratory Office mission is to craft policy and provide the oversight necessary to both preserve current and develop future DoD in-house laboratory capability such that they continue to generate mission-critical innovations that increase the U.S. military advantage and enhance U.S. national security.  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and supports the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) personnel and quality of workforce; and (3) technology transfer.\n\nThe PE provides funding for engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the USD(R&E) in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&T) program and to ensure that the technology being developed is affordable and helps minimize system development risk.  \n\nBeginning in FY 2021, the PE will also fund research and technical analysis and management, under the direction of the newly created Director of Defense Research and Engineering for Modernization. These investments will promote further prioritization and targeting of the Department's key investments across the modernization efforts.\n\nBeginning in FY 2021, this PE will also fund Homeland Defense Capabilities Development Initiatives to address technology application in support of homeland defense of our military installations and the surrounding areas."

Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department, and is critical to preserving intellectual property and competitive capabilities of our national industrial base. To maintain full confidence in our systems, the Department must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities. DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result\nin the loss of this information. These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary. The Department must take steps to understand the impacts of losses and rethink how we safeguard our capabilities. This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production, and component manufacturing.\n\nThis project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information, and an analysis of losses, to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action."

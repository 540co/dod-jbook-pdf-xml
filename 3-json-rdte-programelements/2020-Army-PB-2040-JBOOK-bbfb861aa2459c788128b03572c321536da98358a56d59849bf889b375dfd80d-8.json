The synergy between these embedded training capabilities and the immersive training advanced technology development in Project S28 provides Army units with a set of complementary embedded as well as deploy-on-demand systems that provide just-in-time, dynamic, realistic training, and mission rehearsal capabilities. Demonstrations include technologies that form a framework for future training applications for the range of future force operations such as robotic control and other sensor operations; mission planning and rehearsal; maneuver; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network analysis to support distributed simulations; and vehicle system interface requirements. This Project creates a joint environment by synchronizing virtual and constructive simulated forces with the next generation and current training systems from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps forces.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities."

This provides a unifying M&S architecture that synchronizes and integrates multi-resolution modeling applications such as Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) experimentation. This effort focuses on researching cutting-edge M&S methods to enable the Army and the Department of Defense (DoD) to perform critical System of Systems (SoS) analysis, experimentation, technology tradeoffs, capability assessments, concept development, and training that saves time and resources while increasing the effectiveness of acquisition and training activities.  \n\nEfforts in this Project support the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering S&T priorities and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nFY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities."

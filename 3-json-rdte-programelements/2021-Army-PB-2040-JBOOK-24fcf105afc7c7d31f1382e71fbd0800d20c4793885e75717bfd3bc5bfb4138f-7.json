The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication\/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging. Continuing funding will provide hardware and software development, training material development, as well as developmental and operational testing.\n\nMEDEVAC:\nBeginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, Research Development Technology & Evaluation (RDT&E) funding will also support non-recurring engineering to integrate and qualify MEDEVAC Mission Equipment Package (MEP) into the UH-60V Black Hawk helicopter.  This MEDEVAC MEP integration effort is independent of the UH-60V Program of Record and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB).  The Surgeon General (TSG) has a requirement for a MEDEVAC capability provided by Black Hawk helicopters that were not initially produced for MEDEVAC, but are designated to support the MEDEVAC mission. In accordance with AR 40-60 Medical Materiel Acquisition Policy, the Program Executive Office for Aviation (PEOAVN) is responsible for the costs associated with medical MEP integration on Black Hawk helicopters that were not initially produced for MEDEVAC, but require medical MEP modifications\/upgrades to support the MEDEVAC mission.  MEDEVAC MEP integration on the UH-60V will address obsolescence and reduce the logistics footprint by increasing equipment commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet and will reduce the number of Black Hawk MEDEVAC configurations.  Additionally, UH-60V MEDEVAC capabilities will increase when comparing MEDEVAC MEP integration on legacy Black Hawk helicopters.  Capability improvements will include simultaneous Rescue Hoist and extended range capability, enabled MEDEVAC Mission Sensor (MMS) use in Arctic conditions, UH-60V Multi-Function Display (MFD) integrated MMS video, and Multi-Function Controller Unit (MFCU) integration of MMS functions.\n\nIndependent of the UH-60V Program of Record and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), incremental RDT&E funding to support integration of a MEDEVAC capability on UH-60V is planned for FY 2019-2022.  In accordance with AR 40-60, Medical Materiel Acquisition Policy, the Army's Aeromedical Evacuation capability is funded by two portfolio managers, PEOAVN and the Medical Research Development Command, MRDC.  PEOAVN is responsible for the integration of MEDEVAC MEP on the UH-60V.  MRDC is responsible for recurring costs to procure kits and resource the installation of MEP kits on UH-60V MEDEVAC helicopters.\n\nSATCOM:\nDevelopment and Integration of an airworthiness satellite communications for better coordination, information sharing and situational awareness\/situational understanding on UH\/HH-60 aircraft."

S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Aviation and Missile Center (AvMC) and PIF to design and integrate MEDEVAC capability into the UH-60V.  By leveraging the same GOGO facility utilized by the UH-60V program, efficient design, software development, integration, and testing will occur by eliminating redundant tasks and employing experienced government resources already in possession of pertinent UH-60V technical data required to support the MEDEVAC MEP non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort.  Prototype, validation, and verification of technical publications, as well as airworthiness testing will be accomplished following completion of the UH-60V IOT&E, at which time up to two UH-60V EDM aircraft will be allocated to the MEDEVAC MEP program.  Following completion of MEDEVAC MEP NRE, technical products will feed production and fielding contracts, which will be resourced by the U.S. Army Medical Department, AMEDD.

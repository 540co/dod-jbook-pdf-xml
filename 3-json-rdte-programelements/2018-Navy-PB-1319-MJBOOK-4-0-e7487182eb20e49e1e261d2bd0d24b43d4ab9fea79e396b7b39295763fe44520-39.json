This baseline will enable MCISRE analysts to deliver tactically focused, operational and strategic intelligence at the tactical edge throughout all phases of operations and will provide relevant, precise decision support for Joint Task Force (JTF), Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), and subordinate Marine units.   The DoD DCGS Enterprise provides worldwide garrison, and forward projection of tactical ISR capabilities at the JTF level and below.  The DoD DCGS Enterprise enhances intelligence sharing within the Joint Services, the Intelligence Community, and Coalition Forces throughout all phases of operations.  Each individual Military Service DCGS Program of Record provides unique and distinct capabilities to the overall DoD DCGS Enterprise.  DCGS-MC GEOINT consists of GEOINT Imagery and Topographic Capability, Enterprise DCGS Integration Backbone System (EDS), Virtual Imagery Processing - Marine Corps (VIP-MC), Target Material Production (TMP) Full Motion Video Optical Navigation Exploitation (FMV-ONE), and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) systems. These capabilities will provide the USMC GEOINT analysts with the capability to process, disseminate, exploit, analyze and produce intelligence.  Future capabilities will be delivered via clearly defined Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).

Funding also addresses Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) requirements, including initiation and test efforts for approximately 35 Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG) and 18 Topographic Production Capability (TPC) assets in support of JSF squadrons in order to capture increased data sensing capability with newer aviation platforms. Funding will be used to support the integration of Commercial Joint Mapping Toolkit (CJMTK) Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) Portal to price data sharing and data management capability across\nMarine Expeditionary Forces\/Intelligence (INTEL) Battalions and MCISRE Network architectures. Additionally, funds\nwill support integration and test efforts associated with geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) and imagery hardware refreshes of current fielded assets and testing and cyber security certification of National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's (NGA) iSTORE Software into the DCGC-MC Programs of Record (PoR). Specifically for EDS, intent is to provide an Enhanced Directory Monitor, Optical Character Recognition, Acronym Finder, Geospatial Extraction, and Metadata Entry Automation capability software enhancements. DCGS-MC will be multi-network capable, able to integrate with Intelligence databases and elements of the DoD DCGS Enterprise on JWICS and Coalition networks."

Funding also addresses Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) requirements, including initiation and test efforts for approximately 35 Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG) and 18 Topographic Production Capability (TPC) assets in support of JSF squadrons in order to capture increased data sensing capability with newer aviation platforms.  Funding will be used to support the integration of Commercial Joint Mapping Toolkit (CJMTK) Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) Portal to price data sharing and data management capability across Marine Expeditionary Forces\/Intelligence (INTEL) Battalions and MCISRE Network architectures. Additionally, funds will support integration and test efforts associated with geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) and imagery hardware refreshes of current fielded assets and testing and cyber security certification of National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's (NGA) iSTORE Software into the DCGC-MC Programs of Record (PoR). Specifically for EDS, intent is to provide an Enhanced Directory Monitor, Optical Character Recognition, Acronym Finder, Geospatial Extraction, and Metadata Entry Automation capability software enhancements. DCGS-MC will be multi-network capable, able to integrate with Intelligence databases and elements of the DoD DCGS Enterprise on JWICS and Coalition networks.  The benefits of obtaining this for USMC are enhanced Intelligence sharing and fusion, greater awareness in the Joint\/Coalition Environment, and contributes directly to the Joint Processing Exploitation Dissemination (JPED) effort."

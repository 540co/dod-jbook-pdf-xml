FY2018 funding for C-130H AMP Increment 2 was also reduced by $66.800M to adjust to the approved FY17 Program Office Estimate.\n\nThe C-130H is a medium sized tactical transport aircraft providing multi-purpose theater support throughout the globe.  The C-130H fleet supports several diverse Air Force roles, including but not limited to tactical and inter-theater airlift and airdrop support, Arctic resupply, special operations support, aeromedical evacuation, aerial spraying, firefighting duties, and natural disaster and humanitarian relief missions.\n\nC-130H AMP Increment 1 addresses modifications to meet airspace compliance mandates and safety requirements.  RDT&E efforts will cover design, integration,developmental and operational test, trial kit buy and installation, Initial Spares, Peculiar Support Equipment, Type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.\n\nC-130H AMP Increment 2 includes digital avionics upgrades (e.g. Flight Management System, improved navigation), cockpit modernization (e.g.\nglass\/engine flight displays) and resolves select obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues.  RDT&E efforts will cover software development,design, integration, developmental and operational test, trial kit buy and installation, technical order development validation and verification, Initial Spares, Peculiar Support Equipment, SIL development, Type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) issues will be resolved with solutions that may include life of type buys or bridge buys. DMS efforts to include removal of end of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nThe C-130H AMP Increment 1 program modifies 176 aircraft (170x C-130Hs and 6x LC-130Hs) consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s and H1s; and includes 131 Air National Guard aircraft, and 45 Air Force Reserve aircraft. Potential of up to an additional 4 production kits (not included in the funding line) for National Science Foundation aircraft. The modification effort will have up to 6 prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the C-130H AMP Increment 1 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. The remaining aircraft will be modified in the production phase."

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and\nStandards(SCARS)initiative.\n\nRDT&E efforts include but are not limited to software development, design, integration, developmental & operational test, trial kit buy and installation, technical order development validation and verification, Peculiar Support Equipment, Initial Spares, SIL development, Type 1 training, and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.\n\nThe C-130H AMP Increment 2 program modifies a minimum of 176 aircraft (170x C-130Hs and 6x LC-130Hs) consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s and H1s; and includes 131 Air National Guard aircraft, and 45 Air Force Reserve aircraft.  Potential of an additional 4 production kits (not included in funding line above); for National Science Foundation aircraft. The modification effort will have up to 8 prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  The remaining aircraft will be modified in the production phase."

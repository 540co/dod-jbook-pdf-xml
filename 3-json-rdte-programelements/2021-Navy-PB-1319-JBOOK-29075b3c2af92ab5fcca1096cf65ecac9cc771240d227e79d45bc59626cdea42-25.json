The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) continue the Applied Research work in PE 0602792N for promising INPs with Advanced Technology Development activities. INP investments define the future of U.S. naval forces. Due to high technical risk, INPs often have long trial-and-error timeframes to work through challenges, but typically no more than three years between decision points. INP efforts mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require applied and advanced technology development funding to bridge from concept to working prototype. INPs prove technological and capability potential, validate production feasibility, and acquisition potential. ONR demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to a new acquisition programs. INPs are selected by senior leadership in the Department of the Navy. \n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and\/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system\/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).\n\n\nBecause to the nature of these projects described, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.

This multi-year effort will build a Railgun Weapon System (RGWS) by designing, fabricating and integrating EMRG subsystems and components into a weapon system that brings new capabilities, increased capacity and improved operational economy to fleet operations at sea. With its increased velocity and extended range, EMRG provides multi-mission potential for hypersonic missile defense, anti-air & surface warfare, and naval surface fire support. The Activity identified in Project Unit 2481 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the EMRG high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

This multi-year effort will build a Railgun Weapon System (RGWS) by designing, fabricating and integrating EMRG subsystems and components into a weapon system that brings new capabilities, increased capacity and improved operational economy to fleet operations at sea. With its increased velocity and extended range, EMRG provides multi-mission potential for hypersonic missile defense, anti-air & surface warfare, and naval surface fire support."

The High Energy Laser Counter ASCM Project HELCAP will assess, develop, experiment, and demonstrate the various laser weapon system technologies and methods of implementation required to defeat ASCMs.\n\nHELCAP will leverage the knowledge gained in the Navy Laser Family of Systems (NLFoS) efforts that include:\n- Alternative Laser Sources for higher powers, also known as the Ruggedized High Energy Laser (RHEL) activities;\n- Solid State Laser Tech Maturation activities that provides initial key enabling technical solutions in high power lasers and beam control, and will provide opportunities for single ship operational and sustainment learning;\n- Surface Navy Laser Weapon System Increment 1 (SNLWS Inc. 1) project that provides the initial combat system integration and installation knowledge for Aegis platforms, and multi-ship battle force operations knowledge;\n- Optical Dazzling Interdictor Navy (ODIN) that provides Counter-ISR technical and fleet operational knowledge.\nThis leveraged knowledge and new HELCAP technical solutions to the C-ASCM problem will enable a fully informed decision to rapidly field an integrated, fleet ready, HEL Weapon.\n\nHELCAP activities being conducted in this project include technology assessments, laser lethality investigations, and advanced beam control. This project passes technology to follow on HELCAP activities being conducted under Program Element (PE) 0603925N Directed Energy and Electric Weapon Systems.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

Potential adversaries are investing in advanced technologies that will challenge our advantages in the critical information domain. Nation states and non-state actors seek to degrade our command and control capabilities, networks and computer systems. Cyber threats continue to grow and rapidly proliferate. Technologies developed in this Project will enable the warfighter to take immediate, appropriate action at any time against any desired adversary, target or network by assuring that autonomous, continuous analyses of intelligence, persistent surveillance and open information sources have, at all times, optimized the possible courses of action based on commander's guidance. Technologies within this activity will foster operational endurance and enable sustained operations and resiliency for warfighters and platforms through enhanced cyber security\/protection.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. INP investments do not necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases, but they do have the goal of moving into the acquisition process within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA2 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans.

This Arctic Mobile Observing System (AMOS) will operate via a sea ice-based buoy that enables the critical infrastructure necessary to support persistent sensing at a lower cost and with less risk than deploying manned platforms in the Arctic. Activities include buoy node construction and testing, software development, vehicle acquisition, and Arctic-hardening of sensors and platforms. The project includes domain-specific engineering development, upgrading UUV platform designs for the Arctic environment, developing the power and communication buoy node for the Arctic domain, incorporating mature and maturing UUV sensing capabilities into vehicles and ensure suitability for Arctic operations. The project will also develop under-ice CONOPS for the autonomous UUV network, building on capabilities developed under previous efforts for vehicle autonomy, re-charging, sensing, communication, and Command, Control, Communication & Computers (C4I), and develop new capabilities for operating under sea ice. A key thrust will be to enable an under-ice acoustic navigation system for unmanned platforms, suitable for use in any GPS-denied operational area."

It expands the competitive space in the electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt, degrade, and destroy critical electronic targets. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3416 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the HIJENKS INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans.

LOCUST will provide ISR and precision loitering munitions capable of being launched from air, surface, ground, and sub-surface platforms to conduct both singular and swarm operations across battlespace in conjunction with Joint and manned operations. It will demonstrate multi-domain launch and strike operations, heterogeneous air platform payloads, unmanned from unmanned operations, distributed control of the strike mission, and refined cost elements for critical technologies that have supply chain assurance addressed. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3423 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the LOCUST INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

AMOS is a mobile observing system of systems node that enables 2-way communications, under-ice vehicle navigation, and extended-duration autonomy in the complex Arctic environment. AMOS will provide a persistent, mobile, autonomous capability to monitor the operational environment and maritime operations of potential adversaries in the Arctic Ocean. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3450 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the AMOS INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

CLAWS will deliver algorithms to enable all families of UUVs to operate in complex, dynamic and degraded environments. CLAWS will demonstrate autonomous missions in denied waters, develop and demonstrate autonomous technologies for survivability of large UUVs, and develop autonomy and launch capabilities for special mission payloads. CLAWS will be able to complete missions 1&2 against near peer adversary defenses, maintain critical communication with Navy C2\/Fires and provide critical ISR information. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3451 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the CLAWS INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

ELEKTRA will demonstrate AI\/ML ability to coordinate kinetic\/non kinetic effects autonomously with heterogeneous platforms, the ability to operate in degraded environments for hours and the ability to coordinate and execute domain kill chains simultaneously. It will deploy artificial intelligent (AI) and machine learning (ML) architecture, neural networked computing and large data handling to enable real time, force level effects assignment, coordination and resource management. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3452 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the ELEKTRA INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

Hypersonic Booster will develop a CVN-capable HAWC AUR for air-launched flight demonstration that will require a 25% reduction in overall length to enable fitment in CVN weapons elevators). The goal from the outset will be to leverage DARPA-developed HAWC program for naval applications. It will flight test a CVN compliant, Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) All-Up-Round (AUR) to demonstrate airframe and booster propulsion technologies. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3453 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the Hypersonic Booster INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

MDUSVs capable of deployed blue-water operations with operator trust in safe, reliable operation, long-range and endurance autonomous operations. This will create a new paradigm for Navy surface force, a hybrid manned\/unmanned force, and enable new tactics in performing naval missions. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3454 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the MDUSV INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

It will establish a DevOps environment that includes warfighter staffs in the development and integration of new capabilities. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3455 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the MINERVA INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

This Advanced Technology Development, in coordination with a complimentary Applied Research investment in Program Element (PE) 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res, will create an overall capability for LRT. Technologies within this activity will enable integrated and distributed forces capable of dynamic synchronized actions. Investments include technologies for sense and sense making and Artificial Intelligence for predictive mission-focused analytics that autonomously gather, analyze, compile, interpret, and visualize a fused tactical and national all source data picture to improve planning and decision making speeds. Investments will also establish a distributed Artificial Intelligence capability that can function in a harsh and adversarial environment, determine an optimal response and react in real-time. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3457 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the LRT INP effort.\n\nINP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nInformation security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

It will consist of the employment of sustainable large-scale robotic swarm warfare across all domains ahead of our adversaries to obviate costly and vulnerable legacy platforms and to gain a competitive advantage."

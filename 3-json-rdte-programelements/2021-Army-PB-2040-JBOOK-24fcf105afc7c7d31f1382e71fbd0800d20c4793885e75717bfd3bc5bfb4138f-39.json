The requirement for IBS is documented in the Integrated SIGINT Information Mission Needs Statement (MNS) validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Memo (JROCM) 115-95 on 15 September 1995. The JTT program is an effort to provide common tactical terminals capable of receiving and transmitting into the IBS UHF broadcasts. The House Permanent Select Committee for Intelligence (HPSCI) requested an IBS Implementation Plan, which was approved by the Assistant Secretary for Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD\/C3I) (ref (i)) on 24 October 1995. The JTT was included as part of the solution in the Implementation Plan.  The JTT program Operational Requirements Document (ORD) was signed on 24 September 1996.  Subsequent updates in March 2005 and November 2017 were made to reflect changes in interoperability\/Net Readiness certifications and Post Milestone C enhancements respectively.  Additional fact of life administrative changes were made and the updated ORD was signed on 25 April 2018.  The JTT is integrated into platforms that have a requirement to interact (transmit and\/or receive) with the IBS Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB).  JTT is a post-Milestone C program. The legacy IBS Terminals will reach sustainment end-of-life in FY2025.  The procurement of a post-Milestone C replacement was initiated to replace the end-of-life systems, leverage updated technology, and enable flexible configurations to meet Joint customer operational needs. The procurement for a modernized Non-Developmental Item terminal will access multiple vendors by leveraging competitively awarded contracts."

            "val": "The Defense Rapid Innovation Program (RIP) was established in Section 1073 of the FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and authorized as a permanent program in the FY 2017 NDAA.  Section 224 of the FY 2019 NDAA codified the RIP in the U.S. Code as Title 10, Section 2359a (TAB B).  The RIP accelerates the fielding of innovative technologies into military systems via a competitive, merit-based selection process.  Technology innovations are drawn from Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) projects, defense laboratory and academia efforts, and other innovative technologies, including dual-use and Independent Research & Development (IRAD) technologies.  Projects stimulate innovation, mitigate technical risks, reduce acquisition and\/or lifecycle costs, improve test outcomes, and rapidly insert technology into major acquisition programs and other programs that meet critical national security needs.  RIP provides a mechanism for bridging the \u201cValley of Death\u201d by funding the integration work vital to transition technologies out of the laboratory and into Programs of Record.  Since inception, RIP has evaluated over 20,000 industry submitted white papers by companies from all 50 states and funded over 900 projects across 26 different organizations in the Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other Defense Agencies."

Industry participants are invited to submit a three-page white paper plus a quad chart through an annual Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Once white papers are reviewed, the highest ranking white papers are invited to submit full detailed proposals for funding consideration.  In ranking white papers, preference is given to projects focusing on the Research and Engineering top 10 research priorities, the National Defense Strategy, and small businesses.  Full proposals are subject to final review and the highest ranking proposals are selected for contract award.  The statute for RIP defines project scope as not to exceed 24 months and $3.000 million per project."

            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates capabilities that enable sustainment, increase the affordability and reliability of manufacturing, and enhance Airman and weapon system performance and effectiveness to provide compelling advantage to the warfighter.  Advances to technologies and materials under this program reduce life cycle costs; ensure the industrial base for Air Force systems; boost quality, increase readiness, and improve safety, survivability, and operability of weapon systems; predict, evaluate, and mitigate bioeffects on personnel and mission performance; and enable airmen performance.  \n\nTo the greatest extent practical, integrated technology demonstrations will utilize modeling and simulation, cross-discipline system integration (e.g., platforms, avionics, propulsion, materials, manufacturing, human performance, cybersecurity, and counter directed energy weapons) to demonstrate in a near-operational environment advanced science and technology capabilities that reduce operational risk and accelerate incorporation of technologies into existing and future operational systems.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the Secretary of the Air Force in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603112F, Advanced Materials for Weapon Systems, and associated Projects will be transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos, with the exception of the Pervasive and Affordable Metals Technologies effort which will be transferred to PE 0602102F, Materials, Project 624347, Materials for Structures, Propulsion, and Subsystems.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603199F, Sustainment Science and Technology (S&T), and associated Projects\/activities are transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603680F, Manufacturing Technology Program, and associated Projects\/Activities are transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635323, Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters; and Project 635324, Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration, are transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 060303F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos. \n\nThese transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. \n\nThe Air Force Science and Technology portfolio will continued to be managed at the Enterprise level by the Air Force Technology Executive Officer, dual-hatted as the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Commander, and executed across the various AFRL Technology Directorates and locations.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

Equally important is assuring manufacturing quality, integrity, and safety requirements are built in.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633153, Non-Destructive Inspection Development, is transferred from PE 0603112F, Advanced Materials for Weapon Systems, to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos, Project 633153, Non-Destructive Inspection Development, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

The Project develops and improves manufacturing technologies and processes to enable cost reduction, improve component and system quality, and enhance industrial capability.  Value stream modifications and manufacturing throughput improvements are effected to shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production and sustainment.  Manufacturing Technologies objectives are conducted through industrial partnerships which enable the demonstration of manufacturing technologies for existing weapon system upgrades and\/or for new warfighter systems.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635280, Manufacturing Technologies, is transferred from PE 0603680F, Manufacturing Technology Program, to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos, Project 635280, Manufacturing Technologies, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Technologies matured and demonstrated impact affordability and availability of fielded aerospace weapon systems by reducing sustainment costs, extending service life, and maintaining  mission readiness and capability. This program develops and demonstrates maintenance, life cycle management, and system\/fleet decision making technologies that can be implemented to address operational sustainment issues and could influence future system sustainability decisions via risk reduction to support inclusion into new systems. Studies are conducted to analyze processes and methodologies for application of technologies to address sustainment issues across the force, identifying cross cutting applications for fielded systems, and opportunities for building in sustainability into future applications. This program also develops and demonstrates affordable advanced composites for aircraft structures of fielded and emerging systems.  This includes studies, analysis, and tests for application of composites to address sustainment and affordability issues across the force. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635351, Technology Sustainment, is transferred from PE 0603199F, Sustainment Science and Technology (S&T), to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos, Project 635351, Technology Sustainment, as part of the Air Force RDT&EBA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

PrSM provides an open system architecture that facilitates future growth. PrSM provides responsive engagement of high value point and area targets by Army and Joint Force Commanders under all weather conditions, at operational ranges defended by enemy air-defense systems. An AoA supporting the MS A decision was completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with an OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015. In 4QFY16, the Army awarded 9 month risk reduction, trade study and initial design development agreements to two contractors. The effort resulted in development of initial baseline designs presented during final technical reviews that resulted in a seamless transition into the TMRR phase. Subsequent to MS A approval on 31 March 2017, the Army awarded TMRR agreements to two contractors. TMRR is ongoing and includes risk reduction activities and further maturation of contractor design concepts. Both contractors participated in a PDR in 1QFY19 and have begun to receive hardware for assembling four (4) system level missile prototypes culminating in flight tests to provide demonstration of their system capabilities.\n\nIn FY18, the Army directed acceleration of PrSM capability in response to immediate near-peer threats and the requirement to engage targets with a precision guided missile out to 499km. As a result, the program was restructured to conduct the following key activities previously not planned for in TMRR: finalize tactical designs, build additional missiles for system level Engineering Development Testing (EDT) flight tests, and establish a production capability. This approach allows the Army to reduce program risk, make a more informed down-select decision at EMD, and accelerate an early capability. Component and system level testing will inform contractor down-select at EMD. \n\nThe EMD phase will complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E)."

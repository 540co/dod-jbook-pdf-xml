The system will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM defeat mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms.\n\nFY 2018 Base dollars in the amount of $175.069 million are designated for the fabrication and delivery of EMD Assets #1-6, program management\/administration, system engineering, hardware and software integration, additional spares and system\/subsystem developmental testing."

The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will conduct MML qualification testing and will conduct publication validation and verification, training, logistics demonstration, developmental flight testing, support a cyber security assessment, and initiate MML Production Technical Data Package (TDP) independent assessment. The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will support a Technology Readiness Assessment and receive results from the MML Production TDP assessment to support the Limited User Test, Milestone C, and the Low Rate Initial Production Decision.  The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office has modified its Acquisition Strategy by transferring four MML assets, originally designated as part of LRIP, to be test articles for use in IOT&E and other developmental test activities, as required. \n\nThe IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will fund AMRDEC to integrate IFPC Inc 2-I software into the IBCS v4.0 baseline to support the Limited User Test, continue component qualification testing, order materials for MML EMD assets, assemble two MML assets, and support software integration, test and checkout activities in the I2 Lab. \n\nThe IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will fund LEAD to fabricate components, assemble, and deliver the ten remaining MML assets."

Project 232 focuses on affordable delivery of scalable (lethal to non-lethal) effects for weapons and munitions including: artillery, mortars, medium caliber, tank fired, Soldier weapons and shoulder fired weapons. Project L96 matures and integrates critical high energy laser subsystems into a mobile demonstrator to explore and validate system performance in relevant environments. Project L97 demonstrates performance of advanced obscurants and delivery of mechanisms and conducts forensic analysis of explosives and hazardous materials to enable detection.  \n\nWork in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with, PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602307A (Advanced Weapons Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke, and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603008A (Electronic Warfare Advanced Technology), and PE 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology).\n  \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n  \nWork in this PE is performed by the Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ; Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Edgewood, MD; and the Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), Huntsville, AL."

Concepts such as a unitary projectile geared towards medium armor targets, a full bore submunition with a highly reliable triple function fuze, a concept that increases the size and fuze volume of the Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) bomblet and incorporates high reliability fuzing while maintaining the traditional lethal mechanisms of DPICM. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the efforts optimize the concept of bomblet\/system design and component space allocation to accommodate system level development and demonstrating concept performance through modeling and simulation. Efforts mature system level designs of unitary solutions and improve initial system level performance. Efforts continue to mature designs and exploit alternate technologies to mitigate risk; develop evaluation criteria to assess concept performance; integrate component technologies into system level solution that are effective against target sets."

The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  At entry level weapon power of around 10 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat small caliber mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), surface mines, sensors, and optics.  At full weapon system power levels of around 100 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, cruise missiles, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor\/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n \nWork is performed by the Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)\/Army Forces Strategic Command, Technical Center, Huntsville, AL."

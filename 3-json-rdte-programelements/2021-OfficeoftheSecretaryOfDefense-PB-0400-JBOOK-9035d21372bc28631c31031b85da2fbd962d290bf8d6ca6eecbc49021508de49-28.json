This PE provides policy oversight and guidance for distributed learning (e.g., online courses, smartphone-based learning, web browser\u2013based simulations) and supports associated modernization and coordination across DoD, coalition partners (e.g., NATO), and other federal agencies. This PE helps DoD and its partners maintain modern and interoperable digital learning systems for delivering training and education anytime and anywhere at scale. This program was originally established in 1997 in response to the NDAA (FY99, Section 378 of Public Law 105-261) and granted additional authorities via Executive Orders (e.g., EO 13111) and other supporting publications (e.g., 10 U.S. Code \u00a72249d). \n\nThis PE\u2019s work falls into three interrelated categories: (1) Modernization, (2) Documentation, and (3) Coordination. The modernization work involves Advanced Technology Development in technical areas such as digital learning systems interoperability, learning analytics, and learning science for delivery at scale. These efforts inform the PE\u2019s documentation work, including the authoring and upkeep of technical guidance and policy documents such as DoD Instruction 1322.26 (\u201cDistributed Learning\u201d) and software interoperability specifications. Finally, coordination efforts consist of implementation support and interagency\/interorganizational coordination. \n\nThis PE\u2019s modernization investments are driven by requirements collected from the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, a working group that represents agencies\u2019 distributed learning equities (refer to DoDI 1322.26). These requirements are also aligned to DoD\/federal strategic direction, such as the DoD Chief Management Officer\u2019s Digital Learning Modernization reform, Army Learning Strategy, Navy\u2019s Sailor 2025, and Air Force Strategic Master Plan. \n\nThis PE benefits DoD in three ways. (1) Interoperability: It strengthens interagency, interorganizational, and multinational interoperability by governing distributed learning interoperability policy, maintaining current technical reference guidelines, and fostering their implementation across communities of practice. (2) Efficiencies: It saves government resources by fostering unity of effort across DoD, other federal agencies, and coalition partners for distributed learning, eliminating duplications and identifying opportunities for interagency collaboration. (3) Learning Effectiveness: It helps improve training and education effectiveness by helping DoD, federal, and coalition stakeholders acquire and implement digital learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiently. In sum, this work supports DoD Components\u2019 training and education missions, helping them increase personnel readiness while driving down training and education portfolio costs."

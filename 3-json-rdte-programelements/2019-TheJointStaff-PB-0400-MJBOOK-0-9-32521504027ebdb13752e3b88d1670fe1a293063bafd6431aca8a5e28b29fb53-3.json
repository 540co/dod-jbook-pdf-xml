JIOR supports Presidential policy and CJCS mandates for training, certification, and recertification of 6000+ cyber mission forces and DoD\/Interagency cyber vulnerability assessments.  The JIOR security construct allows users to develop, test, and secure their military capabilities and protect their identity and capabilities during range activities.

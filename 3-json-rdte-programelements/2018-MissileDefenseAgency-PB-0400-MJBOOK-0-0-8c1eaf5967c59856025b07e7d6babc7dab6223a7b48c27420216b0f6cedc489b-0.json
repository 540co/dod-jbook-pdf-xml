Delivering insight into the performance of proposed concepts extends MDA's ability to address evolving threats for the warfighter.\n\nSubject matter experts provide independent assessments of government, university, and industry technology concepts, used in concert with systems engineering requirements to support acquisition strategy decisions and define technology focus areas.  The innovative structured concept definition and assessment methodology enables the MDA to quickly validate focus areas, verify contractor technology solutions, and evaluate promising concepts in future Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) architectures.   This methodology significantly enhances MDA's ability to assess technology concepts while decreasing the cost of development through:\n- Independent model-based simulations of industry technology concepts to inform the systems engineering process\n- Digital simulation and hardware-in-the-loop performance assessments of algorithms and hardware concepts prior to expensive live fire test events\n- End-to-end testing of technology concepts integrated with weapon systems and Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications \n\nPerformance assessment of advanced concepts incorporates Better Buying Power philosophy in the earliest stages of technology development to maximize technology investments with minimal investment. Performance assessment supports evaluation and analysis of capabilities for both right and left of launch."

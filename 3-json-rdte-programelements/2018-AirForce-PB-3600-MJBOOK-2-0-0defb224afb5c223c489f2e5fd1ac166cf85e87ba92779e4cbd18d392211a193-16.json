Funding may be used to modernize these, and other, NC3 systems.  Funding may also be used for research, testing, validation, certification, configuration management, and assessment of the Air Force NC3 Weapon System.   \n\nSACCS is a dedicated, high speed, multi-level secure, data transmission, processing, and display system. SACCS provides the primary non-survivable command and control capability for receiving and disseminating secure Emergency Action Messages (EAM), Force Direction Messages (FDM), Force Status Reporting (FSR), and exchanging information type messages from USSTRATCOM. SACCS provides messages for effective deployment of strategic bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, mobilization aircraft, tanker support aircraft, and the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force.   \n\nSACCS has equipment that has reached its end of life and is no longer repairable due to diminished manufacturing sources and parts obsolescence. This jeopardizes Air Force Global Strike Command's (AFGSC) ability to meet mission requirements as required by Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Nuclear Technical Performance Criteria and Operational Standards (CJCSI 6811.01). In order to mitigate the risk of SACCS inability to operate once the current spares are completely diminished, and ensure the system remains secure against modern\/future threats, the Air Force is developing a replacement system.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years."

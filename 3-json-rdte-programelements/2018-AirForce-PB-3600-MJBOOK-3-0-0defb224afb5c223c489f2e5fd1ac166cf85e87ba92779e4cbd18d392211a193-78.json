        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three dimensional positioning\/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real  time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures that continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC Sec. 50112 which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.\n\nThe system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under PE 1203164F), Space (funded under this PE and PE 1203165F) and a Control Network (funded under PE 1203165F and PE 1203423F).  The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.\n\nGPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) to join the GPS constellation. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo- compatible signal, and enhanced anti-jam power. Two auxiliary payloads, Search and Rescue\/GPS (SAR\/GPS) and Laser Retro-reflector Array (LRA) will be added no earlier than SV11. The SAR\/GPS payload provided by Canada will fill a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. LRA, built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL), is a passive reflector that will improve accuracy and provide better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of the LRA.\n\nThis program funds GPS III and supports research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) of GPS III SV01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This PE includes SV01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and Allied use of GPS.\n\nThe program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as risk mitigation to late Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) delivery. COps will fly GPS III SVs to be brought into the operational constellation, sustaining current levels of performance and avoiding degradation. The current acquisition schedule of OCX Block 1 (capability to operate GPS III satellites) puts GPS constellation sustainment at risk since the current control segment cannot operate GPS III satellites. GPS III COps is a modification to the current control segment to operate GPS III satellites' PNT and NUDET Detection System (NDS) and maintain limited test M-Code capability until OCX Block 1 is delivered.\n\nOn 3 July 2015, USD(AT&L) approved the first phase of a two-phased GPS III SV acquisition strategy starting no earlier than SV11. Phase 1 is a Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment which will provide data and insight into contractors' GPS III Production Design with emphasis on a mature navigation payload to include a regional M-Code capability that is consistent with the GPS Enterprise Analysis of Alternatives (AOA). Phase 1 utilizes FY2015-2018 RDTE funding for up to three contractors' GPS production designs. Phase 2 has not been approved and options continue to be explored. Notionally, Phase 2 will be a full and open competition for up to 22 GPS III SVs with an expected decision no earlier than SV11. Phase 2 is funded via Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF) in PE 1203265F, BPAC: 23GPS3.\n\nSpace Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses obsolescence, future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. Phase 1 will address GPS Enterprise AoA recommendations to increase GPS signal strength from space by maturing navigation payload technologies that include a new regional M-Code capability. The Air Force is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator which will provide signal flexibility (to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit). This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Lab\u2019s Science & Technology (S&T) funding and PE 1203265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payload awards.\n\nMission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures, and procurement of special support equipment.\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchase to M-Code capable receivers starting in FY17. The funds will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with updating the legacy GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with the Next Generation Operational Control Segment (OCX), supports Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.\nImpacts of the M-Code deployment include:\t\n- Compliance with AFSPC\/CC mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for Early M-Code Operational Use and verification of Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR)effects.\n- Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.\n- Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and deployed properly.\n- Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE\/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding\n\nThe FY 2018 funding request was reduced by $35.000 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nIn FY 2018, BPAC 67A011, Space Analysis Application Development M-Code Hosted Payload includes new start efforts.\n\nThis program is a Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The implementation of a US Medium Earth Orbiting (MEO) Search and Rescue Space Segment is via a Canadian-provided 406 MHz SAR repeater on GPS III SVs. This system presents a cost effective, low-risk opportunity that accommodates existing and planned 406 MHz beacons across the globe. Per National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-39, USAF and USCG, the US operators of the civil Cosmicheskaya Sistyema Poiska Avariynich Sudov-Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (COSPAS\/SARSAT) system and the international search and rescue system will integrate the Canadian-provided SAR repeater into GPS III beginning no earlier than SV11."

GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and a growth path to full warfighter capabilities. GPS III SV03-10 is in the Production & Deployment Phase.\n\nRDT&E, AF PE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports research, development, test and evaluation of GPS III SV01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This PE includes SV01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) delivery.\n\nSpace Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. Phase 1 will address GPS Enterprise Analysis of Alternative (AoA) recommendations to increase GPS signal strength from space by maturing navigation payload technologies that include a new regional M-Code capability. The Air Force is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which will provide signal flexibility (to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit). This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Lab\u2019s Science & Technology (S&T) funding and PE 1203265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads.\n\nMission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures, and procurement of special support equipment. \n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchase to M-Code capable receivers starting in FY17. The funds will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with the Next Generation Operational Control Segment (OCX), supports Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.\nImpacts of the M-Code deployment include:\n- Compliance with AFSPC\/CC mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for Early M-Code Operational Use and verification of Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR)effects.\n- Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.\n- Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and deployed properly.\n- Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE\/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding\n\nThe feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded by this budget item will determine whether or not an initiative to host Global Positioning System (GPS) M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial.  The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current US GPS satellite constellation."

                            "val": "The GPS III next generation space segment rapidly and affordably responds to warfighter capability requirements. The acquisition approach utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower risk incremental delivery of mature technologies. This approach focuses on mission success and on time delivery. The GPS III SVs will have GPS IIF capabilities plus up to a 3x-8x increase in anti-jam signal power, 3x improved accuracy, 3+ year increased design life, a new civil (L1C) signal compatible with the European Galileo system and a satellite bus capable of supporting future SV capability additions.\n\nOn 3 Jul 2015 USD(AT&L) approved the first phase of a two-phased GPS III SV acquisition strategy starting no earlier than SV11. The strategy utilizes FY2015-2017 RDTE funding for the Phase 1 effort to mature three contractors' GPS III production designs. The Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment is providing data and insight into contractors GPS III Production Design with emphasis on a mature navigation payload and production-ready designs. Phase 1 requires contractors to provide GPS III space vehicle and navigation payload production designs, manufacturing plans, and a navigation payload engineering brass board (hardware). The Air Force is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator which will provide signal flexibility (to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit). This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Lab\u2019s Science & Technology (S&T) funding and PE 1203265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payload awards.\n\nOn 19 Jul 2016 the PEO approved the Acquisition Strategy Document (ASD) for the COps effort. The strategy utilizes contingency constellation sustainment capability for GPS III Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). GPS III COps is needed because the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) will not deliver in time to support initial GPS III Space Vehicle operations. COps operates (post-launch and check-out) GPS III SVs at the capability level of GPS IIR-M or GPS IIF using the existing Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP) control segment.\n\nOn 21 Jan 2017, the PEO approved the ASD for the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program. The MCEU acquisition strategy, when executed, will enable the GPS Enterprise to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter prior to OCX delivery. MCEU will also support the scheduled operational testing of Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE). MCEU will update the GPS control segment software, AEP, to allow for command and control, processing, and integrity monitoring of the M-Code signal. MCEU will acquire this capability by using the existing GPS III prime contract vehicle to modify the operational AEP software.\n\nHQ USAF\/A5R approved reinstatement of a previously deferred KSA on 10 Feb 2016. The MSTIC receivers currently under development will get a software upgrade to process M-Code data. This $7.96M project to procure the M-MSTIC receivers is being funded through 3400 funds in FY16-FY18. Performance monitoring, integration and test will be conducted by M-Code Early Use program and sustained under the GPL Lockheed Martin Contract. Funding is sent through a Form-9 from DoD to Lockheed Martin."

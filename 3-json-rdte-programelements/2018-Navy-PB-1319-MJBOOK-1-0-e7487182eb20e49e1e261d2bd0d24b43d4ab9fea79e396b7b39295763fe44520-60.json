Naval Warfare Development Command (NWDC) also manages the Fleet Experimentation program (formerly Sea Trial).  In FY2018 the project will execute a number of new experimentations in the areas of Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW), Mine Warfare, Naval Integrated Fires, and Unmanned systems and conduct experiments (war simulations, Modeling & Simulation (M&S), at-sea events) to develop emerging Naval concepts.\n\nThe ACIID and SEW Engineering projects (0798 and 2144 respectively) are systems engineering non-acquisition programs to develop, test, implement Technical Authority (TA), and validate Naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System architectures to support naval, Joint and Coalition missions across normal, contested, and degraded operational environments.  The objectives of these projects are carried out by multiple tasks that ensure development and delivery of naval Information Warfare (IW) capabilities that are well-integrated, interoperable, secure, and resilient.  These projects also ensure: (1) the combined operational capabilities of SEW systems conform to applicable integrated architectures, and associated specifications and standards, intended to drive the interoperability and cybersecurity of capabilities for validated warfighting requirements; (2) Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (PEO C4I) Programs of Record (PoR) cybersecurity test requirements are evaluated by the cybersecurity vulnerability and functional test capability of the C4I components of the USS Secure laboratory. (3) development of technical guidance (architectures, specifications, and standards) to implement a single integrated Navy plan for cyber; (4) SEW systems and systems integration efforts involve innovative technology insertion methodologies to reduce timeline and costs for development and delivery of operational capability. \n\nThe ISR Architecture project (2147) is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE). As tasked by the Navy's ISR Council, this effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR POR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture."

The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACIID program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy (USN) expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Mission Partner Environment\/Future Mission Network (MPE\/FMN), the U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System - eXtended (BICES-X), and with the Joint Information Environment (JIE).  Currently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied\/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Denied, Degraded, Intermittent and Limited bandwidth (DDIL) operations, and to counter Anti-Access Area Denial (A2\/AD) threats. Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich IW data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA\/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, to include Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities as well as Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in secure data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements."

Major efforts include Joint Information Environment (JIE), the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) and the Risk Management Framework (RMF).  The Navy has made a number of modifications to account for emerging threats in cyber and address the need for greater interoperability to support key warfighting missions.\n\nAdditionally, the Navy has defined Information Warfare (IW) objectives for Assured Command and Control (C2), Battlespace Awareness, Integrated Fires (IF), and Cyber capabilities that require significant changes and improvements to the Navy's approach for managing its information infrastructure, content, and effects. Potential adversaries will exploit perceived United States (U.S.) space and cyberspace vulnerabilities, which could impact U.S. information-handling capabilities and wartime readiness.\n\nThe Navy has identified Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) as responsible for Information Technology (IT) Technical Authority (TA), Information Assurance (IA) TA and lead for  a cross-SYSCOM Technical Authority Board (TAB) to develop, monitor and approve architectures, technical standards, tools and processes that form the technical foundation of a single, integrated Navy plan for cybersecurity.  \n\nUSS Secure is a cyber assessment program within the Naval Research and Development Establishment (NR&DE). This cross-SYSCOM, cross-domain, System of Systems (SoS) (Afloat, Aloft, C4I & Shore) capability in a test laboratory environment provides a rapidly re-configurable capability that can integrate real maritime hardware systems into a virtual complete platform for platform level SoS cybersecurity research, development, test and evaluation, and training, not otherwise possible. This combination of SYSCOM laboratories, cyber ranges, and Red Teams more accurately simulating Navy platforms in operational maritime environments is critical for effectively evaluating cyber threats against specified mission threads.  \n\nThe cybersecurity vulnerability and functional test capability will support Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (PEO C4I) Programs of Record (PoR) cybersecurity test requirements and the C4I components of the USS Secure. This capability will provide a System of Systems (SoS) cyber test and assessment capability and facilitate the programs' compliance with both Department of Defense (DoD) (e.g. Risk Management Framework (RMF)) and Department of Navy (DoN) cybersecurity Test and Evaluation (T&E) policy, directives and requirements.  This effort includes establishing and designing the capability to test operationally representative C4I baselines, to include force level platforms, unit level platforms, and associated shore services and transport capabilities.  It will provide C4I enclave support to USS Secure enabling cyber assessments of systems and enclaves in an end-to-end environment. This program will include Red Team testing, Mission-thread Analysis, cyber risk assessments, and cyber base lining. Since no Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) of potential cyber threats on mission threads and C4I systems exists, this testing will prepare PoRs to meet and address acquisition milestones, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), and test objectives. \n\nThe engineering artifacts developed through the Technical Authority Board (TAB) provide Navy-specific guidance that facilitates common and consistent implementation of security controls across current and future Navy PoRs and eliminate redundancies and inefficiencies characteristic of previous stove-pipe development efforts in which each system addressed security individually.  These efforts enable a standardized and layered, Defense-in-Depth approach to improving the Navy's cybersecurity posture.  This enables some Navy programs to inherit required security controls from other systems, thereby reducing their cybersecurity requirements and associated integration costs.  The cybersecurity standards also support effective transition from Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) to RMF.\n\nTo realize the Information Warfare (IW) vision, the Navy will develop Information Technology (IT) and Information Assurance (IA) Technical Authority (TA) architectures, specifications, standards, and profiles to ensure Navy cyber capabilities can support critical warfighting functions in degraded or contested environments. \n\nTo support Navy objectives in advancing IW capabilities, the Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) provides four main functions:\n(1) Develop the architectures, specifications and standards to support a single integrated Navy plan for cybersecurity;\n(2) Provide the cybersecurity vulnerability and functional test capability which supports cybersecurity test requirements and the C4I components of the USS Secure. \n(3) Define an integrated Enterprise Architecture to support design, development and delivery of integrated Navy Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business IT, and Space System capabilities; and\n(4) Drive rigorous Systems Engineering discipline to support rapid development and delivery of secure and interoperable C4ISR, Business IT, and Space Systems capabilities that meet Fleet requirements.\n\nProducts provided:\n1) Integrated architectures, specifications and standards to reflect current (as-is) and future (target) end states to support technical analyses, program planning, and enterprise-level investment decisions across current and future C4ISR, Business IT, and Space System capabilities.  \n- Defense-in-Depth cybersecurity architectures and standards derived from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requirements and tailored for Navy-specific implementation in combat\/weapon system, Naval control system, Business IT, and C4I programs across all of the Navy Systems Commands.\n- Fit for Purpose \/ Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) compliant architecture views to support PoR Engineering\/Acquisition documentation requirements and ensure alignment with applicable Joint Information Environment (JIE), Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE), Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) Enterprise Architecture, and other higher-level architectures.\n2) Engineering tools and processes that support and drive consistent application of technical rigor across all design, development, validation and certification activities for C4ISR, Business IT, and Space IW systems. \n- Single, authoritative repository to maintain validated engineering artifacts with associated technical performance attributes to support advanced model-based engineering analyses and studies. \n- Development and refinement of model-based systems engineering tools to support mission thread driven analysis enabling the identification of capability gaps and overlaps, interoperability issues, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities between Navy System of Systems (SoS) capabilities.\n- Initial planning and procurement to establish cybersecurity test capabilities and the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) components of the USS Secure, a cross-Systems Command (SYSCOM) distributed Cyber test capability in support of cybersecurity testing. \n- Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) to provide independent, objective assessments of the technical maturity and compliance with applicable architectures, specifications and standards for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space Systems.\n- End-to-End Systems Engineering and Integrated Design - Operational feasibility studies, technical feasibility studies, technical roadmap engineering validations, architectures, and assessment traceability matrices.\n- Engineering Evaluations to ensure delivered C4ISR, Business IT, and Space Systems are validated as meeting operational needs and interoperability requirements.\n- Technical analysis and engineering artifacts to ensure integration and interoperability across Assured Command and Control (C2), Battlespace Awareness, and Integrated Fires (IF) to deliver integrated Information Warfare (IW) capabilities to Navy warfighters."

They also serve as a means to influence and drive Programs of Record (PoR) toward a common, more efficient state that promotes interoperability and security.\n\nThe Naval Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Reference Architecture project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE) and Space & Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR)-wide Enterprise Architecture policies.  As tasked by the Navy's ISR Council, this effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR PoR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture.  These efforts will help reduce Information Technology (IT)\/ISR infrastructure complexity and variance, making it easier to manage, operate and defend our ISR capabilities, and help inform investment decisions across the Navy's ISR enterprise to support the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) objectives for Assured Command and Control (C2), Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires (IF).\n\nThis effort will encompass the documentation and analysis of current ISR enterprise architectures to inform and guide requirements for target architecture development and performance requirements to support full use and incorporation of ISR capabilities to advance Navy operations afloat.  The associated studies will produce both technical and non-technical implementation guidance across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) spectrum."

The priorities for the CG\/CD program are to develop concept\/concept of operations and explore near\/far-term technological and non-technological solutions to war fighting gaps across all naval warfare areas. The associated experimentation efforts include planning, systems engineering and integration, modeling and simulation support, event execution, data collection, analysis, and assessment for a wide-range of experimentation efforts including the examination of prototypes, tactical development and evaluation, support for S&T innovation, and program of record system development; venues such as workshops, seminars, war games, limited objective experiments, limited technical experiments, and live at-sea events are used to execute these experimentation efforts.\n(2) Provides naval warfare subject matter expertise, experiment planning expertise, and analysis expertise to NWDC who plans, executes, and assesses fleet experimentation for the fleets and warfighting development centers (WDC) at the operational and tactical levels. This experimentation includes a focus on NWDC's WDC integration role, maritime command and control (C2), advanced cross-domain warfighting, and maritime operations centers (MOCS)\/operational level of war (OLW) lines of operations. Fleet experimentation seeks to solve fleet-identified warfighting gaps (referenced within the Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL), Urgent Operational Needs Statements (UONS), CUSFF\/CPF Commander's Guidance, etc.). The experimentation and prototyping efforts of the NWDC team support the \"last tactical mile\" of many Navy Science and Technology (S&T) programs by supporting those programs where the technology is mature enough, but requires evaluation on or by a \"fleet asset\" - ships, airplanes, submarines, and sailors.\n(3) Provides modeling and simulation (M&S) support to Fleet and NWDC experimentation efforts. M&S is used to stimulate decision making during seminar-style and system war gaming experiments and provides the simulated operational environment and capabilities with high-fidelity models such as the Joint Semi-Automated Force (JSAF) program. Additionally, where applicable, the Navy Simulation System (NSS) \"Monte Carlo\" model is also used to give high confidence solutions and outcomes to complex warfighting problems.\n(4) Provides for focused, solution-driven tactics development and evaluation through experimentation. This effort is focused on developing near-term doctrine solutions to address specific fleet-identified tactical issues.\n\nTypical Maritime Concept Generation and Concept Development products include:\n- Enabling concepts\n- Concepts of operations (CONOPS)\n- Final experiment reports (including findings, insights, and recommendations and DOTMLPF change recommendations and plans for action)\n- Experiment Analysis Summary Reference Documents\n- New\/revised doctrinal and Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures publications\n- White papers (think pieces) intended to generate further discussion within Navy leadership\nSpecific products are listed in the Accomplishments\/Plans section of this exhibit."

FY 18 experiments (both at-sea and via war games) will strive to achieve the objectives as laid out in the accompanying action\/implementation plan.\nEMW Experiment Campaign \/ Naval Integrated Fires Campaign\n* NWDC will conduct multiple events designed to synchronize and align experiment initiatives with EMW tasks to provide solutions to EMW capability gaps and to ensure development of doctrine and TTP is synchronized with the introduction of new technology and provides the Fleet and Fleet trainers with required doctrine tools at the tactical and operational levels. Specific events currently planned for FY18 include:\n* Fleet Battle Experiment EMW (FBX 18). FBX 18 will consist of a large, free play-based event focused on an assessment across the EMW objective areas. The primary focus of this effort will be to revise and validate the contents of existing and newly developed EMW-related doctrine, TTP, and CONOPS.\n* EMW Technical War Game (Spectral Tsunami 18-1). Spectral Tsunami 18-1 is the last in a series of war games planned to evaluate the individual and cumulative effects of emerging capabilities in vignette-based scenarios and to enable operators to work side-by-side with technology developers to identify ways to close capability gaps in an effort to reach the articulated EMW 2020 endstate.\nUnmanned Systems Experimentation\n* This effort will be conducted to examine (via both at-sea events and war game \/ workshop venues) not only the warfighting utility and multiple employment options offered by various types of unmanned systems in support of naval warfare missions but also the key enablers required to maintain and control these evolving systems for enduring missions. \n* Additionally, both at-sea and war game \/ workshop venues will be used to refine our abilities to counter UxS as it applies across the breadth of naval missions.\n* Emerging Concepts Wargame(s) - This effort will employ multiple seminar wargames to examine emerging concepts such as Distributed Maritime Operations, Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment or Operational Logistics.\n* Trident Warrior 2018 At-Sea Experiment. The TRIDENT WARRIOR 2018 (TW18) experiment will execute in partnership with a numbered fleet commander. The effort will evaluate technology and\/or TTP-related initiatives to close warfighting gaps identified across multiple Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCLs).

In addition, FLEX addresses innovative concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Fleet Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) that collectively mitigate Fleet-identified warfighting capability gaps as defined by Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces' (CUSFF)\/Commander, Pacific Fleet's (CPF) annual FLEX guidance. Through experimentation activities such as workshops, system or seminar war games, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel tangible solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products to the fleet. While Navy-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&T), academia, and industry partners.\n\nExperimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities. As such, the FLEX program directly supports four of the five elements outlined in the Secretary of the Navy's Innovation Vision: Build the Naval Innovation Network, Improve the Use of DON Information, Accelerate Emerging Operational Capabilities to the Fleet, and Develop Game-Changing Warfighting Concepts. In accordance with the joint CUSFF and CPF FLEX instruction, the FLEX program is the conduit to conduct experimentation using operational fleet assets. As such, the FLEX program, and associated efforts of the FLEX team, provides critical support to achieve the \"last tactical mile\" of Navy and S&T programs. This \"last tactical mile\" support is delivered through \"at sea\" or \"salt-water\" testing and experimentation at the point when the technology is sufficiently mature and requires evaluation using a fleet asset - ships, airplanes, submarines, networks, and\/or sailors."

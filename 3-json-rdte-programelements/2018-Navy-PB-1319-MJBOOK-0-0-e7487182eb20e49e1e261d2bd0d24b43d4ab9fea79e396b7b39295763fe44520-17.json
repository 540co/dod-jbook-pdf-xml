This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nThe programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The EMRG capability will support Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Fast Attack Craft and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC\/FIAC) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions.  Design, fabricate and integrate Electro Magnetic (EM) railgun subsystems and components into a system prototype capable of rep-rate operations.  Assess the manufacturability of major components such as the railgun launcher and pulsed power modules, which are key to the technology capability. Conduct preliminary prototype system tests and demonstrations to prove the technological feasibility of the EMRG capability and assess sub-system and component operability under stressing rep-rate conditions.  Continue developing and testing a prototype rep-rate railgun launcher that is suitable for installation in a prototype railgun gun mount, where the design of the power and energy architecture necessary to support the prototype EMRG system can be assessed.  Continue to test and build full-scale electro-magnetic railgun system prototypes that include the battery charging system, the pulsed power subsystem, and the electromagnetic launcher.  Perform full-scale testing of long-life railgun launcher material solutions inserted in laboratory launchers.  Design, build, test, and evaluate iterative electromagnetic railgun composite launcher prototypes to demonstrate the technological feasibility, performance, multi-shot life, and suitable firing rate of the system.  Continue activities to integrate and test a Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP) for use with the EMRG.\n\nContinue SSL TM.  Continue development of a maritime laser weapons system prototype and test it on a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant. Conduct the required laser weapon system engineering, design, integration and testing necessary to have a testable, experimental prototype. This system will be capable of supporting missions such as defense against small boat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) disruption and defeat.  The results of scientific and engineering trade studies, including those that measure atmospheric absorption and turbulence, will be used to support the integration and testing of a maritime beam director and a high power, Solid State Laser (SSL) capable of tracking and engaging surface and airborne targets at a relevant stand-off distance in the maritime environment.  A Hybrid Predictive Avoidance Safety System (HPASS) will be integrated with a solid state laser weapon system demonstrator to de-conflict laser operations with friendly sensors and platforms. At-sea testing will be conducted on the full laser weapon system demonstrator (i.e., prototype) from a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant."

BEC Increment 0 is a Program of Record and DoD's only authoritative biometric repository, providing 24\/7 operational support for the Warfighter and interagency partners to decide and act in near-real time with timely identification and identity verification of known or suspected terrorists across the full range of military operations and preventing terrorist operations. DoD ABIS enables DOD, Interagency and International Partners to effectively impede adversary's ability to conceal their identity and intentions. DoD ABIS supports all three objectives of the National Defense Strategy to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation and improve business practices\n\nThe Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) under the Provost Marshal General, fulfills the Secretary of the Army's Executive Agent (EA) responsibilities for\nall DoD forensics and biometrics activities. In addition, DFBA is the proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) and\ninformation management support throughout the Armed Services and DoD. DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvements, and implementation of\nefficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities\nthat contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational\neffectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific\nrequirements identified by combat developers.\n\nJustification:\n\nFY 2020 RDT&E funding in the amount of $0.281 million (DT2: Non-MIP Biometrics) supports cyber security testing and preparation for DoD ABIS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) operational testing.\n \nFY 2020 funding in the amount of $1.421 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility,\nand DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA supports the conduct of biometrics and forensics activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability\nassessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders."

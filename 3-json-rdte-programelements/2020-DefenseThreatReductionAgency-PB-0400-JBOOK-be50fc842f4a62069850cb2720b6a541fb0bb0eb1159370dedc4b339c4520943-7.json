This system delivers data continuously to the U.S. monitoring and verification community supports warfighter and interagency nuclear-event response in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) objectives and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n\nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment. This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to countering WMD. Technical assessments are made against nuclear treaty implementation and nuclear event response requirements to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide U.S. International Monitoring System (IMS) data, and to access international IMS data required to support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.\n\nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is to improve the efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of U.S. IMS stations; optimize IMS capabilities to support both nuclear treaty monitoring and nuclear-event response; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of nuclear events. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies."

The IMS data availability\/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems. The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event. RDT&E is conducted in support of the NACT\u2019s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT IMS monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratory in accordance with CTBT requirements at the lowest cost.  Data quality metrics continue to evolve as the entire CTBT IMS capability is exercised and tested."

This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.\n  \nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.\n \nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies."

The IMS data availability\/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event.  RDT&E is conducted in support of the NACT\u2019s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT IMS monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratory in accordance with CTBT requirements at the lowest cost.  CTBT IMS data availability\/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  Data quality metrics continue to evolve as the entire CTBT IMS capability is exercised and tested."

Joint Cyber C2 establishes congressionally directed focal point to provide integrated Joint Cyber C2 solutions to all echelons for execution of cyberspace operations to enable and accelerate planning\/collaboration between Cyber Mission Forces and Combatant Commands.\n\nIt will integrate Cyber C2 with Joint, Coalition and inter-agency C2 to enhance multi-domain operations and reduce planning time, improve decision quality and speed resulting in a shorter kill chain. Activities include, but are not limited to: Rapid prototyping, development of software\/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction for emerging technologies.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JCC2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Joint Cyber C2 establishes congressionally directed focal point to provide integrated Joint Cyber C2 solutions to all echelons for execution of cyberspace operations to enable and accelerate planning\/collaboration between Cyber Mission Forces and Combatant Commands.\n\nIt will integrate Cyber C2 with Joint, Coalition and inter-agency C2 to enhance multi-domain operations and reduce planning time, improve decision quality and speed resulting in a shorter kill chain. Activities include, but are not limited to: Rapid prototyping, development of software\/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction for emerging technologies.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JCC2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

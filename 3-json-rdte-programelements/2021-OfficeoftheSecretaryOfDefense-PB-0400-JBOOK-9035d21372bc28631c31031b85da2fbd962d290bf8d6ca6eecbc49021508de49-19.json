This funding will be used to mature and demonstrate emerging technologies, such as the Department\u2019s Modernization Technology Areas, that contribute to the broader joint mission needs."

Enabling the warfighter to execute short duration pilots with these emerging technologies provides a cost effective way to leverage commercial investment for DoD purposes, sharing costs with OGA partners, informing warfighter requirements for follow-on acquisition through traditional DoD channels, and allowing other DoD R&D organizations to focus their resources on both the integration of commercial technologies showing promise in these warfighter pilots as well as on traditional R&D in technologies not well served by commercial start-up companies."

To be selected, a proposed project must have a validated requirement, an engaged requirement champion, a viable acquisition strategy, and a qualified program management office. A technology project must identify its starting and desired end-state Technology Readiness Level. Likewise, the end-user for any proposed project must demonstrate a long-term plan for acceptance and sustainment of a fieldable capability. Project period of performance is typically 12-18 months."

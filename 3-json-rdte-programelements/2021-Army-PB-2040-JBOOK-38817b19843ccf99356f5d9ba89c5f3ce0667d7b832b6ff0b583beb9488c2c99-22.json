            "val": "The Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS) is a critical system in the Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) concept that will employ MDO capabilities at all echelons and allow ground based forces to project power from land into other domains to defeat highly capable enemies, secure terrain, and consolidate gains. FUAS encompasses an array of capabilities from platoon soldiers to Division Commanders. The Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved the FUAS Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) on 6 Mar 2019. The FUAS ICD includes requirements for Future Tactical UAS (FTUAS), Air Launched Effects (ALE), and Scalable Control Interface (SCI). Manned, optionally-manned, and unmanned systems will penetrate defense-in-depth environments by employing ALE with teaming and swarming effects to detect, decoy, jam radar and communications, conduct cyber-attack, spoof and jam Global Positioning System (GPS), and kinetic engagement.\n\nThe Future Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team (FVL CFT) FUAS line of effort is comprised of multiple components including the FTUAS for the Brigade Combat Team (BCT), and ALE. The FTUAS seeks to replace the RQ-7Bv2 Shadow assets within the BCTs. Key attributes of the FTUAS BCT focus on Rapid Deployability, Expeditionary Maneuver, and Mobility for adaptive and agile operations. FTUAS will consist of an aircraft subsystem that will include the airframe, propulsion, avionics, communications, navigation, and software systems; aircraft-specific ground support equipment including power generation, transportation, or command and control equipment; aircraft software; and required engineering, logistics, programmatic support.  ALE extends tactical and operational reach, lethality, and protection to the advanced team as an attritable or optionally recoverable aerial capability that detects, identifies, locates, and reports threats; represents a credible decoy; disrupts threat communication, targeting and acquisition systems; and delivers lethal and non-lethal effects against those threats across Multi-Domain Operations.  \n\nJustification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 FTUAS Research Development Technology & Evaluation (RDT&E) Base funding of $40.122 million will be utilized for the following: 1) $16.797 million to support the FTUAS early development, 2) $20.000 million to support ALE Systems Analysis, 3) $3.325 million provides Systems Engineering and Program Management (SEPM) to support FTUAS."

The Demonstration effort will focus on conducting analysis and obtaining field data that will inform the FTUAS Capability Development Document (CDD). A MDD review will be held in FY 2021.\n\nAP-RDD - Prepared ALE Initial Capability Refinement Document (ICRD) that was approved by GEN John M. Murray, CG, AFC on 21 Oct 2019.\n\nThe plan to acquire ALE is through an incremental approach that allows rapid prototyping and fielding of technology to field available capabilities while continuing S&T efforts to mature and transition emerging technologies to fully realize required capabilities. This is accomplished through multiple prototype development activities for the air vehicle, payloads, and mission system architecture through, experiments, simulations, and demonstrations conducted in parallel and\/or sequential timelines. The objective of this incremental effort is to develop and exhibit multiple ALE prototypes to enable a rapid transition from prototype to operational implementation in the force. Increment 1A will be a COTS\/GOTS system to enable technology maturation, systems integration, and potential initial capabilities. ALE program of record will be purpose built utilizing parallel efforts informed by S&T investments and information learned from the demonstration and testing of Increment 1A. Additional increments will leverage the mission system architecture, payload technologies and interfaces from the initial increment and seek to extend the range of ALE for missions in support of LRPF."

This PE also funds collaborative applied research and integration of government, academic, and industry scientific research to advance innovative capabilities.\n\nThis PE sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this PE builds on the materials research transitioned from PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences) and 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers). This work complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nThis work is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

Research conducted enables new manufacturing capabilities through the development of high performance feedstock materials (polymers, metals, and ceramics), physics-based process models, and in situ process monitoring that can be integrated with process models to enable real-time control and manipulation of materials structure and properties. The goal of this work is to develop robust predictive model and simulation tools linking manufacturing processes with materials structure, properties, and performance to accelerate the rate of innovative material adaptations (protection, power, sensing, and signature management) necessary to rapidly respond to emerging and unknown threats in a battlefield environment.\n\nThis Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, and Soldier portfolios.\n\nWork in this Project makes extensive use of high performance computing and experimental validation and builds on research transitioned from PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences) \/ Project H42 (Materials and Mechanics), and Project H43 (Research In Ballistics). The work complements and is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Survivability and Lethality Technologies), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology), and PE 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

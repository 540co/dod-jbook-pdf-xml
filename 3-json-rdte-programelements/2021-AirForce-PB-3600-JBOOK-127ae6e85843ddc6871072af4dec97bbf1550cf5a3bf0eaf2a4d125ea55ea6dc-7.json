Adaptive engine technology enables next generation combat aircraft capabilities by combining the efficiency of high bypass turbofans used by commercial airlines with the performance demanded of military fighter engines. This technology has undergone initial development under the auspices of the Air Force Research Laboratory through the Adaptive Engine Technology and Adaptive Engine Technology Demonstrator programs.\n\nIn addition, this program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver advanced engine capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The prototype engines will demonstrate fuel efficiency increases, thrust increases, and new component technologies by performing sea-level, altitude, and durability assessments across multiple power settings. These assessments will provide data to quantify the capability and reduce risk in areas such as thermal capacity, reliability, and supportability, among others.\n\nThe FY 2021 Budget Justification Exhibit has been updated to reflect the breakout of the FY2019 through FY 2021 Next Generation Adaptive Engine (NGAP) funds from the AETP effort to increase transparency to Congress.

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) funds analytical products necessary for the inherently-governmental Army Test & Evaluation Command\/Army Evaluation Center (ATEC\/AEC) mission. Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest-priority Army systems, whether those systems are employed during stability, support, defensive, or offensive missions. While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this PE are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.\n\nDeveloped through measurement, experiment, test support, and modeling and simulation (M&S), ATEC uses the products funded by this PE in many ways to make the Army force more survivable. This PE provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization. Products concern: Army fire support systems, direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command and communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role. Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items, including protective equipment such as helmets and vests. These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight. Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally-needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.\n\nSurvivability analyses funded by this PE are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include: guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; Cybersecurity and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons. This survivability information enables developers, users, and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel. These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces. Survivability data and analysis results funded by this PE are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers. Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's Army Regulation (AR) 5-5 studies process.

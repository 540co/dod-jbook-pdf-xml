USD(A&S) is responsible for compliance with the FY2011 NDAA and Chairs the CIMB. Funds provide technical, systems engineering, trend analysis, and portfolio management of programs, projects and activities developing cyber capabilities to maximize the Department's return on investment of cyberspace resources and effect a comprehensive approach for assessing, procuring, and sustaining critical cyber capabilities and cyber resilient systems and platforms from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of weapons systems performance and military operations. Additionally, these funds will provide systems analyses, portfolio management, executive support of CIMB, enterprise wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to Cyber capabilities and ensuring cyber resilience within systems and platforms. Resources will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance, cost parameters, determining and mitigating cyber risks of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to assure capability advantage, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts, minimize cyber related performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex systems, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address cyber security requirements, gaps and required technical solutions."

Since that time, OSD has presented over 100 potential projects to DDS, some of which would benefit significantly from the enhanced prototyping capabilities of DDS. With appropriate funding, DDS leverage, its private sector expertise to fully support the build of a system prototype \/ proof-of-concept. RDT&E funding is required to support the DDS mission, which includes the ability to build software prototypes to prove out concepts for mission critical projects identified by the Department.\n\nEnsuring that DDS has RDT&E capabilities will increase DoD\u2019s ability to leverage DDS\u2019s unique technical expertise to determine which private sector software development best practices and\/or technology work best for the Department. Furthermore, the development and testing of DDS prototypes, and the insight gained, would significantly lower development costs and delivery times through traditional DoD methods."

Since its launch in November 2015, DDS has project demands from OSD that have increased exponentially; some of those requests would benefit from robust prototyping \/ proof-of-concept capabilities by DDS teams. The former is dependent on RDT&E funding that supports the ability to acquire the most current technological solution and\/or support from vendors well versed in the most advanced technological solutions.  \n\nThe requested RDT&E funds will enable DDS to build prototypes and implement proof-of-concept tests for some key OSD projects. These projects will support missions in and out of theater, as well as long term goals of the department to modernize its offensive and defensive technological capabilities.  DoD interest in leveraging DDS to operate in this area to solve hard and impossible problems is persistent.  With appropriate funding, DDS can use the superior technical expertise of its staff, as well as ability to quickly deliver usable products to meet demand."

These problems span across classified and unclassified problem spaces, and range from software development, piloting the use of commercial software as a replacement for antiquated government systems, and modernizing and refactoring broken systems.  Some examples of current projects include: replacing the MEPCOM Integrated Resources System, reimagining the user interface and associated databases for the Defense Property System, devising a hard and software solution to counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems that attack warfighters in theater, and developing a novel and modern approach to network defense.

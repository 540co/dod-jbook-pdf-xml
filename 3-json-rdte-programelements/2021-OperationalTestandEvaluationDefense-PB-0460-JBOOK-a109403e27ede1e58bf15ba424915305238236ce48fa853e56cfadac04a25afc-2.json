            "val": "The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).\n\nJoint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  New projects are also encouraged to align their efforts to supporting the 2018 National Defense Strategy.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.\n\nThreat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  As DOT&E\u2019s agent, Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates, and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD (A&S)).  Threat Systems provides DOT&E action officers and other DOT&E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and the actual development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.\n\nThe Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) Test & Evaluation (T&E) Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure\/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), weapon system developers, and the Services. The Center\u2019s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM\/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft. The Center develops unique CM\/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines the effectiveness of precision-guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs. Analysis and recommendations on CM\/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&E, DASD (DT&E), and the Services. The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM\/CCM technology and capabilities.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds."

These activities help DOT&E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.\n\nThe Center\nThe Center\u2019s core mission to support T&E of aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) directly leads to a \u2018more lethal force\u2019 by enabling the survivability of aircraft in a threat environment. Survivability enables mission success. The Center expects to conduct, analyze, and report on more than 40 tests, with 31 requests for test support already under consideration or planned. Most testing will focus on aircraft survivability, with a focus on Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) and Urgent Universal Needs Statement (UUNS), warning and targeting systems, warfighter training events, and precision guided weapons. The Center will provide the programs with an independent assessment of our data\/findings for CM\/CCM evaluations. The Center will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&E enterprise, with a clear focus on Title 10 oversight, aircraft survivability, and warfighter training events. Furthermore, the Center will continue to provide CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM\/CCM-focused training, tactics and procedures (TTP) development. Our support will be distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities. These activities will help to enhance and support the survivability of equipment, aircraft and personnel.  \n\nThe Center will continue to build upon Improvement and Modernization (I&M) efforts from FY 2018 to improve T&E capabilities. Specifically the emitters for the missile plume simulators will be upgraded to increase threat fidelity. The Center is undertaking the Joint Standard Instrumentation Suite (JSIS) project to collect threat signature and fly out data to improve infrared-guided threat models.  These models form the basis for a significant portion of ASE T&E.  JSIS reached initial operational capability this year to start initial data collection at threat live fire events. The JSIS full operational capability development will begin this fiscal year.\n\nIn addition, the Center supports each Service\u2019s ASE programs with its unique test equipment, which reduces duplicate T&E capabilities.  This benefit, along with the transportability of the Center\u2019s unique test equipment, provides DoD a cost savings that results in \u2018greater performance and affordability\u2019. The Center will provide expertise to many organizations, including program offices and other T&E agencies. \n\nInternationally, the Center will continue to \"Strengthen Alliances and attract new partners\" through collaborative international T&E efforts. The Center serves as the Steering Committee chair and actively participates in the Air Electronic Warfare Cooperative Test and Evaluation Project Arrangement with Australia, Canada, Great Britain and the U.S. Also, the Center supports international cooperative efforts through direct country-to-country T&E activities and continued involvement in the following groups:  NATO SUB-GROUP\/2 and NATO\u2019s Aerospace Capabilities Group 3 (Air Survivability)\/Subgroup 2 (EW Self-Protection Measures for Joint Services Airborne Assets). \n\nDomestically, the Center will continue our involvement in the following panels, committees and working groups:  Joint Expendable Countermeasure (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Multi Sensing Symposia (MSS) Joint Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) Working Group, JASP, Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&E Subcommittee, and Joint Countermeasures T&E Working Group (JCMT&E WG)."

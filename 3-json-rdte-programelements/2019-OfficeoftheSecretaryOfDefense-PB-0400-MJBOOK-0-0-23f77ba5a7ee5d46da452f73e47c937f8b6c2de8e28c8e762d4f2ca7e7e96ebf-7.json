However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cybersecurity of all Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure the Department's missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cybersecurity and computer network operations to:  develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new and resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military\u2019s ability to disrupt, fight and survive nation-state actors\u2019 cyber-attacks, measure the state of health in cybersecurity, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, along with the ability to protect tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.\n\nThis program is unique in that it integrates both the defensive and offensive cyber research from each of the Services to develop interoperable, defense-wide technology options targeted to meet Combatant Command needs and requirements.  More specifically, by increasing cross-laboratory collaboration, this program is able to take Service-specific technologies and expand their applications to the Joint Force."

                            "val": "The Cyber Applied Research program was initiated in FY 2011 to address specific technical problems that were not being fully addressed by the Services\u2019 and the National Security Agency's existing Cyber science and technology (S&T) investments.  Recently, S&T gaps were enumerated and described in several studies, including the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2016 Commission Enhancing National Cybersecurity, and the 2017 Defense Science Board Research Enterprise Assessment.  The Cyber Applied Research program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  Over the past several years, the program expanded research in cyber capabilities to provide Warfighters and commanders with tools and technologies to enable cyber situational awareness, cyber command-and-control, cyber operations, and protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  From FY 2011 to FY 2017, the program explored a number of technical thrusts that included:\n\n\u2022 Foundations of Trust:  Developing known degrees of assurance that devices, networks, and cyber-dependent functions perform as expected, despite attack or error.  \n\n\u2022 Resilient Infrastructure:  Exploring technologies that not only withstand, but react to cyber attacks, and sustain or recover critical functions. \n\n\u2022 Assuring Effective Missions:  Developing technologies that assess and control the cyber situation in mission context while staging, conducting, and monitoring cyber responses.\n\n\u2022 Cyber Modeling, Simulation & Experimentation:  Simulating environments in which the Department operates and enables a more robust assessment and validation of the cyber technology development. \n\n\u2022 Embedded, Mobile & Tactical Environments:  Exploring cyber systems that rely on technologies beyond wired networking and standard computing platforms.\n\nAs adversaries develop more sophisticated technology tactics and become more skilled and better funded, the Cyber S&T Community must remain agile, vigilant, and evermore creative in response.  Starting in late FY 2016, the Department reviewed the emerging needs of the joint operational community, new cyber threats, and the evolution DoD technology needs to focus the program on the changing cyber environment and missions.  To bolster this program and address future threats, a new strategic vision was developed to enhance the DoD\u2019s tactical edge in the rapidly evolving cyber domain where many aspects still remain unexplored.  Seedling projects under the new research areas were initiated in late FY 2017.  Judiciously investigating aspects of this research in thrusts areas identified below will provide a distinct advantage in future cyber conflicts: \n\n\u2022 Behavioral Cyber Sciences:  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior by moving beyond signals (ones and zeroes) towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral sciences will increase the effectiveness of tools, the cyber workforce, and improve the utility of cyber solutions.  Behavioral cyber sciences seeks to uncover details about how humans (to include operators, users, adversaries, and\/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood from a behavioral science standpoint and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcome.  \n\n\u2022 Self-securing weapons, systems, and networks:  Prevailing in a contested cyber environment will require new sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity to keep pace with the growing complexity of weapon systems and help the DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Autonomous cyber defenses will need to apply the recent advances in artificial intelligence research. \n\n\u2022 Foundations of precision cyber operations:  Precision bombing campaigns for the cyber domain require accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects to enable DoD leadership to achieve the desired effects of cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.\n\n\u2022 Mathematical Foundations of Cyber Security:  Advancing mathematical foundations of cyber S&T will cut across focus areas and produce new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.\n\nAdvances in these new cyber S&T focus thrust areas will help to promote strong foundations and disruptive innovations that will create surprises, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas will be critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cyber security beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense."

This effort built upon long term foundational basic research in algorithms, models, probability theory, reliability, statistical theory and analysis, system structures, and secure computing, developing and enabling trustworthy cyber systems.\n\nResearch in algorithms helped develop methods to manipulate automated image processing computation using Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs), accelerating graphics processing unit (GPU) analysis.

This provided the ability to continue to perform functions and provided services at required levels during an attack.  The objective in this area was to develop integrated architectures that were optimized for their ability to absorb cyber shock and recover in a timely fashion to a known secure state with well-defined performance characteristics.  Resilient algorithms and protocols increased the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research was needed to develop resiliency at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resilient architectures.\n\nFunded research under the Tactical Platform Cyber Resiliency project, developed techniques for furnishing resiliency on critical real-time control systems against cyber-attacks.  Through the enhancement of existing fault tolerance on physical systems, known as Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), combinations of artificial, manipulated crashes, and delayed input evolved a level of tolerance to enforce resilience.  The successful collaboration with Siemens transitioned the technology to the Naval Capability Program, Resilient Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical Security (RHIMES), which is now supports the NATO Sea Sparrow program.\n\nUnder the Network PUMP-II project, research explored the challenges of optimizing enterprise based data sharing requirements for the tactical war-fighter and intelligence missions.  The project developed a cost effective, high throughput government-off-the-shelf cross domain solutions that provided the war-fighter with improved sensitive data correlation and intelligent data decision capabilities.  The technology is transitioning to the Naval Air Systems Command, Triton Unmanned Aircraft System Program Office."

The vast majority of DoD weapons systems, platforms, and networks rely on software to operate.  Software can often be disrupted remotely, which necessitates a new kind of security to protect against cyber-attacks.  Defending the software- and network-based aspects of critical weapon systems is challenging for a number of reasons, chief among which is the advanced nature of the adversary in the cyber realm.  The Department can expect future cyber adversaries to be well-funded, well-informed, and agile.  Building weapon systems, platforms, and networks that can defend themselves in real time will be vital in protecting ourselves against the adversary.  The DoD needs systems that will autonomously monitor and manage their own health and security posture through advanced sensing and perception, reasoning, and planning.  Such systems could identify and classify threats much more quickly than a human operator, and therefore, be able to neutralize the threat more quickly and effectively.  However, researchers must be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of turning security over to autonomous systems.  Verification techniques must be developed to ensure that autonomous and dynamic system changes maintain correct mission-focused capabilities without introducing unintended vulnerabilities.  Conversely, developing techniques to track and audit actions taken by autonomous systems is crucial to ensure that direct control can be reasserted, potentially reversing actions, if necessary."

Cyber operators often have incomplete information about their target prior to completing an action.  The lack of a complete picture makes it difficult to predict the precise outcomes or collateral damage caused by a cyber operation. In this type of uncertain environment, military leaders may be acting with an undue sense of caution in using cyber capabilities.  Improved technology and techniques for quantifying cyber effects, estimating their cost and effectiveness, predicting consequences, and ensuring precise effects will help both to limit collateral damage and to ensure that a chosen action has the intended effect upon the adversary.  Highly precise and predictable cyber effects can also achieve mission goals despite the presence of both incomplete and maliciously-created false information."

            "val": "The Advanced Concepts & Performance Assessments PE delivers an integrated government concept definition, simulation, and analysis capability. It also centralizes assessment of advanced ballistic missile defense technology.  Delivering insight into the performance of proposed concepts extends MDA's ability to address evolving threats for the warfighter.\n\nSubject matter experts provide independent assessments of government, university, and industry technology concepts, used in concert with systems engineering requirements, to support acquisition strategy decisions and define technology focus areas.  The innovative structured concept definition and assessment methodology enables the MDA to quickly validate focus areas, verify contractor technology solutions, and evaluate promising concepts in future Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) architectures.   This methodology significantly enhances MDA's ability to assess technology concepts while decreasing the cost of development through:\n- Independent model-based simulations of industry technology concepts to inform the systems engineering process\n- Digital simulation and hardware-in-the-loop performance assessments of algorithms and hardware concepts prior to expensive live fire test events\n- End-to-end testing of technology concepts integrated with weapon systems and Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications \n\nPerformance assessment of advanced concepts incorporates Better Buying Power philosophy in the earliest stages of technology development to maximize the efficiency of technology investments. Performance assessment supports evaluation and analysis of capabilities across right and left of launch."

Integrating models of promising technical solutions into BMDS system-level simulations enables leadership to make data driven acquisition and technology investment decisions.  This funding capitalizes on the innovation of small business, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and University Affiliated Research Centers to pursue a broad range of hardware, software, models, algorithms, trade studies and analysis.  These innovations bring together government developed models representing existing and future ballistic missile defense architectures, technology concepts, and advanced algorithms to provide detailed assessments of concept performance and inform investment decisions. These innovations, combined with a robust high performance computing infrastructure, provide a unique in-house government capability to demonstrate and assess technology concepts."

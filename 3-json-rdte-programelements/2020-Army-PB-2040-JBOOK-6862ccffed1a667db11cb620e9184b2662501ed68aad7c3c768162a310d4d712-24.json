The required tools provide Army and DoD leadership, commanders, and warfighters the intelligence necessary for making advantageous operational planning, policies, and timely decisions. Modernization of these systems is a core component of ensuring overmatch on current and future battlefields. Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, funding for these efforts was transferred to PE 0606003 \/ Project FI9 (Counter Intel and Human Intel Modernization) from PE 0303028A (INTEL SPT TO FORCE XXI) \/ Project FG2 (Counterintelligence & Human Intel Modernization).\n\nLines of effort include the following:\n\nThe Joint Service Counter C4ISR Initiative conducts technical analyses and research focused on centers of gravity within the C4ISR architecture of adversary weapon systems that enable successful kinetic and non-kinetic engagements. The Army will use the intelligence provided from this effort to inform the development of offensive cyber and advanced electronic warfare capabilities against adversaries as well as countermeasure development against key adversary weapon systems. \n\nArmy HUMINT collection conducted through all phases of the operational spectrum in order to provide DoD Commanders, Planners, and Decision Makers valuable insight of the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign operations, foreign persons, and international terrorism organizations.  Also provides advance HUMINT training using Nationally validated courses, standardized practices, and proven Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures.\n\nThe Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems (BICES) Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Web Presence will resource contractor development to deliver software to provide data interoperability between U.S. and BICES networks for GEOINT finished products. The software will provide releasable intelligence data to coalition users that support and partner with US forces to accomplish US policy goals in theater. \n\nGEOINT Rapid Development will resource contractor development and testing to deliver new GEOINT capabilities to the Army. Tasked work considers current warfighter intelligence gaps and develops potential solutions using tried and untried methodologies for collection, processing, and analysis alongside mission partner programs. The team then validates and tests approaches and delivers the techniques to the warfighter-supporting analyst team to support operations.\n\nIntelligence Needs Integration will resource contractor design, software development, and testing to populate ground component intelligence needs to external intelligence needs systems and provide the results to the ground component customers. Non-Army analysts can then provide intelligence using approaches not currently provided by the Army, giving the ground commander a greater resolution.\n\nThe GEOINT Product Catalog will resource contractor design, software development, testing and integration. The delivered software will provide analysts and requirements managers a guided, quick reference tool to choose from the hundreds GEOINT approaches available to close their intelligence gaps."

The software will provide releasable intelligence data to coalition users that support and partner with US forces to accomplish US policy goals in theater. \n\nGEOINT Rapid Development will resource contractor development and testing to deliver new GEOINT capabilities to the Army. Tasked work considers current warfighter intelligence gaps and develops potential solutions using tried and untried methodologies for collection, processing, and analysis alongside mission partner programs. The team then validates and tests approaches and delivers the techniques to the warfighter-supporting analyst team to support operations.\n\nIntelligence Needs Integration will resource contractor design, software development, and testing to populate ground component intelligence needs to external intelligence needs systems and provide the results to the ground component customers. Non-Army analysts can then provide intelligence using approaches not currently provided by the Army, giving the ground commander a greater resolution.\n\nThe GEOINT Product Catalog will resource contractor design, software development, testing and integration. The delivered software will provide analysts and requirements managers a guided, quick reference tool to choose from the hundreds GEOINT approaches available to close their intelligence gaps."

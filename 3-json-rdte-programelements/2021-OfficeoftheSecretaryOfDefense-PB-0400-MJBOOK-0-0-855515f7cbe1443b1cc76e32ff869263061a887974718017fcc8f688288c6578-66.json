The system measures in an objective, accurate, and timely manner the capability of the armed forces to carry out the National Security Strategy prescribed by the President, as well as the defense planning guidance provided by the Secretary of Defense and the National Military Strategy prescribed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  DRRS-S hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nDRRS-S is the evolution of readiness reporting to a more comprehensive system, better able to meet the Department\u2019s current and future readiness information challenges.  Included in these challenges is the expansion in scope of the entities who can, and do report readiness, as well as what they report.  Shifting from solely resource centric readiness reporting to a resource informed mission\/capabilities based reporting system, oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS), makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting, but portrays a far more relevant and holistic picture of readiness.  DRRS-S allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on the program\u2019s integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  Additionally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs.  DRRS-S continues to incorporate more data, and develop more capable functionality to meet the needs of both the operational employers of the Force, but also those responsible for Force Generation. \n\nFY2019 NDAA made revisions to Title 10 U.S. Code and provided the Department of Defense direction requiring growth in the DRRS-S program and identified the program\u2019s need to maintain the technical currency necessary to quickly meet future challenges associated with providing senior leaders with relevant and timely information.  Such initiatives include implementing the complex data structures and visualization tools needed to operationalize the Global Force Management - Data Initiative, and reporting at lower organizational levels consistent with how Forces are actually employed."

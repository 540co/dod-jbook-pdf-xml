            "val": "The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department\u2019s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense\u2019s \u201cTesting in a Joint Environment Roadmap\u201d to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to \u201ctest like we fight.\u201d  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability that supports system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing which otherwise would not be readily available to Service\/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs. By linking distributed facilities, as well as providing the necessary tools, services and subject matter expertise, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  \n\nIn 2012, the National Cyber Range (NCR) transitioned from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  The NCR mission is to provide secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments to conduct cyber test, experimentation, and training events.  The NCR supports a wide-range of customers performing Developmental and Operational Testing, Cyber Mission Force Training and Certification, and support for operational contingencies.  In FY 2016, the Department, as a result of a study conducted by DASD(C3&CB), recognized the magnitude of need for increased cyber test and training capacity and capability.  Based on this and other inputs, the Department increased funding in the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) in FY 17 to build out additional cyber T&E capacity based on the National Cyber Range (NCR) architecture.  This increased capacity will also be available to conduct training for the Cyber Mission Force.  The TRMC worked with the Services to identify facilities where this buildout could be accomplished most efficiently.  They also considered additional criteria such as accessibility by acquisition programs, availability of qualified work force, utilities and network availability, timing, and expected cost.  \n\nTo date, TRMC and the Services have identified five sites that are potential candidates.  We have begun detailed design in FY 17, to prepare for beginning the build-out in FY 18.  Once complete, the Department will have well over four times the cyber test and training capacity offered by the current NCR.\n\nThe Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department\u2019s lead for the JMETC program, the National Cyber Range, and oversees both their development and test conduct.  In order to meet the significant growth in requirements, TRMC will use the increased funding for FY 18 to substantially increase cyber test and training capacity by 1) refurbishing the current NCR hardware that is nearing end-of-life and increasing computing capacity to support additional customers; 2) procuring and fielding additional enterprise computational and storage resources for JMETC\u2019s Regional Service Delivery Points (RSDPs) capability; and 3) begin construction of a new high capacity cyber range similar to the NCR."

JMETC provides a test infrastructure consisting of the components necessary to conduct Joint distributed test events by cost-effectively integrating live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) test resources that are configured to support the users' needs.  The JMETC program provides its customers a support team to assist with JMETC products and the conduct of distributed testing.  JMETC\u2019s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  JMETC Program funding also provides JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&E.  JMETC has grown from four sites in 2007 to well over 100 functional sites by the end of FY17.  JMETC will reduce the cost and time to plan and prepare for distributed joint testing by providing a readily-available, persistent connectivity with network security accreditation support, common integration software for linking sites, and accredited test tools for distributed testing. To support its customers, JMETC also provides extensive expertise in planning, preparing for, and executing the infrastructure for distributed test events.  Additionally in FY 2013, the JMETC mission included developing and fielding the Regional Service Deliver Points (RSDP) to support testing and training.  The RSDPs are a set of distributed computing and storage platforms designed to efficiently meet DoD capacity and capability demands for distributed and cyber test and evaluation (T&E) requirements as part of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  They provide services (i.e. traffic generation, simulation, instrumentation, visualization, and integrated event management), a scalable architecture to increase capacity and capabilities as needed by the user community, a flexible and adaptable infrastructure to support users requirements which are prone to frequent change, and to deliver cost and performance efficiencies (virtualization, rapid reconstitution).  At a high-level architecture view, the RSDP adds enterprise compute and storage resources as well as a platform for distributed and cyber T&E tools and services at multiple classifications necessary to create high fidelity, operationally representative virtual environments, previously unavailable."

                            "val": "In FY 2013, responsibility for the National Cyber Range (NCR) was transferred to the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) and subsequently aligned under the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) Program Element.  Since then, the NCR has executed 200+ events for DOD Customers.  The NCR provides secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration\/federation of cyberspace test and evaluation (T&E) infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission. The NCR is accredited to operate at TS\/\/SI-G\/TK\/HCS-P\/\/SAR.  As a result of recent recapitalization and capacity enhancement efforts, the NCR now has the capability to support up to 8 concurrent events and scale up to ~250K virtual nodes. The NCR concurrently emulates complex (Red\/Blue\/Gray) operationally representative network environments at different classification levels using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) architecture. The NCR Test Automation Tool Suite minimizes human error, enables verification of test environment, ensures repeatable results and reduces event timelines from weeks\/months to hours\/days.  NCR computing assets can be sanitized after exposure to malicious attacks\/malware and restored to a known, clean state. The NCR conducts distributed events with other Cyberspace Ranges via the JMETC MILS Network (JMN) and Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR).\n\nThe NCR conducts Cyberspace Testing, Training and Operational Events for the full spectrum of DoD Customers including Research, Development, Acquisition, Testing, Training and Operational Cyber Mission Forces. The NCR executes wide variety of event types including Science and Technology (S&T) Demonstrations, Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E), Security Controls Assessments (SCA), Cyberspace Operations Training, Cyberspace Tactics, Techniques Procedures (TTP) Development, Forensics\/Malware Analysis) and Cyberspace Operations Mission Rehearsal.  The NCR enables acquisition programs to conduct Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation (T&E) in a representative Cyberspace Environment to identify and close exposed vulnerabilities, evaluate resiliency and positively impact program cost, schedule and performance.  The NCR also supports Training and Certification of Cyber Mission Forces in support of US Cyber Command by enabling operational forces to efficiently evaluate cyber warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment. Finally, the NCR is supporting in real time Overseas Contingency Operations as directed by National Authority.\n\nIn FY 2016, the Department, as a result of a study conducted by DASD(C3&CB), recognized the magnitude of need for increased cyber test and training capacity and capability.  Based on this and other inputs, the Department made the decision to increase funding in the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in FY 17 to build out additional cyber T&E capacity based on the National Cyber Range (NCR) architecture. This increased capacity will also be available to conduct training for the Cyber Mission Force.  The TRMC worked with the Services to identify facilities where this buildout could be accomplished most efficiently.  They also considered additional criteria such as accessibility by acquisition programs, availability of qualified work force, utilities and network availability, timing, and expected cost.\n\nTo date, TRMC and the Services have identified five sites that are potential candidates.  We have begun design and cost estimation in FY17 so that we can begin detailed design and begin build-out in FY 18.  Once complete, the Department will have well over four times the cyber test and training capacity offered by the current NCR.\n\nIn addition, the JMETC NCR Complex supports the Executive Agent for DoD Cyber Test Ranges."

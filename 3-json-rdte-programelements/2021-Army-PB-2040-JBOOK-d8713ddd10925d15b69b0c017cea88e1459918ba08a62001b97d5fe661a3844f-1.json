Current solutions to defeat these threats, Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Slat armor, do not provide preemptive or active protection and impose secondary blast hazards to crew, dismounted soldiers, and adjacent vehicles and equipment.  The Suite of Vehicle Protection Systems - EMD PE 0604852A will develop and mature solutions to increase the protection of the Army's ground systems from both current and next generation direct or indirect fired threat munitions.  \n\nThe Active Protection System will install and characterize Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Active Protection Systems on Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker demonstrator vehicles.  The Active Protection System effort will assess the maturity, performance, and integration risk of NDI Active Protection Systems, develop and refine Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker Active Protection System installation kit designs, and build prototypes necessary to conduct performance and safety testing to obtain an Active Protection System Urgent Materiel Release (UMR).  Active Protection System effort will execute installation design refinement and required testing to meet urgent fielding of NDI APS on Abrams, Bradley and Stryker pending Army leadership approval. The Active Protection System NDI effort served to inform the Vehicle Protection Suite Trade Study.\n\nThe Vehicle Protection Suite (VPS) Project (FE8) will design, mature, and evaluate combinations of active, reactive, and passive solutions and leverage both Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) principles and the Army's Modular Active protection system Controller (MAC) to develop tailored vehicle Survivability Sets that will mitigate existing protection gaps, allow for future technology insertion to meet evolving threats, and minimize the impact to the current capabilities hosted on Army ground system platforms."

Platform performance evaluation includes APS sensor assessments, minimum live threat characterization, surface danger zone characterization, co-site mitigation (antennas\/radiators), electromagnetic interference assessment\/characterization, energetic radiation assessment, and a durability assessment.  The NDI APS installation and characterization is being executed through a partnership between the US Army, NDI APS solution vendors, and prime contractors for Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker vehicles.  NDI APS vendor support, to include procurement of demonstration hardware, is contracted on a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) basis, while platform prime contractor technical support is provided on a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis.  The results from the installation and characterization effort has resulted in moving forward with installation design refinement and required testing to meet urgent fielding of NDI APS on Abrams and Bradley.  Characterization of APS solutions for Stryker revealed that while they were capable of intercepting threats, no solutions were suitable for Stryker.  Continued limited characterizations of APS solutions are planned to better understand their functionality, generate performance data, and determine if future integration onto a Stryker platform is feasible."

FY2016 and FY2017 funding is now documented in the exhibits for PE1203179F.\n\nThe IBS fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.\n\nIBS is comprised of the following:\n- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF (Ultra High Frequency) satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a Military Standard (MIL-STD) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). \n- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), all built to validated warfighter requirements.\n-- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network\/broadcast users. \n-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. \n\nThis PE funds:\n- Development\/upgrades of IBS (IBS-NS, CIB, and CMF) \n\nThis project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

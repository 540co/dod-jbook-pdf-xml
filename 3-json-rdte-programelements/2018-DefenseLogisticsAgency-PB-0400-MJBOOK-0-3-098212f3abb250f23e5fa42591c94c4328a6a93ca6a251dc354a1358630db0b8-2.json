            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, and combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate \u2013 including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLAs Generic Logistics R&D Technology Demonstrations (Log R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available to accomplish the agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources and applying the most effective business processes. The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs. The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  \n\nIn December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&D program in support of the agency\u2019s mission. As a result, the R&D program evolved from single supply chain efforts to Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs). The SFAs support DLA\u2019s efforts to make the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness rates in a constrained budget environment. \n\nThe three Strategic Focus Areas were renamed in FY 2021 to more clearly capture their focus and scope:  \n\n1. Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (formerly Analytic and Decision Support): R&D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.\n2. Improving Logistics Processes (formerly Logistics Processes): R&D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.\n3. Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements (formerly Innovative Products and Services for Customers): R&D Efforts to support emergent Logistics R&D requirements arising outside the budget cycle, a frequent occurrence.  The SFA begins new projects promptly without the disruption of ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes. \n\nNOTE: The single supply chain exhibits were removed as they are now included within the SFA exhibits."

This realignment was needed to accommodate high priority requirements within DLA to improve the industrial base that supports critical weapon systems. In FY17, $4.646M was realigned from LOG R&D to MANTECH for these high priority requirements.\n\nA full-year FY 2017 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, the budget assumes this account is operating under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2017 (P.L. 114-254).

These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible responsiveness to emerging market and customer requirements. Currently, there are three major analytical thrusts: Planning Processes, Medical Supply Chain, and Distribution\/Disposition. Planning processes model simulates item and customer demand patterns to improve customer support, lower inventories, acquisition costs, and acquisition lead-times for hardware (Class IX items). Medical Supply Chain Modeling will provide DLA the capability to integrate DLA logistics data and commercial data with satellite and political maps; it will automate for DLA Medical planners the ability to identify entities such as suppliers, customers and vendor distribution centers to enhance spatial awareness of incidents such as catastrophic events and military contingencies. The Strategic Distribution and Disposition (SDD) thrust will develop and implement analytical tools, models, and simulations of logistics and supply chain processes related to distribution and disposition.\n\nThe Medical Logistics Network will expand efforts in medical informatics, a growing area of health information systems that combines information science, computer science and health care to improve health systems to manage the healthcare supply chain more efficiently.  \n\nThe mission of the SDD program is to assist DLA Distribution and Disposition Services in anticipating, assessing, and meeting current and future Warfighter requirements by leveraging R&D to infuse innovative solutions. Current R&D thrusts include finalizing a simulation study for the Eastern Distribution Center (EDC), battery desulfation and lithium battery upgrade projects in support of DLA Distribution, and a Hazardous Waste (HW) disposal feasibility study in support of DLA Disposition Services"

This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs.  In the past DLA R&D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times.  Saving the lead-time allows the Agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs. Augmented reality is an emerging technology that has potential to advance to the forefront. Complete the Advanced Thermoelectric Technology  project to improve the current thermoelectric heater technology so it is more fuel-efficient, has an increased heating range, reduced maintenance requirements, and a longer service life. The Advanced Thermoelectric Heater will replace the existing Space Heater Convective standard heaters currently stocked at DLA, and will provide DoD a single, versatile heater that reduces the logistics footprint and satisfies the space heating requirements of expeditionary forces.\n\nIn FY18, the AM project will be funded under PE 0603680S \/ Manufacturing Technology Program (ManTech) Project 7 - Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (formerly Material Availability). This realignment will maintain continuity of funding and activity for this program.\n\nERP will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers."

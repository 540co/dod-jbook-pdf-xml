            "val": "Reliable and secure navigation and positive identification (ID) systems are essential elements of battle management in the naval environment.  The Photonics Imaging System (0253) is a non-hull penetrating replacement for existing optical periscopes.  The Photonics Imaging System exploits a wide portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum utilizing advanced Electro-Optic\/thermal imaging, and communications intercept\/Electronic Warfare Support (ES).  The Integrated Submarine Imaging System (ISIS) (0253) is a back fit system to integrate all imaging capabilities on existing submarine classes.  The Combat Identification System (CIS) project (1253) for Mark XIIA, and Improved Identification Development (0676) for AN\/UPX-29(V), covers the Mark XIIA Mode 5 upgrade to the existing Mark XII family of systems that is Joint and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) interoperable.  Per OSD direction, NATO participation is encouraged and performance data is exchanged to ensure the opportunity for interoperability with allied identification systems is maximized.  In addition to distinguishing friend from foe for weapons employment, the Navy requires secure, jam resistant Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems for battle group air defense management and air traffic control.  Identification is multifaceted and includes information received from several sensors (both cooperative and non-cooperative systems).  \n\nNavigation Satellite Timing & Ranging (NAVSTAR) Global Positioning System (GPS) project (0921) is a space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) system that provides authorized users with secure, worldwide, all weather, three dimensional position, velocity, and precise time data. NAVSTAR GPS supports Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2AD) by providing Assured PNT (A-PNT) capability to C4ISR and combat systems in standalone and networked architectures throughout air and maritime domains. This project is comprised of four distinct efforts: Air and Sea Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR), GPS-based PNT Service (GPNTS), and GPS Modernization. Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds are used to perform all the non-recurring GPS Surface Ship, Submarine and Aircraft Development, Integration, and Testing efforts in support of NAVSTAR GPS.\n\nThe Air and Sea NAVWAR programs were established to provide continued access to GPS information in a denied or impeded electronic environment. Development efforts for both programs provide improvements to various platform type antennas and ensure compatibility with the new Military Code (M-Code) signal. The Air NAVWAR program continues integration efforts using GPS Antenna System (GAS-1), Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP), and other anti-jam antennas on air platforms while investigating smaller anti-jam antennas for space constrained platforms and aircraft with unique requirements. The Sea NAVWAR program integrates Anti-Jam (AJ) antennas onto surface and subsurface platforms. Sea NAVWAR will continue to research the viability of smaller anti-jam antennas for space-constrained platforms and to support the Submarine Anti-Jam GPS Enhancement (SAGE) antenna development which integrates AJ capability into the submarine Multi-Function Mast (OE-538B) antenna system. \n\nGPS Modernization addresses the Navy's future integration of the GPS Directorate Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) products being developed by the Air Force that will enable the use of new GPS signals. This effort supports Navy compliance with Public Law 111-383 which mandates only M-Code capable receivers are to be procured after FY 2017. GPS Modernization consists of multiple parallel efforts that address the Navy's integration of multiple next generation GPS receivers that provide Naval air, surface, subsurface and weapon platforms improved access to GPS signals in challenged and jamming environments. Modernized GPS receivers will utilize the new M-Code GPS Signal in Space, incorporate enhanced cryptology, deliver greater position and time accuracy, and provide improved protection against signal spoofing. Additionally, GPS Modernization delivers increased GPS anti-jam protection and enables blue force GPS electronic attack. \n\nThe GPNTS system is being developed to replace stand-alone AN\/WRN-6 receivers, integrated Navigation Sensor System Interface (NAVSSI) systems, and integrated commercial-off-the-shelf GPS systems. Additionally, future capability will migrate toward a Common Computing Environment (CCE) such as Consolidated Afloat Networks Enterprise Services (CANES), and provide a path for the integration of advanced navigation systems and sensors. \nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under Engineering and Manufacturing Development because it includes those projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirement prior to full-rate production decision."

The Department of the Navy established the Integrated Submarine Imaging System (ISIS) to rapidly field the Type 18 periscope, Periscope Acquisition, Tracking, and Ranging with Improved Observation Techniques (PATRIOT) rangefinder, Type 8 Mod 4 Infra-Red (IR) periscope systems, and integrate existing periscope imagery systems into a single imaging system for installation on board SSN 688 class and SEAWOLF class submarines. The ISIS baseline also includes the Imaging System with the Photonics Mast (PM) and all configurations of Low Profile Photonics Mast (LPPM) onboard VIRGINIA and Photonics Mast Variant (PMV) onboard SSGN class submarines. The PM, LPPM, and PMV design exploit a wide portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum through advanced E-O and thermal imaging and Electronic Warfare Support (ES)\/communications intercept.  The Common Submarine Imaging System (CSIS) capability development document (CDD), that covers both ISIS and Legacy Imaging systems was approved 22 Dec, 2011.   The CDD is used to fully integrate the ISIS program of record into the submarines force rapid Technical Insertion\/Advanced Processor Build (TI\/APB) process and to incorporate Fleet-endorsed requirements such as the LPPM. Future mast development includes the Task-Oriented Technology Insertion Mast (TOTIM), which will provide 360 degree, non-rotating modular mast  with vastly increased capability, reduced maintenance costs and increased development flexibility for new mast sensors."

This project is comprised of four distinct efforts: Air and Sea Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR), GPS-based PNT Service (GPNTS), and GPS Modernization. Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds are used to perform all the non- recurring GPS Surface Ship, Submarine and Aircraft Development, Integration, and Testing efforts in support of NAVSTAR GPS. \n\nThe Air and Sea NAVWAR programs were established to provide continued access to GPS information in a denied or impeded electronic environment. Development efforts for both programs provide improvements to various platform type antennas and ensure compatibility with the new Military Code (M-Code) signal. The Air NAVWAR program continues integration efforts using GPS Antenna System (GAS-1), Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP), and other anti-jam antennas on air platforms while investigating smaller anti-jam antennas for space constrained platforms and aircraft with unique requirements. The Sea NAVWAR program integrates Anti-Jam (AJ) antennas onto surface and subsurface platforms. The Sea NAVWAR program will continue to research the viability and development of smaller anti-jam antennas for space-constrained platforms. The program continues to support the Submarine Anti-Jam GPS Enhancement (SAGE) antenna development which integrates AJ capability into the submarine Multi-Function Mast (OE-538B) antenna system. \n\nThe GPNTS system is being developed to serve as the primary PNT system for the Navy to ensure reliable PNT capability and interoperability insertion into GPS receivers and associated Command, Control, Computers, Communications and Intelligence (C4I), and Combat Systems in a denied environment. GPNTS provides precise PNT data required for combat, weapons, command, control, communications, navigation, and other systems, as well as providing the time synchronization critical to the network environments. GPNTS will back fit current PNT\/GPS systems as well as serve as a forward fit for new platforms. GPNTS will host the GPS Directorate-developed Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) card, allowing access to the new GPS M-Code signal. GPNTS will provide more robust and secure GPS\/PNT capabilities than is currently in the Fleet. The system will provide the capability to migrate non-real time GPS data toward a Common Computing Environment (CCE), such as Consolidated Afloat Networks Enterprise Services (CANES), and provide a path for the integration of advanced navigation systems and sensors. GPNTS supports Anti-Access\/Area of Denial (A2AD) by providing Assured PNT (A-PNT) capability to C4ISR and Combat Systems in standalone and networked architectures throughout maritime domains. \n\nGPS continues to be integrated in all DoD platforms and the development of enhanced and protected GPS is a national security priority. GPS Modernization executes the Navy's integration of Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) being developed by the Air Force GPS Directorate. This effort provides Navy platforms improved access to GPS signals in challenged and jamming environments. Because of the number and diversity of all of the Navy's air, surface, subsurface, and weapons platforms, this project will consist of multiple parallel efforts across many program offices with central coordination and management of funding and priorities by GPS Modernization. Modernized GPS receivers will utilize the new M-Code GPS Signal in Space, incorporate enhanced cryptology, deliver greater position and time accuracy, and provide improved protection against signal spoofing as compared to legacy receivers. Additionally, GPS Modernization delivers increased GPS AJ protection and enables blue force GPS electronic attack. This effort supports Navy compliance with Public Law 111-383 which prohibits spending funds on non-M-Code GPS user equipment after FY 2017. Initial NAVSTAR GPS Modernization efforts were funded by the Air Force in FY2015 and FY2016 as a joint effort with the Air Force GPS Directorate--the Department of Defense office for developing military user equipment. \n\nFY18 funds provide for Air NAVWAR to ramp up integration efforts and flight testing of anti-jam protection on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) platforms, for integration of anti-jam antennas into select aviation platforms in order to provide A-PNT in a GPS jamming environment, and for development and integration efforts of miniaturized NAVWAR antennas in AH-1Z, UH-1Y, MQ-4C and MQ-8B\/C. Sea NAVWAR funds provide for completion of development and integration of SAGE into the submarine OE-538B antenna system mast, initial government testing of the mast, and research for the development of smaller anti-jam antennas for Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) restricted platforms. \n\nIn FY18, GPNTS will ramp up efforts in preparation for Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) to include: coordination with Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) and the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) for Combat Systems Certification, Technical Evaluation, and Navigation Certification; prepare pre-test plans, procedures and documentation; complete an Operational Test Readiness Review; and prepare the test platforms.  An increase in funds provides for the development of the Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) technology insertion for software enhancements for Assured-Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (A-PNT) sensor suite integration and for the design, development, build, integration, and test of a single rack solution for smaller surface combatant platforms.\n\nFY18 growth in GPS Modernization funding requirements is due to award of prime vendor GPS integration contracts and procurement of production ready unit (PRU) modernized Military Code (M-Code) capable GPS receiver test articles for the platform integration and test activities of 3 platforms: FA-18E\/F, EA-18G, and E-2D, as well as the expansion of GPS Modernization efforts to include the start of government systems engineering and contracting efforts for 5 additional platforms: MV-22, CMV-22, E-6B, CH-53K, and KC-130. Each platform has a unique configuration, which requires separate parallel efforts to integrate and test the modernized GPS receiver into each platform, individual prime vendor contracts, and coordination with each PMA to include management, oversight and support of the effort."

Tasking includes overall centralized planning, coordination and budgeting of the non-recurring engineering required to conduct systems engineering, integration, and testing for multiple individual platform. This effort includes use of core expertise and platform program office government engineers to conduct systems engineering, review and oversight of prime vendor engineering documents, and develop government test plans.  The integration timeline is 5+ years from planning to test and is dependent on platform type.  Receivers will be procured through existing JSSMO contracts and integrated on Navy platforms using Prime vendor contracts held by each platform's program office. The MGUE card will be integrated into the receiver and tested by the prime vendor for each platform type.  Testing will be accomplished by leveraging test events existing in the platform's Program of Record (POR) upgrade cycle.  \n\nIntegration of MGUE provides access to the GPS M-Code to address emerging threats to use of GPS. This effort supports Navy's compliance with Public Law 111-383 which requires that all GPS user equipment be capable of receiving the new GPS M-Code signal after FY 2017."

IFF product improvements are designed to be installed through upgrade and deficiency correction studies, which in turn, become engineering changes to IFF interrogators and transponders and their associated cryptographic material.\n\nThe Navy MK XIIA Mode 5 program was approved for entry in Systems Development and Demonstration phase in August 2003 and into the Production and Deployment Phase and Low Rate Initial Production in July 2006, and Full Rate Production July 2012. The Navy Mode 5 program achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2012 in accordance with the ORD.  Mode 5 capable equipment was fielded in USN\/USMC platforms in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandums (047-07, 122-08 and 108-13) in support of Joint Mode 5 IOC in 2014 and is expected to meet Joint Full Operational Capability in FY2020.\n\nRDT&E articles include Mode 5 cryptographic modules and associated hardware and software changes for IFF interrogators and transponders, including, but not limited to: AN\/APX-118\/123, AN\/APX-119, and AN\/APX-111 equipment.

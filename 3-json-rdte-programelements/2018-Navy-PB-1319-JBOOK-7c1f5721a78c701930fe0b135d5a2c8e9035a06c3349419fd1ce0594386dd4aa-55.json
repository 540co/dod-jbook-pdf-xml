RAPT manages the requirements approval process via workflows and stores associated contract documentation. NET serves as the sole customer interface to the order-to-payment process for NMCI. NEST and its associated interfaces manage the lifecycle for NMCI IT services.\n\nDONAA IT \n\nThe Modernization Initiative includes multiple projects with RDT&E requirements:  Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC), Data Modernization & Analytical Tools, Knowledge Network (K-Net), Consolidated Law Enforcement Operations Center (CLEOC), and Data Modernization of the Secretariat Automated Resources Management Information System (SARMIS).  RDTEN funding will optimize DONAA's capability to make necessary improvements to various Secretariat systems.  This modernization will ensure compliance with continued financial emerging requirements.  Enhancement of financial auditability will be in compliance with DOD security system requirements.\n\nMULTIPLE THREAT ALERT CENTER (MTAC)\nThe Post-Cole Secretary of the Navy Anti-terrorism\/Force Protection Task Force identified the need for NCIS to enhance the Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC).  The MTAC provides key anti-terrorism\/force protection products in response to Fleet tasking and is critical to Fleet protection during current Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  This project provides funding for the development of an IT system to track the movement of NCIS special agents deployed in advance of DoN in-transit units.  The ability to track and communicate with these agents is necessary in order to forward threat data to those forward deployed agents and to task them to respond to emerging threats.  Funding is required for equipment and contractor support to modify COTS software.\n\nDATA MODERNIZATION & ANALYTICAL TOOLS\nNCIS data collection, filtering, and analysis infrastructure is unable to handle the increased flow of terrorism investigative and threat reporting of the Post 9\/11 era.  NCIS must revitalize its infrastructure and its data and investigation management capabilities to effectively counter current terrorist threats.  The three main components of this portfolio investment are data modernization, knowledge management, and investigation management.\n\nKNOWLEDGE NETWORK (K-Net)\nK-Net is a Data Modernization & analytical tool being developed and soon deployed that greatly enhances NCIS's technological arsenal.  K-Net implements an integrated NCIS approach for identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of NCIS's knowledge and expertise.  To that end, K-Net is a knowledge management system that improves NCIS's ability to search, analyze, fuse, and distribute both national intelligence and law enforcement information.  The envisioned end state for K-Net is a secure, intuitive, web environment that is the one stop shop where applications, data, and tools are easily accessible to all of NCIS users to effectively and securely fulfill their mission regardless of when and where they operate.\n\n\nCONSOLIDATED LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS CENTER (CLEOC)\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) enhancement of CLEOC will enable meeting Law Enforcement (LE) reporting requirements, satisfy Congressional mandates for the Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) and improve functionality across the Naval criminal justice community.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEM (DONCJIS)\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is the Executive Agent (EA) for the Department of the Navy Criminal Justice Information System (DONCJIS).  This system provides a cradle to grave criminal justice and law enforcement information system.  The system enables multiple communities within the DON to share criminal justice and law enforcement information.  Funding is required for contractor support to develop, test, train, deploy and implement this application.\n\n2903 NAVAIR IT\n\nJOINT CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (JCMIS)\nThe Joint Configuration Management Information System (JCMIS) Program is Department of Defense (DoD) standard software system for complete and integrated configuration management (CM) of weapon systems from acquisition to disposal.  JCMIS efficiently manages all product structure data, including complex interrelationship between assemblies and subassemblies, technical documentation and the parts that comprise the item.  JCMIS is designed to manage and control configuration data to support the DoD business processes.  Accurate, complete and accessible configuration data is critical to the successful operations of DoD weapon systems or tracked assets.  Mission readiness and operational capabilities are enhanced by JCMIS, as instant consistent integrated configuration data is readily available to operators, maintainers and logistics personnel.  This system is a CM tool available DoD wide to support all potential customers.  JCMIS provides users with a common database infrastructure to ensure compatibility, quality, and consistency of CM processes and provides configuration managers and analysts the validated CM information necessary for accurate maintenance, spare procurements, reliability and safety analysis, and mission readiness.  Funding is budgeted to support the services of re-hosting and testing of COTS upgrades to ensure objective performance of JCMIS is achieved.\n\nTASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING (TFCA)\nCyber Warfare consists of many different aspects to include sabotage of our weapon systems, networks as well as enablement of missions. Nation and non-nation state actors are acquiring and employing more advanced cyber-attacks in order to exploit our networks and aviation systems challenging our technological edge.  The threats and capabilities are real and range from exploiting capabilities, overloading weapons systems and logistics supply chains, to jamming signals or taking control of weapons systems.  We must defend against adversarial cyber-attacks while contributing to the exploitation of cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nTo meet these challenges and address the Chief of Naval Operations priorities and tasking, these research and development efforts are specifically focused on Naval Air Systems Command weapon or control systems and programs to ensure warfighting effectiveness as part of integrated \/ multi-platform kill chains.  These research and development efforts will strengthen our cyber posture by developing research, development, test and evaluation capabilities and solutions to deter, detect, and mitigate cyber threats and safeguard classified naval aviation systems and platforms from \"cradle to grave.\" These solutions will be integrated into the acquisition of weapons systems to enhance security, increase lethality, and improve resiliency in the expected operational environments.  Our weapon or control systems are unique in the aforementioned environments and mission, but also in the presence of numerous non-traditional access points and trusted cyber relationships required for operational environments.\n\n\nDIGITAL THREAD (DT)\nDigital Thread (DT) is digital process integration with complete, secure and authoritative data.  DT integrates the product life cycle, and includes all the processes that are needed to design, develop, test, produce, and support a product.   By connecting these processes, and using a standardized set of digital tools and data, the DT accelerates the product development cycle and lowers costs and for support and new capability integration.\n\n2904 NAVSEA IT\n\nThis program includes the funding for Information Technology (IT) support at NAVSEA for the development, support, and sustainment of maritime shore maintenance and includes multiple modernization efforts to insure effectiveness of Fleet maintenance systems as part of the current Navy Maritime Maintenance Enterprise Solution (NMMES).  These efforts include retirement and\/or replacement of costly legacy systems, transition planning and systems engineering for integration with national and enterprise interim and future solutions.  These efforts align with direction to insure that proposed interim solutions support a planned, single maintenance solution end state, as well as direction to align with data center consolidation plans proposed across the FYDP.  It includes the modernization of Naval Shipyard and Regional Maintenance Centers' Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) production tools.  This includes modifications\/enhancements to Shipyard IT systems, such as Advanced Industrial Management (AIM); Project Scheduling and Sequencing (PSS); Workload and Performance Systems; the COST and MAT systems, and other solutions such as the Electronic Technical Working Document (eTWD) Initiative.  The goal of PMO-IT is to provide modernization, migration and consolidation of obsolete legacy systems to the next generation of centrally hosted tools supporting Fleet Maintenance and national systems for the Navy.\n\n2905 BUPERS IT \n\nThe increase in the FY18 profile for 2905 stems from the decision to invest in programs that directly align with the Sailor 2025 vision.  The 2905 increases are tied directly to the Sailor 2025 pillars calling for modernization of the personnel system and transition to ready, relevant learning. The most significant spike stems from NSIPS, which in FY18 will complete its acquisition processes and award its first task order for Pay Modernization (PayMod), and also includes an add in support of the DoD Force of the Future for a Navy AC\/RC Permeability Solution to; (1) extend the reach for soliciting candidates for Navy jobs, (2) streamline the internal processes and supporting technologies to ensure timely payment for personnel who transition between AC, RC, Government civilian or contractor jobs, and (3) improve the Navy's ability to support Component Commanders with rapid requirements posting and talent acquisition for emergent needs.  The rest of the increase is largely due to the increase in the Learning Management System - Distance Learning (LMS-DL) program to transition the Collaborative Learning Environment Product from a limited prototype implementation to full production capability.\n\nBILLET BASED DISTRIBUTION (BBD)\n\nBBD increase in FY18 is a Sailor 2025 initiative aimed at modernizing distribution and order writing systems.  The effort begins functional work and follow-on development to collapse NROWS, NMCMPS, EAIS, and OAIS into a single distribution system.  The objective of BBD is to increase personnel readiness, improve fit and provide clear visibility to the impact on mission readiness at the billet level. BBD will facilitate maximizing the contributions of every member of the Navy workforce by delivering competency-based career paths.  \n\n\n\nLEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - DISTANCE LEARNING (LMS-DL)\n\nLMS-DL increase in FY18 is a Sailor 2025 initiative supporting ready relevant learning, with a focus to align Navy learning, create a career learning continuum, and leverage evolving technologies to expand learning solutions when and where the Sailor needs them.  The collaborative learning environment (CLE) is a key component within the learning IT strategy that leverages Commercial-Off-the-Shelf products to integrate the CLE with intelligent tutors, a multi-purpose reconfigurable training system (MRTS), electronic classrooms (ECR), trainers and labs, interactive multimedia instruction (IMI), instructors, and a virtual environment.  The increase in FY18 is to transition the pilot capability from FY17 into a production capability.  \n\nAs part of Sailor 2025 holistic IT approach, ready & relevant learning requires the development of a Learning Management System that permits:\n\n(1) Mobile & flexible delivery of modular training to the sailor\n(2) Synchronization of work requirements with learning modules to ensure proper training is delivered at the right time\n\nThis funding will develop and deploy new technologies for modularized training in fleet concentration areas to support the continuum of learning. This includes:\n\n(1) Development, modification or replacement of the current LMS platform\n(2) Integration of Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPTE) management tools to support end to end business processes (billet information, assignment, distribution, student management, learning management, personnel information, advancement) that will be impacted by changes to learning delivery and career profiles via Progressive NECs (e.g. TFMMS,NSIPS, Learning Assessment System, Navy Training Management Planning System) .\n\nThe Learning Management tools and supporting IT infrastructure must also be modified to support management of training into the Delayed Entry Program, the growing use of demonstration videos, social media, student and learning management for MPTE mobility efforts, gaming and simulation technology as it is brought on-line.\n\nLMS-DL will also introduce the Learning Continuum Pilot, a risk reduction effort that develops proof of concept alignment of sailor training requirements with learning content delivery.\n\nMY NAVY PORTAL (MNP)\nMNP is building an integrated web portal that consolidates the Navy's Human Resource portals, knowledge, and applications into a single and simplified user experience.  Through the use of a multi-phased development approach, MNP will provide an intuitive self-service single point of entry for Sailors to view and manage their personnel and career information.   MNP provides Active and Reserve Sailors with personalized interactive experiences and allows access to relevant information including learning content, human resource applications, and career business processes.\n\nMNP Phase 2C continues to mature eleven Career Life Event (CLE) capabilities.  Phase 2C continues requirements refinement work with key Fleet stakeholders and integrates or develops the identified CLEs.\n\nMy Navy Portal may address previously deferred requirements from prior phases. Should MNP exceed schedule\/delivery, planned follow-on phases or activities may be accelerated.  \n\nANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE\/ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (AOA)\nThe Navy will conduct multiple AoAs to analyze viable alternatives in order to determine the most efficient and effective solution to address the modernization of elements of the Navy's Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPTE) IT portfolio.  AOA will assess operational effectiveness, suitability, and costs of non-tactical systems to meet emerging capability requirements.\n\nNAVY STANDARD INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS)\n\nNSIPS increase in FY18 is aligned with the Sailor 2025 initiative to modernize personnel systems.  The substantial increase is attributed to the planned start of the Pay Modernization (PayMod) program, and also includes an add in support of the DoD Force of the Future for a Navy AC\/RC Permeability Solution to; (1) extend the reach for soliciting candidates for Navy jobs, (2) streamline the internal processes and supporting technologies to ensure timely payment for personnel who transition between AC, RC, Government civilian or contractor jobs, and (3) improve the Navy's ability to support Component Commanders with rapid requirements posting and talent acquisition for emergent needs. \n\nNSIPS facilitates the Navy's portion of the largest Federal PeopleSoft Human Resources implementation, providing the Navy with a systematic modernization of our web-based pay and personnel system - both afloat and ashore.  NSIPS collects, validates, processes and transfers the data necessary to ensure accurate and timely pay and maintenance of personnel records.  \n\nPay Modernization (Pay Mod) will integrate the PeopleSoft Global Payroll solution with Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) to provide an integrated Personnel and Pay solution for the Navy.  Pay Mod will improve efficiency by eliminating current Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) workarounds, improve business intelligence by providing real-time access to pay data, and improve auditability by having authoritative data in an integrated personnel and pay capability.  Pay Mod is a solution to make more efficient use of military member time and funding for pay of active and reserve personnel. \n\nDetermining the retirement eligibility for Navy active duty service with both Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) time is complicated by the fact the computation has to be performed manually and requires consultation with numerous data sources.  Current solutions make it difficult to account for who is on active duty at any point in time and time-in-grade calculations for Selected Reserve (SELRES) personnel.  Limitations in both payroll processes and systems induce a lapse between orders to effect change in status. SELRES personnel gained to Active Duty Special Work (ADSW) incur a delay in pay stemming from issues with loss\/gain timing in systems. SELRES personnel who re-enlist while on active duty orders are not retained when transitioning back to SELRES, and there is no retention of active duty Career History for Reserve personnel.  The Navy AC\/RC Permeability Solution will be included in the Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPTE) Transformation effort to leverage data in the authoritative data environment, modernize personnel and pay systems, and provide modern commercial solutions to; (1) extend the reach for soliciting candidates for Navy jobs, (2) streamline the internal processes and supporting technologies to ensure timely payment for personnel who transition between AC, RC, Government civilian or contractor jobs, and (3) improve the Navy's ability to support Component Commanders with rapid requirements posting and talent acquisition for emergent needs.\n\nNAVY MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS SYSTEM (NMRS)\n\nNMRS will modernize obsolete software and incorporate a wide array of enhancements (expanded capabilities based on sponsor's approved Functional Requirements Document) of new capabilities in support of Manpower Requirement efficiencies. Should NMRS deliver early, planned follow-on phases may be accelerated.\n\nNMRS is a key tool which Navy manpower managers rely on to set, implement, and execute manpower requirements. Recommendations for improving data bases and the Navy's mobilization capacity rely on NMRS to make strength determinations.  The planned effort also includes technical evaluation and integration of products produced by the Simulation Toolset for Analysis of Mission, Personnel and Systems (STAMPS) program.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION (RMI)\nThe RMI program is a consolidation of DON risk management requirements into a single Program of Record (POR) to provide modern safety reporting and management capabilities for both active and reserve Navy and Marine Corps commands. RMI enables agile responses to business rule changes, automation of routine actions, improved data integrity, and facilitates self-service for organizations and individuals.\n\nRMI is being developed in three increments of capabilities: Streamlined Incident Reporting (SIR), Safety Program Management (SPM), and Analysis & Dissemination (A&D).  A fourth requirement, Single Point of Entry (SPOE), will be accomplished as part of the development of the three RMI increments since each will be built on the same Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) platform.  Each of these capabilities will be acquired as individual Abbreviated Acquisition Programs using an incremental development approach for reengineered business processes, while consolidating five legacy systems [Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS), Enterprise Safety Application Management Systems (ESAMS), Portsmouth Occupational Accident and Illness Reporting System (POAIRS), Medical Mishap and Compensation (MMAC), and Injury Tracker (INJTRK)]. \n\nAUTHORITATIVE DATA ENVIRONMENT (ADE)\n\nADE increase in FY18 is a Sailor 2025 initiative aimed at transitioning the current project based ADE into a full enterprise solution that is based on modern IT service models and cloud hosting technology.  This specific increase will advance data analytics and visualization capabilities, and add common platform services in a big data environment that is consistent with private industry.  This acceleration toward a true Navy-wide personnel authoritative data environment is a transformational increase in capability for decision support and improving personnel readiness.  \n\nAs part of the Sailor 2025 strategy, the Chief of Naval Personnel has directed an acceleration of expansion and development of the ADE and improvements in making MPTE data more available to commanders, sailors, business owners and MPTE and fleet executive leadership.  The ADE provides infrastructure, operations and sustainment of the Navy MPTE Authoritative Data Warehouse(ADW), enterprise service bus, and web support services. \n\nThe capabilities delivered by this funding includes the following:\n     (1) Completed \"golden record\" expansion increments\n          - Data quality\n          - Governance\n          - Security\n          - Data standardization\n     (2) Increased capabilities for MPTE supply chain & business operations\n          - Data discovery\n          - Advanced visualization tools\n          - Predictive analytics\n     (3) Enhanced architecture to support unstructured data and \"big data\" analytics\n     (4) Improved support for future identity management & access for mobile device capability\n\nAPPLICANT RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (ARM)\nARM provides automated support of the management of recruiting information. ARM enables all levels of recruiting to have real-time access to timely and accurate information. ARM provides managers with decision-making support by consolidating Navy Recruiting Command (NRC) legacy application systems. The complete ARM Systems Dev\/Mod effort will incorporate biometrics and paperless implementation across all lines of business systems to gain additional efficiencies. \n\nIncluded in the ARM program is the Self Service Accessions Application (SSAA). Phase II of this effort will build the SSAA application into the ARM system. SSAA is a mobile device-based software application. SSAA supports a change in the NRC business processes from a recruiter-driven business model to an applicant self-service business model. This \"app\" will be used by applicants to collaborate with recruiters anytime & anywhere to more efficiently and effectively navigate the recruiting process.\n\n3167 JOINT TECHNICAL DATA INTEGRATION (JTDI)\n\nFunding supports the evaluation, testing and integration to develop a JTDI Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for installation on a Carrier (CV) and Amphibious Assault (L) class ships and up to 104 Navy\/Marine Corp aviation activities.  JTDI is a digital technical data access, delivery and local O&I level library management toolset and telemaintenance collaboration process enabler.  It improves accuracy and timeliness of technical manual and other technical data delivery and minimizes the Fleet's library management burden.  JTDI reduces maintenance work hours with saving Return on Investment (ROI) of 2.5:1.  It facilitates the transition of the Joint Distance Support and Response (JDSR) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) for telemaintenance and provides for process efficiencies to support ongoing Aviation Fleet Technical Representative reductions.  \n\nMARINE AVIATION LOGISTICS ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (MAL-EIT)\nFunding supports the evaluation, development, testing and integration of software and hardware solutions across all US Marine Corps Aviation activities to be used in the planning and execution of geographically distributed, expeditionary Aviation Logistics (AVLOG) chains in support of deployed USMC Air Combat Element operations.  The Marine Aviation Logistics Enterprise Information Technology (MAL-EIT) Program is one of four programs contained within the Marine Aviation Logistics Support Program (MALSP) modernization program known as MALSP II.  Legacy MALSP is nearly 25 years old and grossly inadequate in IT capability to meet the informational, planning, and C2 needs of a dynamic, geographically distributed nodal AVLOG system.  MAL-EIT is a Defense Business System Abbreviated Acquisition Program that will develop and deliver the required IT capability necessary to eliminate the IT related gaps existing in the legacy MALSP.\n\n3185 JOINT AIR LOGISTIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (JALIS)\n\nJALIS is an operational scheduling and aircraft management system that facilitates real-time data analysis.  JALIS is a critical element in the management of DoD air logistics assets.  JALIS allows:\n\n     (1) DoD Service Personnel to submit airlift requirements for DoD Personnel and cargo\n     (2) Air Logistics Flying Units to communicate their aircraft availability in a real-time graphic display\n     (3) Designated Scheduling Organizations to compare airlift requirements with available aircraft\n     (4) Designated Scheduling Organizations to create mission assignments\n\nJALIS informs applicable users of mission details and modifications by using a combination of system displays and email updates.  JALIS is geographically distributed and has a user base in excess of 4,000 members.  JALIS facilitates the movement of thousands of DoD Personnel and tons of cargo annually in support of the following:\n\n     (1) Navy Unique Fleet Essential Airlift\n     (2) Army's Operational Support Airlift Agency (OSAA)\n     (3) United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)\n     (4) United States Marine Corps (USMC)\n\n9406 MAINTENANCE DATA WAREHOUSE\n \nAviation Data Warehouse Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation (DECKPLATE) - The development of the DECKPLATE program is the next generation data warehouse for aircraft maintenance, flight, and usage data. It provides a web-based interface to a single source of information currently being stored in multiple Naval Aviation Logistics Data Analysis systems.  Through the use of analysis, query, and reporting tools the user has the capabilities to effectively obtain readiness data in a near real-time environment, as well as providing historical data for long range planning, trend analysis and records analysis, records reconstruction, and compliance with technical directives.  DECKPLATE supports the mission of the warfighter who requires a single source of near real-time aviation data in which to base critical readiness decisions. This requires collecting data from authoritative sources into a data warehouse.  Because the warfighter only needs to access one database, the time consuming task of collecting various pieces of data from various sources will be reduced and ultimately eliminated.  This improves data quality because it reduces the possibility of two systems providing identical data elements, but slightly different data. Data availability is improved through continuous near real-time feeds from the data sources,  giving the warfighter the most current information to base decisions.  In addition, this also accomplishes a reduction in legacy systems mandated by Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. DECKPLATE manages total inventory for two major categories of assets, Aircraft and Engine\/Propulsion Systems\/Modules (EPSMs).DECKPLATE is comprised of the Aircraft Inventory and Readiness Reporting (DECK-AIRRS) and the Engine Transaction Reporting (DECK-ETR) subsystems which provide the complete lifecycle for aircraft and Engine\/ Propulsion System\/Modules (EPSMs). Both DECK-ETR and DECK-AIRRS are undergoing a FISCAM assessment (FY16) and audit (FY17) and are undergoing review for designation as the Accountable Property System of Record (APSR) for aircraft and uninstalled engines.\n\nCONDITION BASED MAINTENANCE PLUS (CBM+)\nThrough automated analysis and decision making processes, the CBM+ Initiative provides Naval Aviation Enterprise with common enabling capabilities which deliver timely data-driven decisional information to optimize aircraft availability and materiel readiness by incorporating health and usage leading indicators into the failure mode mitigation process, enabling the Warfighter to more efficiently meet mission requirements.  The CBM+ Initiative increases readiness by streamlining maintenance processes, provide the sustainment base with timely, actionable logistics data not previously available, and enable engineers and acquisition professionals to support system improvements based on CBM+ acquired data results.   CBM+ provides the enabling solutions needed to extend the life of current and new acquisition aircraft, realizing savings from reductions in field (organizational and intermediate) maintenance actions, reduced functional check flight hours, mishap mitigation, and reduced parts usage.  \n\nINTEGRATED LOGISTICS SUPPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ILSMS)\nThe development of the ILSMS program is the next generation analytical tool set for Unit, Aircraft, Engines, Component Readiness and Cost metrics.  It will be a web-based tool that will provide the user with validated and aggregated data.  ILSMS provides analysts with the means to pull data on type\/model\/series (TMS) readiness, run detailed component analysis, manage aircraft life by bureau number, request lists of TMSs' top degraders, model the impacts of degraded components on readiness and cost, generate production scenarios, and manage the incorporation of technical directives. ILSMS institutionalizes a data analysis process that is repeatable and establishes a common understanding of readiness and cost degraders among its users.  This is also the foundation for working with provider organizations to establish metrics, actionable mitigation plans and milestones. ILSMS will give its users a one stop shop to proactively identify readiness and cost degraders quickly with a consistent methodology across all TMS thus providing a standardized tool to assist programs in reducing total ownership costs.  \n\n9999 CONGRESSIONAL ADD\n\nCongressional Add (Project C286): The enterprise Product Lifecycle Management (ePLM) Integrated Decision Environment (IDE) will serve as a central knowledge repository for process and product evolution and history. It will promote integration, data exchange, and analysis among all business users and information systems that will interact with any Weapon System Configuration Item (CI) during its lifecycle. ePLM IDE enables product support providers and the warfighter to maintain weapon systems in the most ready condition at the lowest lifecycle cost by linking readiness and cost impacts with every decision. The ePLM IDE will effectively address each weapon system program requirement for an IDE as stated in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook."

DON\/AA employs this system to support financial and resource decisions for the entire Secretariat.  SARMIS produces budget materials and analysis, as well as generating allocation data. In addition, SARMIS contains organizational manpower data that assists our leaders in making necessary personnel decisions for the Secretariat. This RDTEN funding will optimize DON\/AA's capability to make necessary modernization to various Secretariat systems in order to ensure compliance with FIAR and other financial emerging requirements of a clean financial statement.  This modernization will provide transparency and enhance the level of financial auditability in the system.  RDTEN funding is required to support systems technology upgrades and DOD security system requirements.\n\nCORB IT System Modernization:\nThe CAPS-II programs is used by the Navy Clemency and Parole Board (NCPB) and the Combat Related Special Compensation Board(CRSC) to process and adjudicate approximately 3,200 cases per year.  The current system defects have resulted in additional man-hours and reduced reporting functionality.  This has created a longer manual process, and hinders adequate and accurate statistical data from being collected or retrieved.  RDTEN funding will be used to modernize the CAPS-II program in order to meet current IT standards and enhance system capabilities.  The system is currently non-serviceable and is not aligned with NCPB and CRSC current mission requirements.\nDON TRACKER  \n\nDepartment of the Navy Tasking, Records and Consolidated Knowledge Enterprise Repository (DON TRACKER - formerly known as Enterprise Records and Task Management (ERTM)) is a single, auditable, compliant Records and Task Management process, implemented uniformly across all DON Divisions and Commands, and administered by DON\/AA, to enable efficient and effective execution of Records Management (RM) and Task Management (TM) policy in compliance with statute.\n  \nELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM (ePS)\n\nThe electronic Procurement System (ePS) is the Department of the Navy's (DON) End-to-End (E2E) Contract Writing System (CWS).  It will provide the Navy and Marine Corps contracting community with a full contract writing management capability and facilitate integration with federally mandated systems, DON financial systems, and industry.  The ePS will utilize Department of Defense (DoD) standards and support auditability.  The ePS will address existing CWS challenges including outdated architecture, limited capabilities, scalability concerns, and existing legacy systems.\n\nFull deployment of the ePS ensures compliance of the DON's contracting abilities with the following legislative mandates: the writing and management of all contracts must now occur in congressionally approved computer systems (Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013); the central management and oversight of all DoD business (10 U.S. Code (U.S.C.)  Section 2222); and all contracting actions must be fully auditable and traceable (Section 1003 of the NDAA 2010 & Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance).   \n\nThe ePS will use DoD data exchange capabilities (e.g.; Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Purchase Request Data Standard (PRDS)) in order to achieve standardized data interoperability with external systems.  The Navy Enterprise Service Bus (NESB) serves as the hub to relay procurement data to various finance and other systems of record, such as Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (Navy ERP), Standard Accounting & Reporting System (STARS) and Standard Accounting Budgeting & Reporting System (SABRS). \n\nIn FY18, the Program will continue systems engineering and interface mapping efforts, as well as support of software hosting and the start of the Limited Deployment (LD) phase of the ePS program. The Product Demonstration and Evaluation (PD&E) process will also be initiated to evaluate performance and usability of EPS product.  \n\nThe result of successful ePS implementation will be a contracting workforce that issues accurate and timely contracts in a standard format that comply with all DoD\/Federal laws, regulations, and policies.\n\nNMCI ENTERPRISE SERVICE TOOLS SET\nThe NMCI Enterprise Service Tools (NEST) is the NMCI IT service management system that supports the Navy IT service lifecycle business workflow. The NEST currently is comprised of two government owned tools, the NMCI Enterprise Tool (NET) and the Requirements to Award Process Tool (RAPT), which enables and manages the business workflow. NET is a custom .NET application that has been built and maintained by the DON to support ordering of IT services. RAPT manages the requirements approval process and stores supporting documentation for previously unpriced line items. RAPT provides NET with relevant identification information for the new orderable solution, which supports the creation of orderable services. NET serves as the single point of entry for lifecycle management of IT services on the NMCI network."

NO ACAT\n\nThe selected contractor must have knowledge of the existing information systems pertinent to the task.  They must also have the corporate experience and a staff of knowledgeable personnel to provide the required services.  The task will be monitored by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), who reviews technical data submissions, system deliverables, and invoices to ensure acceptable contractor performance and scheduled deliveries.\n\nCORB IT System Modernization: \nContract will be awarded under a competitive, all source, RFP.  NO ACAT\n\nDON TRACKER\n\nAs a general rule, IT development programs use an agile software development methodology therefore milestones, tasks and phases are often conducted in parallel vice sequentially.\n\nThis planned acquisition will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to a selected Vendor in support of sustainment, software development, legacy data transfer, and additional fielding of the DON TRACKER application.\n\nELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM (ePS)\nThe ePS program intends to award a 10-year hybrid contract to a single System Integrator (SI).  The SI (Prime) will provide required software licenses and required activities for program management, maintenance, systems engineering, design and interface development, testing, deployment, training, and support documentation.  This includes all efforts through Full Deployment (FD) and continued sustainment support during the 10-year period of performance.  \n\nThe ePS will leverage Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products and capabilities, and is anticipated to consist of three components to achieve full end-to-end capability: 1) a COTS Contract Writing System (CWS) solution; 2) a COTS middleware interfacing capability, known as an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB); and 3) Gap-closure methodologies (e.g.; Business Process Management (BPM) tools, Business Process Re-Engineering (BPR), COTS updates, or a secondary COTS solution).\n\nThe ePS acquisition strategy has been revised to move the risk reduction Product Demonstration and Evaluation (PD&E) phase into source selection rather than after award.  This updated strategy adjusted the anticipated award date to Q4 FY18, and is expected to reduce the risk associated with gap-closure and establish user buy-in and ownership of the solution.\n\nNMCI ENTERPRISE SERVICE TOOLS (NEST)"

JCMIS efficiently manages all product structure data, including complex interrelationship between assemblies and subassemblies, technical documentation and the parts that comprise the item. JCMIS is designed to manage and control configuration data to support the DoD business processes.  Accurate, complete and accessible configuration data is critical to the successful operations of DoD weapon systems or tracked assets.  Mission readiness and operational capabilities are enhanced by JCMIS, as instant consistent integrated configuration data is readily available to operators, maintainers and logistics personnel.  This system is a CM tool available DoD wide to support all potential customers.  JCMIS provides users with a common database infrastructure to ensure compatibility, quality, and consistency of CM processes and provides configuration managers and analysts the validated CM information necessary for accurate maintenance, spare procurements, reliability and safety analysis, and mission readiness.  Funding is budgeted to support the services of re-hosting and testing of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) upgrades to ensure objective performance of JCMIS is achieved.  This program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION because it includes those projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirement prior to full-rate production decision.\n\nTask Force Cyber Awakening (TFCA)- Cyber Warfare consists of many different aspects to include sabotage of our weapon systems, networks as well as enablement of missions. Nation and non-nation state actors are acquiring and employing more advanced cyber-attacks in order to exploit our networks and aviation systems challenging our technological edge.  The threats and capabilities are real and range from exploiting capabilities, overloading weapons systems and logistics supply chains, to jamming signals or taking control of weapons systems.  We must defend against adversarial cyber attacks while contributing to the exploitation of cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nTo meet these challenges and address the Chief of Naval Operations priorities and tasking, these R&D efforts are specifically focused on Naval Air Systems Command weapon or control systems and programs to ensure warfighting effectiveness as part of integrated \/ multi-platform kill chains.  These research and development efforts will strengthen our cyber posture by developing research, development, test and evaluation capabilities and solutions to deter, detect, and mitigate cyber threats and safeguard classified naval aviation systems and platforms from \"cradle to grave.\" These solutions will be integrated into the acquisition of weapons systems to enhance security, increase lethality, and improve resiliency in the expected operational environments.  Our weapon or control systems are unique in the aforementioned environments and mission, but also in the presence of numerous non-traditional access points and trusted cyber relationships required for operational environments.\n\nDigital Thread - Digital Thread (DT) is digital process integration with complete, secure and authoritative data.  DT integrates the product life cycle, and includes all the processes that are needed to design, develop, test, produce, and support a product.   By connecting these processes, and using a standardized set of digital tools and data, the DT accelerates the product development cycle and lowers costs and for support and new capability integration."

These maintenance activities support Fleet operations 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The NMMES IT solution is used by over 40,000 civilians and military who conduct over $6.5B of ships maintenance and modernization on an annual basis.  The NMMES program includes sustainment as well as multiple modernization efforts to insure the continued effectiveness of the Fleet maintenance IT toolset. These efforts consists of adding mandatory enhancements, such as Financial Audit Improvement Readiness (FIAR) changes and aligning with the Standard Accounting Budget Reporting System (SABRS) system.  The NMMES program provides for software changes, retiring and\/or replacing of costly legacy systems, transition planning, and systems engineering for integration with existing and future solutions. These efforts align with direction to insure that proposed interim solutions support and facilitate the transition to the planned, maintenance solution end state. This program will provide modernization, migration, testing, and consolidation of obsolete legacy systems to the next generation of centrally hosted tools supporting Fleet Maintenance systems for the Navy.\n\nIncrease in funding addresses critical deficiencies and minimizes the inherent risks that a catastrophic systems failure would be to fleet readiness.  The increase in funds is required to support the modernizations of products that are on outdated software and to enhance the existing applications to make them cloud capable.  It also provides for software enhancements required to make applications Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) compliant and to enable system modifications of financial feeder applications to interface with a FIAR compliant system of record.  The requirement to handle 3-D integrated product models being delivered with CVN-78 and Virginia Class are also driving the increase.  NAVSEA plans to execute these funds primarily through a current sustainment contract and several separate contracts through existing delivery orders to gain the specialized resources and material necessary to sustain these vital systems until they can be replaced by fully fielding the NMMES Technical Refresh (TR) solution.  There is an overlapping period of time where both solutions are operating and requiring sustainment, hence the increase in the requested amounts for current systems and subsequent replacement system(s).  An increase to NMMES-TR in FY18 will accomplish the following work increments: 1) the development and implementation of a Work Brokering solution that addresses both public and private yards for planning to be completed in FY20; 2) the architecture, engineering, design and delivery of an Enterprise Services Bus (ESB) network\/interfacing to provide for the support and transition from the NMMES solution to the NMMES-TR solution; 3) the planning and preparation for the acquisition, configuration, and deployment of the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) replacement solution TR increment.  An integrated approach of supporting sustainment of current systems and ramping up the Technical Refresh in FY18 reduces risk of development and deployment of critical systems supporting ship maintenance."

This solution will provide paperless work packages, pulling authoritative data from the existing NMMES Family of Systems supporting ship maintenance.

The overall goal for eTWD is twofold:  1) to reduce the resources and time preparing, executing and certifying work instructions; and 2) enable the non-stop execution of work by having online documents and access to problem resolution.  The eTWD Initiative is in progress."

Key system objectives include: 1) Standardization of the scheduling processes and tools; 2) Creation of dates for use in the NMMES project management software; 3) Generation of user and management reports covering all aspects of scheduling of a ship or submarine availability.   The current PSS application is based on a 1980s proprietary commercial product originally acquired over 25 years ago.  The application is outdated and the vendor has informed the Navy that it will no longer be supported in the near future requiring Navy to pursue an immediate upgrade to a supportable product, while not interrupted maintenance availabilities.  The product had already become increasingly difficult to maintain and with the pending loss of vendor support could lead to catastrophic system failure and loss of ability to maintain project schedules.  The PSS Upgrade will convert the system from the Robbins-Gioia CAT proprietary solution to the Robbins-Gioia Jaguar 2020 (J2020) solution and improve the web-basing of the system."

Two additional systems; 1) Performance Measurement and Control (PMC) and Quality Performance System (QPS) are interfaced with SPF to produce the staffing, planning and performance measurement necessary to successfully accomplish work in navy industrial activities.   All three of these systems have known software deficiencies which limit productivity and require cumbersome manual workarounds.  Historically to effectively operate and meet mission needs. The shipyards and RMCs have supplemented this suite with additional local spreadsheet and databases, adding to the complexity of this aging solution.   One goal of the SPF Upgrade is to eliminate these ad hoc databases and unify the solution to effectively operate in the targeted data center environment.  \nThe SPF Upgrade is part of the next Service Life Extension that will address the accumulation of significant problems with this system, update the software platform, provide integrated metrics capabilities across shipyards and include access of data to headquarters' planners.  The SPF Upgrade will include add a modern database architecture and a fully functioning data warehouse environment that will eliminate the weekend long running of PMC jobs that hinders efficiency and productivity. The Upgrade will eliminate the currently required manual interfaces with other NMMES systems to produce a seamless real-time environment that can accommodate all project management metrics, as well as all ship maintenance related metrics.  Additionally, it will eliminate the manual data gathering and consolidation required to produce Shipyard Interim Metrics; and eliminate the need for Headquarters and each shipyard to maintain their own unique standalone data files."

                                        "val": "The current Navy Maritime Maintenance Enterprise Solution (NMMES) toolset enables the execution of submarine, aircraft carrier, and surface ship maintenance and repair for the Naval Shipyards (NSY), Intermediate Maintenance Facilities (IMF), Regional Maintenance Centers (RMC), Trident Refit Facilities (TRF), and Ship Repair Facilities (SRF).  It consists of a family of systems and applications that are at (or nearing) their end-of-life.  These systems and applications support a workforce of over 51,000 worldwide and enable approximately $9.5B per year of maintenance and repair work.  The critical business processes to schedule, execute, monitor, certify work, and pay employees at each activity are codified within the Information Technology (IT) toolset; there is no manual alternative.\nNavy has conducted two Service Life Extensions for the current NMMES toolset, and is executing multiple enhancements to maintain its cyber security and operational effectiveness.  The current IT toolset requires significant annual investment to maintain its status quo and reactively patch cybersecurity shortfalls; however, even with this investment, many of the underlying issues with the current toolset will not be resolved.  Annual efforts to restore the NMMES budgets to meet requirements have only been partially successful and have required multiple annual supplemental actions to address deficiencies.  The urgency to modernize these systems has grown every year as deferred upgrades and underfunded sustainment has led to the current state of the NMMES toolset, which is not adaptable, reliable, supportable, affordable, nor maintainable.  Failure to replace the toolset will increase the likelihood of IT related maintenance delays for submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface ships directly impacting fleet readiness for meeting national priorities.   Also, due to the inflexibility of the NMMES status quo toolset, desired Business Process Reengineering (BPR) functional enhancements (e.g., financial audit compliance, data analytics, ability to interface with digital shipbuilding environment) have not been possible.  \n\nThe NMMES-TR is a pre-Milestone A acquisition program that will provide a sustainable enterprise IT solution leveraging Commercial, Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology and business processes for shore maritime maintenance, which also standardizes processes and tools.  Unlike the uniquely custom designed status quo toolset, the NMMES-TR solution will not implement product customization to match the current maintenance business processes; but rather, maintenance business processes will be modified to match the solution, thereby adopting industry best practices.  Accordingly, the solution will be more flexible to the BPR process, and more agile to capitalize on efficiency improvement opportunities and innovations.  This will facilitate alignment with the Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP) by assisting the maintenance activities with accomplishing assigned tasks as planned in order that submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface ships can properly train and deploy on schedule.  NMMES-TR will also provide a modern solution that will be more effective and efficient in combating cybersecurity threats, and capable of continuous monitoring.  The actual solution will be formed after the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)."

These systems are targeted for modernization to address the FOUR mandatory requirements: 1) meeting FISCAM and auditability requirements; 2) transitioning COST to interface with SABRS, vice STARS-FL no later than 30 September 2017; 3) as both these systems are COBOL-based -  COST, utilizes a 1990s era Case tool (PACBASE) to generate COBOL-ready code. In 2015 vendor support for the PACBASE tool was transitioned to an IBM subsidiary in France (who in 2016 informed the Navy that support for the tool would end by 2018), hence without this tool the COST system must be refreshed in order to operate; and 4) the rapid increase in the cost of gaining sufficient COBOL licenses to operate these two systems in support of fleet maintenance has also created emerging execution year budget challenges for the Navy to such an extent that it is now more feasible to immediately transition these systems to a non-COBOL solution than to continue in the current licensing structure.  Hence, the Financial Technical Upgrade is to address these four urgent needs in order to continue operation of the NMMES Family of Systems beyond 2018."

MATmf provides quantitative, financial, and status information on industrial materials. It monitors the shop stores in the shipyard and assesses the direct material inventories. \nThe MATmf system has reached end-of-life and is operating on software components that are considered obsolete. A Service Life Extension is required to support the future capabilities (i.e. eTWD requirements), to correct sustainability issues, and to improve the ability to support current and future ships maintenance. While the upcoming MSE releases will consolidate application databases (including MATmf into a data center environment); it does not include material integration across shipyards nor provide usable real time material information or metrics across the ship maintenance community. The MSE releases will also not convert the outdated development code, eliminate the time cumbersome manual batch processing, nor fix a host of long term shortcomings affecting the efficiency of the system (including long time printing limitations affecting for Material Control Tags and waterfront performance).  Over the past 5 years, NAVSEA 08 and the Corporate Material Process Action Team through multiple LEAN events has identified and documented many areas that need enhancements. Some of these include:  1) the ability to allow for Fiscal Year rollover of JMLs, 2) the ability to allow redistribution of bulk receipt inspected materials to other shipyards, 3) the ability to report transactions for BP28 assets, 4) improve the ability to create efficient processes for receipt of RFI tagged material into Shop Stores, 5) improve receipt of shipyard contracts into shipyard for receipt inspection, 6) allow DLR material in Shop Stores, 7)  address transition to another handheld scanner as the current handhelds are no longer available for purchase.  These deficiencies will be addressed in the Material Management Upgrade."

The Navy Maritime Maintenance Enterprise Solution (NMMES) Initiative funds the sustainment of deployed systems, as well as the modernization and selected technology refreshment of ship maintenance systems. These existing core ship shore maintenance systems, which are integral to shore ship repair activities, reside in the naval shipyards, regional maintenance centers, ship repair facilities, Supervisors of Shipbuilding, and other industrial activities throughout the world.  The present capabilities for this aging Family of Systems continue to require a challenging level of maintenance support. They require information assurance upgrades, selective modernization and\/or enhancement to address technological obsolescence and to remove cumbersome work practices to gain efficiencies; and continual protection of Naval Nuclear Propulsion information. These efforts are required to minimize the risk of systems failure that may directly prevent the fleet from operating at its full potential due to interruptions of the Intermediate and Depot level maintenance activities. These NMMES managed systems support over $9B yearly in ship maintenance and modernization and a military\/civilian workforce of over 50,000 personnel supporting worldwide operations.  These systems are presently undergoing a second Service Life Extension (SLE) to address cyber security deficiencies, consolidate and align databases across multiple data instances, and to transition the NMMES Family of Systems supporting fleet maintenance into an approved Navy Enterprise Data Center. The SLE is divided into multiple releases: 1) MSE 1.0 - for the Regional Maintenance Centers and Ship Repair Facilities, including FDRMC Rota; 2) MSE 1.1 - for the Naval shipyards; 3) MSE 1.2 - which includes the eTWD capability; 4) MSE 1.3 - for addressing FISCAM requirements, adding an interface for SABRS, and for Database Optimization of the entire environment across the fleet maintenance enterprise to improve throughput for the user community."

Selected systems modernizations are aligned with ongoing systems sustainment to provide an IT solution until a Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) based Technical Refresh of this solution can be completed and deployed. Existing IT contracts will be used for sustainment services and new contracts will be put in place to support NMMES TR services, utilizing existing delivery orders where feasible. ePLM: NSWC-PHD will lead the integration of SBIR-developed technologies through the utilization of Phase 3 SBIR contracts. SBIR technologies will be enhanced and integrated into the ePLM tool suite and will result in execution of a competitive, full acquisition strategy."

                            "val": "The large increase in the FY18 profile stems from the decision to invest in programs that directly align with the Sailor 2025 vision for modernization of the personnel system and transition to ready, relevant learning. The most significant increase stems from NSIPS, which in FY18 will complete its acquisition processes and award its first task order for Pay Modernization (PayMod), and also includes an add in support of the DoD Force of the Future for a Navy Active Component (AC)\/Reserve Component (RC) Permeability Solution to; (1) extend the reach for soliciting candidates for Navy jobs, (2) streamline the internal processes and supporting technologies to ensure timely payment for personnel who transition between AC, RC, Government civilian or contractor jobs, and (3) improve the Navy's ability to support Component Commanders with rapid requirements posting and talent acquisition for emergent needs.  The remaining increase is due to the increase in LMS-DL transitioning the Collaborative Learning Environment Product from a limited prototype to full production capability.  \n\nBILLET BASED DISTRIBUTION (BBD)\n\nBBD increase in FY18 is a Sailor 2025 initiative aimed at modernizing distribution and order writing systems.  The effort begins functional work and follow-on development to collapse NROWS, NMCMPS, EAIS, and OAIS into a single distribution system.  \n\nThe objective of BBD is to increase personnel readiness, improve fit and provide clear visibility to the impact on mission readiness at the billet level. BBD will facilitate maximizing the contributions of every member of the Navy workforce by delivering competency-based career paths.\n\nLEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - DISTANCE LEARNING (LMS-DL)\n\nLMS-DL increase in FY18 is a Sailor 2025 initiative supporting ready relevant learning, with a focus to align Navy learning, create a career learning continuum, and leverage evolving technologies to expand learning solutions when and where the Sailor needs them.  The collaborative learning environment (CLE) is a key component within the learning IT strategy that leverages Commercial-Off-the-Shelf products to integrate the CLE with intelligent tutors, a multi-purpose reconfigurable training system (MRTS), electronic classrooms (ECR), trainers and labs, interactive multimedia instruction (IMI), instructors, and a virtual environment.  The increase in FY18 is to transition the pilot capability from FY17 into a production capability.  \n\nAs part of Sailor 2025 holistic IT approach, ready & relevant learning requires the development of a Learning Management System that permits:\n\n(1) Mobile & flexible delivery of modular training to the sailor\n(2) Synchronization of work requirements with learning modules to ensure proper training is delivered at the right time\n\nThis funding will develop and deploy new technologies for modularized training in fleet concentration areas to support the continuum of learning. This includes:\n\n(1) Development, modification or replacement of the current LMS platform\n(2) Integration of Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Education (MPTE) management tools to support end to end business processes (billet information, assignment, distribution, student management, learning management, personnel information, advancement) that will be impacted by changes to learning delivery and career profiles via Progressive Navy Enlisted Classifications (e.g. Total Force Manpower Management System, Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System, Learning Assessment System, Navy Training Management Planning System) .\n\nThe Learning Management tools and supporting IT infrastructure must also be modified to support management of training into the Delayed Entry Program, the growing use of demonstration videos, social media, student and learning management for MPTE mobility efforts, gaming and simulation technology as it is brought on-line.\n\nLMS-DL will also introduce the Learning Continuum Pilot, a risk reduction effort that develops proof of concept alignment of sailor training requirements with learning content delivery.\n\nMY NAVY PORTAL (MNP)\nMNP is building an integrated web portal that consolidates the Navy's Human Resource portals, knowledge, and applications into a single and simplified user experience.  Through the use of a multi-phased development approach, MNP will provide an intuitive self-service single point of entry for Sailors to view and manage their personnel and career information.   MNP provides Active and Reserve Sailors with personalized interactive experiences and allows access to relevant information including learning content, human resource applications, and career business processes.\n\nMNP Phase 2C continues to mature eleven Career Life Event (CLE) capabilities.  Phase 2C continues requirements refinement work with key Fleet stakeholders and integrates or develops the identified CLEs.\n\nMy Navy Portal may address previously deferred requirements from prior phases. Should MNP exceed schedule\/delivery, planned follow-on phases or activities may be accelerated.  \n\nANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE\/ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (AOA)\nThe Navy will conduct multiple AoAs to analyze viable alternatives in order to determine the most efficient and effective solution to address the modernization of elements of the Navy's Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPTE) IT portfolio.  AOA will assess operational effectiveness, suitability, and costs of non-tactical systems to meet emerging capability requirements.\n\nNAVY STANDARD INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS)\n\nNSIPS increase in FY18 is aligned with the Sailor 2025 initiative to modernize personnel systems.  The substantial increase is attributed to the planned start of the Pay Modernization (PayMod) program, and also includes an add in support of the DoD Force of the Future for a Navy AC\/RC Permeability Solution to; (1) extend the reach for soliciting candidates for Navy jobs, (2) streamline the internal processes and supporting technologies to ensure timely payment for personnel who transition between AC, RC, Government civilian or contractor jobs, and (3) improve the Navy's ability to support Component Commanders with rapid requirements posting and talent acquisition for emergent needs. \n\nNSIPS facilitates the Navy's portion of the largest Federal PeopleSoft Human Resources implementation, providing the Navy with a systematic modernization of our web-based pay and personnel system - both afloat and ashore.  NSIPS collects, validates, processes and transfers the data necessary to ensure accurate and timely pay and maintenance of personnel records.  \n\nPay Modernization (Pay Mod) will integrate the PeopleSoft Global Payroll solution with Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) to provide an integrated Personnel and Pay solution for the Navy.  Pay Mod will improve efficiency by eliminating current Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) workarounds, improve business intelligence by providing real-time access to pay data, and improve auditability by having authoritative data in an integrated personnel and pay capability.  Pay Mod is a solution to make more efficient use of military member time and funding for pay of active and reserve personnel.\n\nDetermining the retirement eligibility for Navy active duty service with both Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) time is complicated by the fact the computation has to be performed manually and requires consultation with numerous data sources.  Current solutions make it difficult to account for who is on active duty at any point in time and time-in-grade calculations for Selected Reserve (SELRES) personnel.  OPNAV N1 need the reports and data for budget execution as well as strength reporting to leadership and Congress.  Limitations in both payroll processes and systems induce a lapse between orders to effect change in status. SELRES personnel gained to Active Duty Special Work (ADSW) incur a delay in pay stemming from issues with loss\/gain timing in systems. SELRES personnel who re-enlist while on active duty orders are not retained when transitioning back to SELRES, and there is no retention of active duty Career History for Reserve personnel.  The Navy AC\/RC Permeability Solution will be included in the Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPTE) Transformation effort to leverage data in the authoritative data environment, modernize personnel and pay systems, and provide modern commercial solutions to; (1) extend the reach for soliciting candidates for Navy jobs, (2) streamline the internal processes and supporting technologies to ensure timely payment for personnel who transition between AC, RC, Government civilian or contractor jobs, and (3) improve the Navy's ability to support Component Commanders with rapid requirements posting and talent acquisition for emergent needs.\n\nNAVY MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS SYSTEM (NMRS)\n\nNMRS will modernize obsolete software and incorporate a wide array of enhancements (expanded capabilities based on sponsor's approved Functional Requirements Document) of new capabilities in support of Manpower Requirement efficiencies. Should NMRS deliver early, planned follow-on milestones may be accelerated.\n\nNMRS is a key tool which Navy manpower managers rely on to set, implement, and execute manpower requirements. Recommendations for improving data bases and the Navy's mobilization capacity rely on NMRS to make strength determinations.\n\nThe planned effort also includes technical evaluation and integration of products produced by the Simulation Toolset for Analysis of Mission, Personnel and Systems (STAMPS) program.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION (RMI)\nThe RMI program is a consolidation of DON risk management requirements into a single Program of Record (POR) to provide modern safety reporting and management capabilities for both active and reserve Navy and Marine Corps commands. RMI enables agile responses to business rule changes, automation of routine actions, improved data integrity, and facilitates self-service for organizations and individuals.\n\nRMI is being developed in three increments of capabilities: Streamlined Incident Reporting (SIR), Safety Program Management (SPM), and Analysis & Dissemination (A&D).  A fourth requirement, Single Point of Entry (SPOE), will be accomplished as part of the development of the three RMI increments since each will be built on the same Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) platform.  Each of these capabilities will be acquired as individual Abbreviated Acquisition Programs using an incremental development approach for reengineered business processes, while consolidating five legacy systems [Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS), Enterprise Safety Application Management Systems (ESAMS), Portsmouth Occupational Accident and Illness Reporting System (POAIRS), Medical Mishap and Compensation (MMAC), and Injury Tracker (INJTRK)]. \n\nAUTHORITATIVE DATA ENVIRONMENT (ADE)\n\nADE increase in FY18 is a Sailor 2025 initiative aimed at transitioning the current project based ADE into a full enterprise solution that is based on modern IT service models and cloud hosting technology.  This specific increase will advance data analytics and visualization capabilities, and add common platform services in a big data environment that is consistent with private industry.  This acceleration toward a true Navy-wide personnel authoritative data environment is a transformational increase in capability for decision support and improving personnel readiness.  \n\nAs part of the Sailor 2025 strategy, the Chief of Naval Personnel has directed an acceleration of expansion and development of the ADE and improvements in making MPTE data more available to commanders, sailors, business owners and MPTE and fleet executive leadership.  The ADE provides infrastructure, operations and sustainment of the Navy MPTE Authoritative Data Warehouse(ADW), enterprise service bus, and web support services. \n\nThe capabilities delivered by this funding includes the following:\n     (1) Completed \"golden record\" expansion increments\n          - Data quality\n          - Governance\n          - Security\n          - Data standardization\n     (2) Increased capabilities for MPTE supply chain & business operations\n          - Data discovery\n          - Advanced visualization tools\n          - Predictive analytics\n     (3) Enhanced architecture to support unstructured data and \"big data\" analytics\n     (4) Improved support for future identity management & access for mobile device capability\n\nAPPLICANT RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (ARM)\nARM provides automated support of the management of recruiting information. ARM enables all levels of recruiting to have real-time access to timely and accurate information. ARM provides managers with decision-making support by consolidating Navy Recruiting Command (NRC) legacy application systems. The complete ARM Systems Dev\/Mod effort will incorporate biometrics and paperless implementation across all lines of business systems to gain additional efficiencies. \n\nIncluded in the ARM program is the Self Service Accessions Application (SSAA). Phase II of this effort will build the SSAA application into the ARM system. SSAA is a mobile device-based software application. SSAA supports a change in the NRC business processes from a recruiter-driven business model to an applicant self-service business model. This \"app\" will be used by applicants to collaborate with recruiters anytime & anywhere to more efficiently and effectively navigate the recruiting process.\nFunding associated with Personnel TEMPO (PERSTEMPO) is being aligned to PE 060513N 2905 beginning in FY15.  This aligns the funds with the organization required to execute PERSTEMPO strategy as directed by the CNO to the CNP.  Two components are rolled together, modifying the ITEMPO system and further developing the Navy Deployment Health Location process.  This strategy consists of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) defined requirements (artifact is a Functional Requirements Document-FRD), modernization\/risk reduction of existing system (ITEMPO) and a process that uses our corporate systems at DMDC Mechanicsburg. \n\nThe desired effects of PERSTEMPO strategy are:\n- Generate efficiencies throughout the Fleet to meet statutory requirements and improve Fleet readiness.\n- Provide improved service to Sailors (improving retention).\n- Facilitate informed management decision making.\n\nAssociated sub-projects:\n\nIndividual TEMPO (ITEMPO): PERSTEMPO was implemented to comply with Sections 586 and 923 of the FY00 NDAA, now within 10 USCS 991.  This is a non-acquisition category program.  Each military service is to track and manage the number of deployed days and number of temporary duty days away from homeport for active and reserve personnel.  Information is reported to DoD\/DMDC, which is used to report to the Secretary of Defense.  ITEMPO is the system used to comply with these directives.  PERSTEMPO supports Navy management of stress on the force as requested by the CNO; Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (N1); and the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet (N1).  Enhancements will be performed on the primitive ITEMPO functional tools\/metrics to make it actionable, current in technology, user friendly, and integrated into a variety of personnel and pay systems.  Preparations are already underway to complete the FRD and perform a gap analysis within existing resources.  This will support pay auditability\/certainty when payment is authorized.  \n\nDEPLOYMENT HEALTH LOCATION:  Deployment Health Location is being implemented per DoD Instruction 6490.03, \"Deployment Health,\" (DoD Instruction) August 11, 2006.  This requires the Military Departments to plan, program, and implement a system to ensure daily location recording for all deployed personnel assigned, attached on temporary duty, or temporary additional duty to deployed units.  The Services are required to report the daily location information electronically to DMDC at least weekly.  Also, this will correct the finding by DoD Inspector General Report NO. DODIG 2012-112 of Jul 18, 2012.  \n\nCapability change for ITEMPO:  The system has had no significant software change in more than 8 years.  The report mechanisms are extremely antiquated.  \n\nCapability change Deployment Health Location:  Deployed Service members are potentially subject to occupational and environmental hazards that can include exposure to harmful levels of environmental contaminants, such as industrial toxic chemicals, chemical and biological warfare agents, or radiological and nuclear contaminants.  These hazards may include contamination from the past use of a site, battle damage, stored stockpiles, military use of hazardous materials, or from other sources.  Harmful levels include high-level exposures that result in immediate health effects and low-level exposures that could result in delayed or long-term health effects.  Collecting deployment information will allow the Military Health System to identify populations at risk for occupational and environmental exposures that may need medical follow-up.  Improving timeliness of treatment will have a positive effect on readiness and long-term wounded warrior care."

This strategy consists of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) defined requirements, modernization\/risk reduction of existing system (ITEMPO) and a process that uses our corporate systems at DMDC Mechanicsburg.\n\nITEMPO: PERSTEMPO was implemented to comply with Sections 586 and 923 of the FY00 NDAA, now within 10 USCS 991.  This is a non-acquisition category program.  Each military service is to track and manage the number of deployed days and number of temporary duty days away from homeport for active and reserve personnel.  This information is reported to DoD\/DMDC, which is used to report to the Secretary of Defense.  ITEMPO is the system used to comply with these directives.  PERSTEMPO supports Navy management of stress on the force as requested by the CNO; Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (N1); and the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet (N1).  Enhancements will be performed on the primitive ITEMPO functional tools\/metrics to make it actionable, current in technology, user friendly, and integrated into a variety of personnel and pay systems.  Preparations are already underway to complete the FRD and perform a gap analysis within existing resources.  This will support pay auditability\/certainty when payment is authorized.\n\nDEPLOYMENT HEALTH LOCATION: Deployment Health Location is being implemented per DoD Instruction 6490.03, \"Deployment Health,\" (DoD Instruction) August 11, 2006.  This requires the Military Departments to plan, program, and implement a system to ensure daily location recording for all deployed personnel assigned, attached, on temporary duty, or temporary additional duty to deployed units.  The Services are required to report the daily location information electronically to DMDC at least on a weekly basis.  Also, this will correct the finding by DoD Inspector General Report NO. DODIG 2012-112 of Jul 18, 2012."

JTDI is a digital technical data access, delivery and local Organizational & Intermediate level library management toolset and telemaintenance collaboration process enabler.  It improves accuracy and timeliness of technical manual and other technical data delivery and minimizes the Fleet's library management burden.  JTDI reduces maintenance work hours with a savings Return on Investment of 2.5:1.  It facilitates the transition of the Joint Distance Support and Response Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration for telemaintenance and provides for process efficiencies to support ongoing Aviation Fleet Technical Representative reductions.\n\nMarine Aviation Logistics Enterprise Information Technology (MAL-EIT) - MAL-EIT funding supports the evaluation, development, testing and integration of software and hardware solutions across all US Marine Corps Aviation activities to be used in the planning and execution of geographically distributed, expeditionary Aviation Logistics (AVLOG) chains in support of deployed USMC Air Combat Element operations.  The MAL-EIT Program is one of four programs contained within the Marine Aviation Logistics Support Program (MALSP) modernization program known as MALSP II.  Legacy MALSP is nearly 25 years old and grossly inadequate in IT capability to meet the informational, planning, and C2 needs of a dynamic, geographically distributed nodal AVLOG system. MAL-EIT is a Defense Business System Abbreviated Acquisition Program that will develop and deliver the required IT capability necessary to eliminate the IT related gaps existing in the legacy MALSP.  MAL-EIT is a family of IT solutions to be developed and delivered in three increments.  These increments are depicted below:\n\nExpeditionary Pack Up Kit (EPUK): Provides Expeditionary Supply Operations to include business administration, inventory, and customer service operations.\n\nNext Generation Buffer Management System: Provides buffer management in a time domain, and buffer sizing analysis.\n\nLogistics Planning Tool and Optimizer Tool: Provides capability to develop tailored Remote Expeditionary Support Packages, consumption forecasts, and Nodal Logistics Lay down designs."

                            "val": "Aviation Data Warehouse\/NAVAIR Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation (DECKPLATE) - The development of the DECKPLATE program is the next generation data warehouse for aircraft maintenance, flight, and usage data. It provides a web-based interface to a single source of information currently being stored in multiple Naval Aviation Logistics Data Analysis systems.  Through the use of analysis, query, and reporting tools the user has the capabilities to effectively obtain readiness data in a near real-time environment, as well as providing historical data for long range planning, trend analysis and records analysis, records reconstruction, and compliance with technical directives.  DECKPLATE supports the mission of the warfighter who requires a single source of near real-time aviation data in which to base critical readiness decisions. This requires collecting data from authoritative sources into a data warehouse.  Because the warfighter only needs to access one database, the time consuming task of collecting various pieces of data from various sources will be reduced and ultimately eliminated.  This improves data quality because it reduces the possibility of two systems providing identical data elements, but slightly different data. Data availability is improved through continuous near real-time feeds from the data sources, giving the warfighter the most current information to base decisions.  In addition, this also accomplishes a reduction in legacy systems mandated by Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. DECKPLATE manages total inventory for two major categories of assets, Aircraft and Engine\/Propulsion Systems\/Modules (EPSMs).DECKPLATE is comprised of the Aircraft Inventory and Readiness Reporting (DECK-AIRRS) and the Engine Transaction Reporting (DECK-ETR) subsystems which provide the complete lifecycle for aircraft and Engine\/ Propulsion System\/Modules (EPSMs). Both DECK-ETR and DECK-AIRRS are undergoing a FISCAM assessment (FY16) and audit (FY17) and are undergoing review for designation as the Accountable Property System of Record (APSR) for aircraft and uninstalled engines.\n\nCondition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) - Funding supports the automated analysis and decision making processes, for the CBM+ Initiative which provides Naval Aviation Enterprise with common enabling capabilities which deliver timely data-driven decisional information to optimize aircraft availability and materiel readiness by incorporating health and usage leading indicators into the failure mode mitigation process, enabling the Warfighter to more efficiently meet mission requirements. The CBM+ Initiative increases readiness by streamlining maintenance processes, provide the sustainment base with timely, actionable logistics data not previously available, and enable engineers and acquisition professionals to support system improvements based on CBM+ acquired data results. CBM+ provides the enabling solutions needed to extend the life of current and new acquisition aircraft, realizing savings from reductions in field (organizational and intermediate) maintenance actions, reduced functional check flight hours, mishap mitigation, and reduced parts usage.  \n\nIntegrated Logistics Support Management System (ILSMS) - This is a new start program. Funding supports the development of the ILSMS program is the next generation analytical tool set for Unit, Aircraft, Engines, Component Readiness and Cost metrics.  It will be a web-based tool that will provide the user with validated and aggregated data.  ILSMS provides analysts with the means to pull data on type\/model\/series (TMS) readiness, run detailed component analysis, manage aircraft life by bureau number, request lists of TMSs' top degraders, model the impacts of degraded components on readiness and cost, generate production scenarios, and manage the incorporation of technical directives. ILSMS institutionalizes a data analysis process that is repeatable and establishes a common understanding of readiness and cost degraders among its users.  This is also the foundation for working with provider organizations to establish metrics, actionable mitigation plans and milestones. Integrated Logistics Support Management System (ILSMS) will give its users a one stop shop to proactively identify readiness and cost degraders quickly with a consistent methodology across all TMS thus providing a standardized tool to assist programs in reducing total ownership costs."

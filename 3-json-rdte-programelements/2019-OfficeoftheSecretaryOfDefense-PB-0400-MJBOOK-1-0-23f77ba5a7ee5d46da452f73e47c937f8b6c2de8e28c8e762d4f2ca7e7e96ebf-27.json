            "val": "Department and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoD\u2019s overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The Department has also undergone an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives)."

This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department\u2019s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades - a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. Better Buying Power (BBP) is the implementation of best practices to strengthen the Defense Department's buying power, improve industry productivity, and provide an affordable, value-added military capability to the Warfighter.  Launched in 2010, BBP encompasses a set of fundamental acquisition principles to achieve greater efficiencies through affordability, cost control, elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy, and promotion of competition. BBP initiatives also incentivize productivity and innovation in industry and Government, and improve tradecraft in the acquisition of services. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.  To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and advance BBP initiatives to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives."

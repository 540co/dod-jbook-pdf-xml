In FY 2020, this realignment includes a transfer of funding and appropriate project investment areas from the Quick Reaction Fund to PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development.  The remaining QRSP funding is focused on prototyping projects that are executed faster and explore higher risk concepts with the potential for immediate impacts to the Combatant Commanders and joint warfighters.  Additionally, in FY 2020 the Joint Raid Acquisition Cell Support will be transferred to PE 0903399D8Z within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment for alignment and execution.  \n\nFunding in the QRSP PE enables leadership within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)) to anticipate and quickly respond to emergent Combatant Command (CCMD) issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution and incubating them to rapidly develop potentially game-changing capabilities.  QRSP harnesses the national industrial bases by partnering with military Services, interagency partners, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), academia, and traditional or non-traditional industry."

            "val": "The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element funds the development of risk-reducing prototypes and accelerates capability innovation to deliver performance to the joint warfighter at the speed of relevance.  QRSP prototypes increase warfighter lethality, affordably counter emerging technological threats, and help address the immediate needs of the Combatant Commands (CCMD).  Due to the relatively low average cost of projects, QRSP is able to explore higher-risk opportunities with potentially higher reward.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman\u2019s Capability Gap Assessment, DoD\u2019s modernization priorities, and the Combatant Commands\u2019 (CCMD) Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).\n\nThe QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA).  Efforts within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, address challenges identified in the National Defense Strategy, and support the DoD\u2019s modernization priorities. \n\nThe QRF develops prototypes in response to emergent needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies and accelerate these innovations to the warfighter.  The QRF program initiates prototyping projects during the execution year to mature technologies critically needed for the CCMDs and rapidly transition those capabilities.  QRF projects are identified through current warfighter gaps, solutions proposed by CCMDs, and jointly applicable capabilities identified by the Services and Defense Agencies.  In 2020, QRF funding to support prototyping or experimentation will be transferred to PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development.  \n \nThe RRF develops prototypes to counter emerging threats; anticipate adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies; and, expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives accelerate innovation by rapidly developing high-risk prototypes with the potential for immediate and impactful transition of warfighter capabilities.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as machine learning algorithms and software intelligence, to enable novel prototypes with agile technology insertion paths.  Funded projects also leverage existing capabilities from traditional industrial bases and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses.      \n\nThe JRAC responds, in timeframes acceptable to the CCMDs, to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEON) that are submitted by CCMDs and validated by the Joint Staff.  To meet these objectives, JRAC leverages contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.  In 2020, the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell Support will transfer to PE 0903399D8Z.  \n\nThe SMA supports senior leadership within the CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the U.S. government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems to inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations (DDGO).  SMA products are typically generated within six to nine months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD senior leadership."

New capabilities address National Defense Strategy priorities and inform programs of record or new acquisition pathways to more effectively and affordably push innovation to the field.  QRF focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, and asymmetric warfare needs.  QRF initiatives typically deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.\n\nIn FY 2019, QRF identifies and funds prototypes that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  QRF projects are selected in the year of execution based on Department, CCMD, Service, and other government organization identified threats and opportunities.  In FY 2020, QRF funds will transfer to PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development to facilitate prototyping and experimentation to support the DoD\u2019s modernization priorities.\n \nRecent success stories and significant transitions of note include:\n\u2022 Talon Archer:  This project prototyped novel sensors capable of passively detecting nation-state assets at extended ranges.  The project demonstrated these novel sensors at key locations to provide indications and warnings in defense of the homeland.  The information from the Talon Archer sensors will be sent to national organizations in near-real time to inform decision makers.  Talon Archer transitioned to support a classified mission in the U.S. Northern Command area of responsibility.  Additional details are classified.\n\u2022 Isosceles: This project prototyped an on-demand experimentation capability that provides high-fidelity results for understanding whether certain strategic systems meet their performance thresholds and goals.  Isosceles removes the need to use dissimilar surrogates during system evaluations, significantly improving the quality and accuracy of the evaluations.  Isosceles transitioned to a classified program of record in 2018.   \n\u2022 Sidecast:  This project deployed a prototype set of fully customizable government-off-the-shelf tools for network exploitation.  The solution leverages government best practices and expands DoD\u2019s capability to operate with customized software tools.  Sidecast enhances the Combatant Commands\u2019 capability to operate and exploit network information in near real time.  With this capability, the warfighter has tools designed for open network exploitation for a fraction of the cost of existing programs.  Sidecast transitioned to a classified customer within the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.\n\u2022 Hammerhead:  This project responded to the need for more available courses of action in the event of certain space systems contingencies.  The OSD project team and the Space Systems Defense Program (SSDP) transitioned Hammerhead to an operational capability.  Additional details are classified."

RRF anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including current and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responds to new threats and opportunities.  Project selection is guided by department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy and the DoD\u2019s modernization areas.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and deliver affordable capabilities faster than standard acquisition cycles.  These lower-cost prototypes and innovative business processes give the USD(R&E) the agility to quickly explore new, higher-risk technology areas that have the potential for immediate, game-changing impacts.\n\nIn prior years, RRF supported the creation of novel sensing systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; produced advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing innovative technologies.   \n\nIn FY 2019 and FY 2020, RRF will continue to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and provide a hedge against technology risk by identifying and delivering near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.  Focus areas for RRF include: disparate data fusion; autonomous systems and behaviors; urban characterization for enhanced lethality; prototypes for interconnected sensors and command networks; novel manufacturing to rapidly field prototypes; and, novel applications of repurposed commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf technologies. \n\nRecent success stories and significant transitions of note include:\n\u2022 High Accuracy Video Object Classification (HAVOC): A prototype system that provided an automated, machine learning enabled, target recognition capability for expeditionary forces using a desktop computer.  HAVOC transitioned to an intelligence community partner in 2018, and HAVOC technologies have been incorporated into Project Maven.  \n\u2022 Wide-area Infrared System for 360-Degree Persistent (WISP) surveillance: WISP prototyped and implemented a long-wave infrared hemispherical sensor for surveillance and tracking of moving objects.  This effort supports the counter-unmanned aerial systems mission by expanding the sensor\u2019s field of view to 90 degrees elevation and refining the detection algorithms for the new targets.  WISP transitioned to the U.S. Air Force.  \n\u2022 Future Infrared Search and Track (FIRST): FIRST created a novel method of building optical sensors capable of staring over a wide field of view with high resolution.  The advantages of this method include producing an image with more pixels than the focal plane array, decoupling the field of view from the aspect ratio of the focal plane, and extending the field of view beyond the optical design.  The FIRST prototype transitioned to the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research for follow-on testing, development, and deployment.\n\u2022 Social Network Aided Geolocation (SNAG): SNAG prototyped a suite of automated machine learning algorithms that accurately estimate geolocations for social media messages from location-indicative terms and metadata features.  This capability provides location estimates for the large volume of social media content that is not explicitly geotagged.  Geospatial analysis of social media has proven effective for identifying and tracking actors of interest as well as understanding local concerns and sentiments within an area of interest.  SNAG transitioned to the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s GOSSIP architecture, which is widely used across the intelligence community."

At the request of AFSPC, the FY 2017 and FY 2018 Gray Zone efforts focused on contested space operations.  Among other issues, this effort addressed the implications (rewards and risks) of the U.S. adopting a policy of space as a joint, combined, and inter-agency warfighting domain.  At the request of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) and U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC), FY 2018 funding also initiated an assessment of plausible political-military options regarding North Korea and near- and long-term implications of these for the U.S. and regional stakeholders.  These two follow-on Gray Zone efforts will apply the concepts and insights derived during the first phase to the realm of contested space operations in support of AFSPC, and implications of various U.S. actions towards North Korea.

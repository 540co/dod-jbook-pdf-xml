            "val": "This Program Element (PE) conducts fundamental research relevant to the Soldier focused on new materials, properties and phenomena in four research areas: (1) lightweight materials and hybrid assemblies for enhanced expeditionary operations, (2) materials and mechanisms that mitigate effects from blast and ballistic threats, (3) materials for augmented soldier protection and situational awareness, and (4) multifunctional materials with integrated structure, power storage, communications, sensing,and\/or propulsion to provide system level efficiencies. This project funds collaborative applied research and integration of government, academic, and industry scientific research to advance innovative capabilities.  \n\nThis PE sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Soldier portfolio. \n\nWork in this PE builds on the materials research transitioned from PE 0601102A and 0601104A. This work complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM)."

Research conducted enables new manufacturing capabilities through the development of high performance feedstock materials (polymers, metals, ceramics), physics-based process models, and in situ process monitoring that can be integrated with process models to enable real-time control and manipulation of materials structure and properties.  The goal of this work is to develop robust predictive model and simulation tools linking manufacturing processes with materials structure, properties, and performance to accelerate the rate of innovative material adaptations (protection, power, sensing, signature management) necessary to rapidly respond to emerging and unknown threats in a battlefield environment.\n\nThis Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, and Soldier portfolios.  \n\nWork in this Project makes extensive use of high performance computing and experimental validation and builds on research transitioned from Program Element (PE) 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences), Project H42 (Materials and Mechanics), and Project H43 (Ballistics).  The work complements and is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Survivability and Lethality Technologies), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology), and PE 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technologies with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.  Increasing the lethality, range, and performance of munitions, while striving to increase the safety for our warfighters for munitions in procurement and under development guide program investments.  \n\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEO for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Board (TAB) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) technology experts and laboratory representatives plus senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting."

The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts \u2013 providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.\n\nThis effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1 and 5000.02.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the Program Executive Office (PEO) IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.  Technologies demonstrated seek to improve the performance, lethality, and range of weapons to ensure the U.S. is not outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.  \n\nThe Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs."

These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; reduced smoke or smoky propellants, including formulation, characterization and scale-up; rocket motor case design; materials for active and passive thermal mitigation; shock mitigation materials and techniques; passive and active coatings; active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers; ignition systems; sensors; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsions systems due to Fragment and Bullet Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of High Performance Propulsion rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large High Performance Propulsion motors.  Additional goal is to improve range to 2 times our current capabilities, with improvements in the IM responses."

The development and demonstration of minimum signature (MS) rocket technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, MS rocket propellant formulations; ingredients for MS propellant formulations, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; case and packaging design; active and passive venting techniques; rocket motor case design; ignition systems; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Of particular interest are technologies toward higher burning rate MS propellants with state-of-the-art energy and reduced shock sensitivity.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the MSP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment Impact, Slow Cook Off, and Shaped Charge Jet (SCJ) threats, as well as improving range to 1.5 times our current capabilities in the near term and 2 times our current capabilities in the out years, with improvements in the IM responses."

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition Insensitive Munitions (IM) response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact and Slow and Fast Cook threats, with a focus on high performance gun propulsion systems designed for extended range and increased lethality in 2028 and 2033."

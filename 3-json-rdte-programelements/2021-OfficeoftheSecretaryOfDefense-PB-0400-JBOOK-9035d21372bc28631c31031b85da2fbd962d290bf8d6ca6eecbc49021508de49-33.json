Aligned with the National Defense Strategy, this program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future, building a more lethal force.  To meet this objective, the T&E\/S&T Program performs the following activities:\n\u2022 Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&E) requirements.\n\u2022 Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&E community.\n\u2022 Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&E.\nAdditionally, the T&E\/S&T Program examines emerging T&E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&E technology needs and develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other Government agencies, and industry to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  The program outreaches and engages academia to address test technology challenges in DoD testing, advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and other minority serving institutions.  This program provides travel funds for T&E\/S&T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  The T&E\/S&T Program aligns with the science and technology (S&T) Communities of Interest (COI) to prepare the T&E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from priority S&T investments.  The T&E\/S&T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities."

Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the S&T community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced T&E technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.\nThe HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today\u2019s T&E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&S) fidelity, and range safety.\nThe HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&E."

The HSST project continued progress toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by a previous HSST test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine\u2019s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  In addition to the ability to test in clean air, a variable Mach number capability is required to \u201cfly the mission\u201d and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&E\/S&T program, were integrated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, and variable Mach number aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aerothermal and Propulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that the component technologies and their integration have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  The Regenerative Storage Heater (RSH), was demonstrated at flight representative temperatures, allowing non-vitiated air up to Mach 7.5 conditions to be supplied.  Final design, fabrication, and installation of the air delivery system (ADS) was completed, which will permit uniform flow into the test cabin with variable pressure and temperature from multiple sources, including the RSH.  The facility initiated checkout runs to validate its operation to support DoD weapon systems.\nThe design for a free-jet, variable Mach nozzle (VMN) for use in HAPCAT was continued.  Such a capability will permit much more accurate simulation of transient operations along a flight trajectory in a free-jet configuration.  The design of the VMN will also serve as a risk-reduction effort for a larger-scale VMN for use in the future full-scale facility.\n  Efforts continued on the installation of a variable Mach number direct-connect nozzle for hypersonic ground test facilities that will provide flight-equivalent Mach numbers between 4 and 6 at true temperatures.  The nozzle utilizes a metallic flexible wall to vary the Mach number while withstanding the high temperatures.  It will be integrated into the HAPCAT facility upon completion for checkout.\n  The development of a high-pressure tunable-diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) continued for eventual integration into HAPCAT to provide accurate air temperature measurements at high temperatures and pressures, which will be used for facility control and determination of facility conditions. The TDLAS system will have uses in other facilities as well for temperature measurements.\n  The arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development progressed toward independently-powered spin-coils to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces within the arc heater.  The effort investigated two different spin-coil designs, one of which was validated for use in the mid-pressure arc heater facility.  This effort will improve the service life of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  \n  The HSST project continued research that will provide better prediction and determination of boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance.  Understanding and predicting boundary layer transition represents a critical shortfall in the hypersonic community, as it affects the thermal loads, stability and control, and overall performance of a vehicle.  Test data from a seven degree cone model were evaluated to assess test techniques and boundary layer transition measurement capabilities between various facilities.  Analysis of tests of a boost-glide vehicle were completed in a quiet wind tunnel environment and a traditional, \u201cnoisy\u201d wind tunnel environment, providing insight into the effects of flow field disturbances on boundary layer transition continued.\n  Facility flow field characterizations were conducted at the Purdue quiet tunnel and the Large Energy National Shock (LENS) facilities at Calspan University at Buffalo Research Center (CUBRC), enabling more effective comparisons between all the facilities and informing test customers of intrinsic flow features in each facility.  The characterizations will also provide insight to boundary layer transition studies in these facilities.  The HSST project also conducted testing of a boost-glide vehicle, resulting in critical findings to support future flight tests of the vehicle.   \n  \n  The HSST project continued the design and development of a SkyRange capability to support hypersonic flight testing.  This capability aims to provide a more agile, flexible, and cost-effective method for providing support to hypersonic flight tests in the areas of telemetry, atmospheric sensing, optical imaging, flight safety, and other fields to aid in the development of hypersonic vehicles.  The capability will reduce the requirement and high-costs of the \u201cstring of pearls\u201d collection of air, sea, and land resources used for hypersonic flight tests.  Several different technologies within the HSST project will be integrated as part of the SkyRange.  \n  Development of an airborne version of the already completed ground LIDAR system continued with the design and testing of hardware components for the in-flight demonstration of the system in preparation for implementation on an un-crewed vehicle.  Design for integration of the system on-board an unmanned Global Hawk also continued.\n  Progress continued on a high fidelity automated airborne reconfigurable tracking system which seeks to provide high resolution imaging of hypersonic vehicles in flight.  The final design was completed including concepts for integration onto a Global Hawk aircraft.  Design for integration of the system on-board an unmanned Global Hawk also continued.  This technology will be integrated as part of a SkyRange capability as well.\n  The development and improvement of a telemetry capability integrated with a High Altitude, Long Endurance Un-crewed Aerial System (HALE UAS) for a technical demonstration continued.  An iterative development process is ongoing and the latest version of the system was integrated onto a Global Hawk and ground tested. In preparation for long range flight tests, multiple Range Hawks were deployed to Hawaii to exercise CONOPS for multi-aircraft mission support."

A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&E operations.\n  The L- and S- Band frequencies are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including the potential for a large increase in available bandwidth, but the C-Band spectrum comes with technical challenges and regulatory constraints.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band and the band is heavily shared for alternate uses.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size, weight and power) nor ruggedized packaging to survive airborne test applications.\n  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test range infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry and cellular based telemetry capabilities enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  The DoD strategy is to create technologies for implementing a telemetry capability in C-Band, using the legacy L- and S-Bands for both streaming and networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.\n  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked and cellular based telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges."

The ruggedized switch provides the Ethernet backbone on the aircraft which supports the transport of packetized telemetry data from the onboard instrumentation systems to the telemetry transceiver which transmits the data to the control room.\n  The SET project successfully demonstrated a software tool capable of accurately estimating current and future spectrum needs. The tool accounted for actual versus scheduled utilization of the spectrum and quantified the cost and schedule implications of the loss of needed spectrum. The spectrum efficient metrics tool provides spectrum managers a planning tool and also provides justification data needed to retain spectrum. The SET project also developed an optimized frequency planning tool supporting frequency re-use planning algorithms for telemetry networks and legacy telemetry systems. This planning tool provides next generation spectrum planning tools allowing for dynamic frequency re-allocation.\n  The SET project completed risk reduction on a networked data recorder and data transmission scheme in support of CTEIP networked telemetry projects.  The networked data recorder addressed CTEIP requirements for data recording and parametric extraction during flight testing.  The networked data recorder was used as the primary data recorder during CTEIP flight tests.  The data transmission scheme is designed to minimize the amount and type of data transmitted over the telemetry network, reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed during a test event.

Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. \n  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicator (HFI) systems, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.\n  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.\n  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds."

Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.\n  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) communities of interest (COIs).  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced time, space, position information (TSPI) instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.   The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power from instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during operational test (OT) and continuous assessment throughout a system\u2019s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders."

                            "val": "The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.\n  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats."

Investments in test execution will include:  enhancing safety of autonomous system testing; creating test environments that are complex, immersive, and reactive; and adapting ranges to cognitive, autonomous system testing.  Developments under performance assessment will include: testing and evaluating UAS-to-UAS and human-to-UAS interactions and measuring autonomous system reliability.\n  The AAIT project will investigate new technologies specifically for creating faster-than-real-time versions of autonomies.  Developing this technology will allow multiple copies of a black-box autonomy to be run in modeled environments to gather statistically significant information regarding the performance boundaries of an autonomy.\n  The AAIT project will complete development of technologies that automatically learn conditions for activating vulnerabilities deep within an autonomous system, using machine learning and backward chaining techniques to determine system level inputs that induce failure."

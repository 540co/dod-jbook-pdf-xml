            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary advances in turbine, advanced cycle, rocket, and space propulsion as well as electrical power, thermal management and fuels. The program has six projects, each focusing on technologies with a high potential to enhance the performance of existing and future Air Force weapons systems. The Aerospace Fuels project develops and demonstrates improved hydrocarbon fuels and advanced propulsion systems, including those for air-breathing high-speed\/hypersonic flight. The Aerospace Power Technology project develops and demonstrates adaptive power and thermal management components, controls, and systems for high-power payloads and aircraft as part of energy-optimized aircraft development. The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project integrates the engine cores demonstrated in the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project with low-pressure components into demonstrator engines. The Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion project develops and demonstrates innovative rocket propulsion technologies, propellants, and manufacturing techniques. The Advanced Aerospace Propulsion project develops the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for in-flight demonstration and for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket based). The Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project develops and demonstrates core turbine engine technologies for current and future aircraft propulsion systems. Portions of the Aerospace Fuels, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, and Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration projects support adaptive cycle technology demonstrations, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

The advanced fuel emphasis is on demonstrating new thermally stable, high-heat sink, and controlled chemically reacting fuels for a conventional turbine engine, turbine-based combined cycle engines, and other advanced propulsion systems. The project also evaluates and demonstrates fuel system components that minimize cost, reduce maintenance, and improve performance of future aerospace systems. The advanced propulsion emphasis is on demonstrating concepts for combined cycle, ramjet, and scramjet engines. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies. This project develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs."

The Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high- pressure spool) technology developed under the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator (ATEGG) project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine-to-airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystems technologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The APSI project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with ten times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, high power extraction, integrated thermal management, and durability for widely varying mission needs."

The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon- fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7. Efforts include: scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers; active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition); robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions; and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight."

The objective is to provide continuous evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and\/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components such as; inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, exhaust systems, and system level technologies such as; integrated power generators and thermal management systems on core engine performance, and durability in ground demonstrations of engine cores. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the APSI Project of this program. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs."

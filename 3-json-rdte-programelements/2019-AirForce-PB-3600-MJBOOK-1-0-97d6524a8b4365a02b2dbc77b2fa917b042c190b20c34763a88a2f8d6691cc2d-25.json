The MPE program enables the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD) to execute its assigned missions with mission partners across the complete ranges and phases of military operations to assist combined command and control (C2) of coalition forces while meeting the information sharing requirements within existing bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements. Also, it promotes effective information exchange and provides applications to enable effective use of the United States and Partner nation military power. MPE provides the warfighter mission with technology to improve mission effectiveness and cyber security.\n\nIn response to program decision memorandum, funding for Mission Partner Environment transferred the capabilities the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) program, the All Partners Access Network (APAN), and the Combined Federal Battle Labs Network (CBFLNet) to the Mission Partner Environment Program. MPE enables secure sharing of operational information and enhances collaboration between the US forces, and trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners. FY2019 funding procures hardware and software to support the consolidation of a common mission network capability that supports operations with the Mission Partners environment.\n\nThis funding will deliver procedures, workstations, switches, servers, cross-domain solutions, communications infrastructure, video teleconference suites, network equipment, storage and backup, encryption equipment, software licenses, infrastructure, deployable suites and software communications. Variations in quantity and unit price reflect planned capital investment.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

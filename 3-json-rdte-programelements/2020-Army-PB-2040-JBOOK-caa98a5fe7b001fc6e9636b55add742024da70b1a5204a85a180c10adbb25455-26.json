The technologies being investigated are for both mounted and dismounted applications. Project H24 (Countermine Technology) investigates state of the art counter explosive hazard technologies to accurately detect and neutralize threats with a high probability, reduce false alarms, and enable an increased operational tempo. Project H35 (Camouflage and Counter-Recon Tech) designs and develops advanced sensor protection, signature management, and deception techniques for masking friendly force capabilities and intentions. \n\nWork in this PE is related to and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

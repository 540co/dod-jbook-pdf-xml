Funds are necessary to update current government-owned software to ingest and disseminate new data sources from Title 10 and Title 50 sensors.  The DIFC efforts at COCOM sponsored experimentation events will inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations.\n\nThe USSTRATCOM Defense Critical Infrastructure Protection program (DCIP) is a risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to USSTRATCOM and other DoD missions.  Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links. DCIP is directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense & Americas' Security Affairs) [OASD (HD&ASA)].  DCIP manages the identification, prioritization, assessment, and assurance of Critical Infrastructure as a comprehensive program that includes the development of adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk, restore capability in the event of loss or degradation, support incident management, and protect defense critical infrastructure.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

MODORD to OPERATION OLYMPIC DEFENDER calls for the execution of GPS-contested environments as part of the Joint Combat Capability in Contested Environment Assessments (JC3EA).  FORTUNE POFAs are PNT capability and vulnerability assessments associated with a Service exercise or mission event.  PRISM POFAs encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific CCMD and\/or service exercises or mission events.  Assessments inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations in the anticipated theater Navwar threat environments.

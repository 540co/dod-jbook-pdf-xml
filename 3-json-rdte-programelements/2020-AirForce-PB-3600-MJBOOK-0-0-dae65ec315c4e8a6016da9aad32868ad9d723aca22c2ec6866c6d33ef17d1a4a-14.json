This program is part of an overall Department of Defense Directed Energy Science and Technology program. Directed Energy weapon systems have many potential advantages including speed of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements. Directed Energy Weapon Systems have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including high value asset and base protection, precision strike and platform self-protection versus a wide variety of missile, rocket, artillery, mortar and air platforms. Efforts under this program are generally chosen for their potential to have an impact on multiple Directed Energy Weapon systems and multiple Service missions while complementing Service\/Agency efforts that are directed at specific Service needs. A broad range of technologies are addressed in key areas such as laser sources, microwave sources, laser beam control, antennas, waveguides, modeling and simulation, and lethality mechanisms. This program supports the Senior Official as required. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

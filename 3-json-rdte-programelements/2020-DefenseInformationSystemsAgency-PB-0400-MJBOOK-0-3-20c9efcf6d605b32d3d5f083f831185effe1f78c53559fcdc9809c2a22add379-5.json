The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&E) activities, are to validate that DISA\u2019s (and the Department\u2019s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and\/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA\u2019s T&E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA\u2019s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. \n\nAs the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: \n  \u2022  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.\n  \u2022  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service\/Agency Tactical Data systems.\n  \u2022  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. \n  \u2022  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.\n  \u2022  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD\u2019s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT\/NSS). \n  \u2022  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service\/Agency Tactical systems.\n\nJITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: \n  \u2022  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  \n  \u2022  Conducting assessments during one of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).\n  \u2022  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. \n  \u2022  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. \n  \u2022  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).\n  \u2022  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. \n  \u2022  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. \n \nAs the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT\/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.\n\nJITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) events to determine if IT\/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  \n\nJITC focuses its efforts towards core T&E improvements, better T&E policy for IT\/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.\n\nThe T&E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA\u2019s MRTFB each year are to:  \n  \u2022  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.\n  \u2022  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. \n  \u2022  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&E on changing or emerging technologies. \n  \u2022  Provide T&E guidance\/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices."

The F-22 is a multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines low observability, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable air superiority aircraft. The program is continuing planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities. The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, navigations, pilot systems, and electronic warfare.\n\nThe F-22 Raptor's modernization development is conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as agile and lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor enterprise to develop, test, and field software\/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-22 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Labs provide maintenance, staffing, and operation of 16 development labs including four unique major System Integration Laboratories (SILs): Agile Integration Lab (AIL) with the Flying Test Bed (FTB),  Ogden Test Enterprise (OTE) Lab, Air Combat Simulation (ACS) Lab, and the Vehicle System Simulator (VSS) Lab. The F-22 Combined Test Force (CTF) located at Edwards Air Force Base conducts full-up weapons system testing to assess the effect of the F-22 combined characteristics of stealth, speed, maneuverability, and integrated avionics upon mission accomplishment. The CTF uses operationally significant ground and flight test scenarios to identify system performance deficiencies early before they are more difficult and costly to resolve. \n\nF-22 Small Projects provides technology studies and demonstrations to include, but not limited to, Low Observable (LO) signature management, threat modeling support, Developmental Test (DT) weapon assets, Pilot Training (PT), dynamic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), cyber security, flight test engine refurbishment, support equipment development, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and Electronic Warfare (EW) system enhancements to counter evolving threats. \n\nOperational Software Development utilizes commercially available agile and lean best practices to transform and accelerate the F-22 Raptor's modernization processes to develop, test, and field new capability enhancements. This includes, but is not limited to, the expansion of a cloud-based software development environment and partnering with commercial companies to adopt industry product development best practices.\n\nThe Reliability and Maintainability Program provides for solution identification and integration of modifications to improve reliability, availability and maintainability for F-22 test aircraft, located at Edwards AFB. RAMP includes modifications to address corrosion, reduce maintenance hours, increase safety, and provide urgent response requirements to the F-22 CTF.\n\nF-22 Infrastructure efforts are conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as agile and lean.

Link 16 capabilities will be enabled by Open System Architecture (OSA) and enables 5th generation F-22 fighter aircraft to transmit tactical information through datalink to the 5th generation F-35 (a.k.a. 5th-to-5th), as well as to 4th generation aircraft (a.k.a. 5th-to-4th). Transmitting tactical data to other aircraft types via datalink is a top Air Force priority. With Link 16 Transmit, the F-22's superior 5th Generation sensor suite will critically support the situational awareness of all participants in the operational environment. Mode 5 IFF will deliver IFF Transpond and Interrogate capabilities. Mode 5 IFF is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council-mandated Blue Force identification capability that improves Raptor survivability and reduces fratricide risk DoD-wide.  Mode 5 IFF brings significantly enhanced combat identification in both quality and security. All capabilities will be fielded on the F-22 Block 30\/35 combat coded F-22 fleet.\n\nThe F-22's Link 16 and Mode 5 IFF developments are conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as agile and lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor enterprise to develop, test, and field software\/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.\n\nFY20 planned execution in sensor systems in BPAC 674785 will be $69M to include the $50M Congressional Add for F-22 Modernization.  FY20 planned execution in communication systems in BPAC 674788 will be $186M."

Link 16 Transmit will be accomplished via an Open System Architecture (OSA) integrated with F-22 legacy avionics. The OSA implementation will provide a pathway to more competitive and open  F-22 modernization. Mode 5 IFF also provides an opportunity to incorporate other updates to Link 16 capabilities into the Raptor. This major thrust also captures F-22 program activities related to integrating the advanced Talon SPITBALL Link 16 antenna onto the F-22. Includes mission support requirements for the F-22 Program Office to include, but not be limited to: travel, computer costs, cost estimating data, strategic analysis and support, systems engineering process management and other miscellaneous contract support.

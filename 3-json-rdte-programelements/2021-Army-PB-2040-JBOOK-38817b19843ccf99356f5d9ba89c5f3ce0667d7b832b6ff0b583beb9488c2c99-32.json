The IFPC Inc 2 requirement consists of a launcher, integrated fire control, sensor, and an interceptor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission and Objective counter-RAM mission with alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. \n\nEMAM is no longer acting as a separate program. EMAM will be incorporated into the IFPC Inc 2 program as a potential primary interceptor for the future Enduring IFPC Inc 2 system and provide kinetic intercept capability to defeat CM, UAS and RAM threats. EMAM is now known as the IFPC Inc 2 Interceptor with strategy and funding combined with the IFPC Inc 2 program beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.

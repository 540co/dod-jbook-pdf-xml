Additionally, provide funding for the Underbody Blast Modeling and Simulation support that provides early identification of vehicle improvements that directly impact Soldier survivability; improves test design; provides additional evaluation data to support acquisition. Also, provide funding for the Center for Reliability and Growth in response to policies mandating Reliability Growth programs and periodic assessments for major systems. AEC is projected to support over 100 acquisition milestone decisions and  will continue to provide Capability & Limitation Reports and safety verification documents to support real-world operations."

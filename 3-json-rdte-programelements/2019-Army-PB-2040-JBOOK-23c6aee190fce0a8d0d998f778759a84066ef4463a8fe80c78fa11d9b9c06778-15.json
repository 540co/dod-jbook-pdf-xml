Research focuses on infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track targets in all day\/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in all operational environments. This Project designs, fabricates, and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational understanding, persistent surveillance, and hostile fire detection. This Project investigates and designs novel sensor electronics such as Digital Read Out Integrated Circuits (DROICs) to enable multifunction sensing. This Project also investigates and matures new semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from the periodic table. In addition, this Project develops algorithms for enhanced IR functionality, which provides the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets. The reduction of size, weight and power - Cost (SWaP-C) is a key research objective for all efforts.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

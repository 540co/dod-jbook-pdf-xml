The MSVs are critical modernization efforts in support of the Army's Watercraft Transformation Strategy (AWTS) and Army Force Package 2.0. \n\nIn general, this project supports efforts and studies for advanced component development, including prototypes of equipment and sub-systems to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, and survivability while increasing the lethality, tactical mobility, and operational capability of the Army Mariner to preserve the Combatant Commanders requirement of \"freedom of seas\" access in all areas of the world particularly the littorals, to support maneuver operations in all Areas of Responsibility.\n\nIn addition, funded efforts will address critical gaps in these areas for the legacy fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies. To support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, funding efforts will include conducting trade studies, Business Case Analyses to inform the requirement development process, and support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The funding enables Army's compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and compliance with Environmental protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.\n\nFY 2021 RDTE dollars in the amount of $0.841 million supports modernization of the legacy fleet by investigating technology insertions, including, but not limited to: force protection, condition based maintenance, vessel electronics, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.\n\nIn FY 2021, $0.178 million in Reimbursable Manpower for this line has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance.  Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignments."

Additionally, this project supports enablers of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) which is a priority technology for the Network and Soldier Lethality CFT's.\n\nAs the DoD's Lead Standardization Activity for Tactical Electric Power (TEP), Project Manager Expeditionary Energy & Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2) matures and integrates technology that will improve the next generation of standard tactical power sources in support of all Services. It supports technical maturation of TEP systems that will extend Army operational mission reach and duration in support of the Army Operating Concept and Multi-Domain Battle. \n\nFunding supports modernization of the current Tactical Electric Power capability with technology insertions including, but not limited to hybrid capabilities, light-weight power solutions, vehicle\/tactical microgrid interoperability and Tactical Microgrid Standards (TMS).   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment an operational energy concepts."

These systems will fill identified theater capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, improve resource and energy efficiency and increase combat effectiveness. This Project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms. This Project develops critical enablers that support the Army Campaign Plan and Army Modernization Strategy by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment."

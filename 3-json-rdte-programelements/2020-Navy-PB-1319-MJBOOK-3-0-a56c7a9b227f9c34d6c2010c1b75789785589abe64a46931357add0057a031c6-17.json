Analyses spans the spectrum of conflict in a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) context to inform critical senior level decision makers of current and future national security issues and provides unique and distinct analytic capabilities that enable the collaboration and sharing of analyses that reduces the duplication of topics that are of broad interest. MCSS is an integral part of the Marine Corps and Joint Chiefs decision-making processes to organize, man, train, equip, sustain, and transform resources from the current to the future force.\n\nThis program element has been revised into two specialized analytical divisions: (1) External Analysis Division (EAD) - responsible for providing joint external analysis is the Marine Corps' sole representative in the joint modeling arenas.  Provides deployed on site professional operations analysis support to Special Purpose MAGTFs in CENTCOM and AFRICOM. (2) Combat Development Analysis Division responsible for executing a select portfolio of studies for senior leadership, Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) and Marine Corps Enterprise Integration Plan (MCEIP)."

The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.\n\nMarine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations."

FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research & Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items."

The wargaming capability facilitates the assessment and evaluation of operating and functional concepts, operational and technology-based approaches, current concepts of operations, and principles and methods that inform decisions in support of force development and requirements generation.  Wargaming capability results are used to develop, assess, and refine future operating and functional concepts across the full range of military operations (ROMO).  Additionally, they test current OPLANS and CONOPS; examine operational and tactical actions through repeated, multiple iterations; enable the full development of concepts through opportunities for examination and evaluation; assess capability investments while guiding capability resourcing actions and informing the POM development; and provide education and leadership development."

Research and analysis efforts support: design and coordinated implementation of an Objective Network to fight on and through a contested environment; design and collaboration on a Naval Tactical Grid and a Joint Tactical Grid; a threat estimate to inform capability development; and analysis to inform the development and fielding of an integrated information capability.  These efforts will be accomplished leveraging analytic support from government Labs and Industry to dynamically exploit our National Defense Strategy (NDS) priority operational problems related to the Information Environment through limited user evaluations and functional capability assessments with Marines. In addition, rapid development of capabilities to address problems in the IE Ops will be developed utilizing the Accelerator process which utilizes best commercial practice of design thinking."

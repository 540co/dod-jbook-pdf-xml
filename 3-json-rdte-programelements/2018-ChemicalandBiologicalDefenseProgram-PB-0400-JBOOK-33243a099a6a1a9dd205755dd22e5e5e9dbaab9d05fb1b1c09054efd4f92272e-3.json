            "val": "Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations\/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  ADC&P is conducted for an array of chemical, biological, and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning, collector concentrators, generic detection, improved reagents, and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and\/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent, treat, and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  \n\nThe Department of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and\/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&P, such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional \/ non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this ACD&P support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&P on these prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  \n\nThe Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process (\"One Portfolio\").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  \n\nACD&P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense systems.\n\nThe projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4."

Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).  Individual efforts are: (1) Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Integrated Early Warning (IEW), (2) Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (JCACS), (3) Manned Mounted Platform Radiological Detection System, (4) Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA), (5) Biosurveillance (BSV),  (6) Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Inc 2 (CBRN DRS Inc 2),  (7) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD),  (8) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense. \n\nThe Joint Force requires tactical, enhanced, and integrated Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) detection, protection, contamination mitigation, contamination characterization, situational awareness, and hazard understanding early warning capability and decision tools to provide operational commanders time and space to mitigate Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) effects. The Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Integrated Early Warning (IEW) will demonstrate these capabilities by enabling Joint operators to locate, track, identify, characterize, sample, digitally report, protect against, and mitigate CBRN threats by merging situational awareness to create understanding.  The ECD IEW will integrate advanced technologies to provide capability sets of equipment and situational awareness decision tools to protect against and mitigate the effects of contamination when operating in a CBRN environment.\n\nThe Joint Force requires enhanced and integrated Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) protection, contamination mitigation, contamination characterization, and situational awareness capability sets to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The ECD JCACS will demonstrate these capabilities by enabling Joint operators to locate, identify, characterize, sample, digitally report, protect against, and mitigate CBRN threats. The ECD JCACS will integrate advanced technologies to provide capability sets of equipment and situational awareness tools to protect against and mitigate the effects of contamination during WMD interdiction and site characterization missions.\n\n(MMPRDS) provides ruggedized, networkable detectors with a wide operating range of detection, including prompt neutron\/gamma, for integration into vehicles, fixed sites, and ships. It replaces the obsolescent UDR-13 and AN\/VDR-2 for mounted operations, providing warning and situational awareness for crews and personnel, and enables mounted RN surveillance and reconnaissance for platforms such as the NBCRV.\n\nThe ROSETTA as a FY18 new start is a chemistry based sensor to provide chemical detection and identification capability to the Warfighter. ROSETTA will provide improved surface hazard detection by developing an array of reactive chemistries onto a sampling ticket format to update the currently fielded M256A2.  The M256A2 technology data package will be updated with an engineering change proposal to create a new M256A3 kit.\n\nBiosurveillance (BSV) programs provide a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers\/diagnostics; and transition hardware\/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  BSV will align the biosurveillance efforts across DoD and national strategies.  BSV will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiatives.  BSV requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over eleven requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV supports Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD, JUONS CC-0557, and Analytical Framework which find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering CB threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a CB Event.  JUPITR ATD consists of four legs; Early Warning (EW), Biological Identification Capabilities Sets (BICS), Assessment of Environmental Detectors (AED), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP).  The JUPITR ATD provides the USFK with a holistic biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification, and theater confirmation of a CB event.  The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection\/diagnostic systems for the USFK.  Outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into relevant technologies that are currently programs of record (PORs) to include global-BSP, Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) and CALS.  Systems used in Operational Demonstration will be left behind with a two year sustainment plan for continuing use.  Whole system live agent test (WSLAT) of AED units will support the Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance business case analysis for maritime and fixed site Point Biological Detection.\n\nThe CBRN DRS Inc 2 will provide additional capability, not present in CBRN DRS Inc 1, for detection and identification of CBRN threats, personal protective equipment (PPE), and increased situation awareness through networking and communication of the hazard to support follow on technical forces conducting sensitive site assessment and elimination operations.  It will enhance the capability fielded in CBRN DRS Inc 1 to conduct dismounted CBRN reconnaissance, WMD detection or denial, characterization of hazardous material events or accidents, and sensitive site elimination.  CBRN Inc 2  will allow follow on technical forces to conduct  longer duration missions, field confirmatory CBRN identification, and reach back communications. The CBRN Inc 2  configurations will be tailored to meet individual Service mission tasks.  \n\nThe NGCD program is several detection systems for vapor and aerosol monitoring (NGCD 1), location of liquid and solids on surfaces (NGCD 2) and sampling of multiplephases of matter (NGCD 3).  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved NTA\/CWA\/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  There are four capability areas, of which three; NGCD 1 Detector Alarm, NGCD 2 Survey Detector and NGCD 3 Sample Analysis are in the Technical Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase.  The fourth capability, NGCD 4 Individual Detector - personal chemical detection is still in material solution analysis.  These sensors will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The scope of the project includes detection of chemicals a few feet away from the detector as well as the sampling point of the detector.\n\nThe NTA Defense program supports chemical and biological (CB) defense acquisition programs throughout entire acquisition process to address emerging threat requirements across the full spectrum of commodities.  Dedicated initiatives and projects transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition options\/efforts (Programs of Record, Enhanced Capability Demonstrations, and Accelerated Acquisition) that account for the breadth and depth of emerging threats which span the full range of military missions.  The NTA Defense program provides essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense concepts against emerging threats.  The program supports a balanced portfolio which targets capabilities to reduce operational and tactical risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats.  Additional efforts in conducting systems engineering analysis will occur in order to identify and consolidate capability knowledge gaps and prioritize required investments."

                            "val": "ENHANCED CAPABILITY DEMO INTEGRATED EARLY WARNING (ECD IEW)\n\nThe Enhanced Capability Demonstration Integrated Early Warning (ECD IEW) will conduct an analysis of alternatives and leverage the DTRA IEW ATD to procure developmental equipment for experimentation and demonstration to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS TTPs, Non-CBRN sensors, and requirements to provide operational commanders time and space for freedom to maneuver and action. The ECD IEW will utilize Table Top Exercises (TTX), Operational Demonstrations, and other test events to provide cross commodity equipment sets evaluation leading to the operational deployment to a unit to be determined, with two years of sustainment, further requirements development, CBDP program of record insertion, and concepts of employment.\n\nENHANCED CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATION JOINT CBRNE ADV CAPABILITY SETS (ECD JCACS)\n\nThe Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (JCACS) is an ECD that requires various sets of equipment to be evaluated during Army Warfighting Assessments (AWA) and other test events.  The acquisition strategy uses existing task-order contracts (including support contracts) and existing supply contracts from Programs of Record to acquire the equipment and technical support required for the effort.  Additionally, other Government Agencies and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers will be used to provide development, testing and technical support.\n\nMOUNTED MANNED PLATFORM RADIOLOGICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (MMPRDS)\n\nThe Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS) leverages technology transition with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) J9 NT to expedite technology maturation. DTRA-developed systems will provide component-level test data in support of Milestone B, after which Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts will be awarded for exterior-mounted and interior-mounted vehicle sensors. Milestone C will be supported at least in part by joint evaluation with the NBCRV Sensor Suite Upgrade program. Based on market research, available COTS solutions for interior-mounted vehicle sensors may result in further acquisition streamlining for a portion of the solution set.\n\nREACTIVE CHEMISTRY ORTHOGONAL SURFACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TICKET ARRAY (ROSETTA)\n\nThe Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA) will use a streamlined acquisition strategy.  This approach is based on the technology that will transition from the Science and Technology efforts.  An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) will be prepared to augment the M256A2 Kits.  Full and Open Competition will be utilized.\n\nBIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)\n\nBSV is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers\/diagnostics. These capabilities will transition as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  The JUPITR system of systems will be released to Busan Pier 8 and Camp Humphreys with a two year paid sustainment.  Lessons learned, technologies, concepts of employment from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as G-BSP, EMBD, NGDS, JBTDS & CALS).\n\nCBRN DISMOUNTED RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEMS\n\nBA4: The Chemical Biological Radiological Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) Inc 2 program will provide an Advanced Capabilities Set (ACS) for use by Joint Technical Forces in Sensitive Site Assessment in conjunction with their existing baseline CBRN DRS Inc 1 system.  The ACS will be comprised of Government (GOTS) and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment to the greatest extent possible.  The ACS will be used by Joint Technical Forces in conjunction to their CBRN DRS Inc 1 system to support Sensitive Site Exploitation.  Requirements analysis will support Materiel Development Decision and study guidance for the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The AoA will identify potential solutions and support further requirements development, culminating in an approved Capabilities Development Document. Contracting efforts will be initiated under the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition and Production Contracts.  Contracting will cover a base period of performance for development\/integration with options for Low-Rate and Full Rate Production (FRP).\n\nBA7: The Chemical Biological Radiological Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)\/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step acquisition approach to a full capability. This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, well-managed acquisition program. CBRN DRS systems will be produced using a workshare approach between Organic assets and Contractor production facilities.\n\nNEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)\n\nSystem Engineering and market survey results suggested the most effective way to develop NGCD was to divide the program into four unique capabilities to detect and identify the full spectrum of chemical compounds in all phases of matter.  There are four capability areas, of which three; NGCD 1, NGCD 2 and NGCD 3 were awarded contracts in the Technical Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase.  The fourth capability - personal chemical detection is still in technology development.  The Government awarded ten (10) contracts in June 2014 to support Technology Maturation Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition phase activities in three of the four capability areas: three (3) contracts for the NGCD 1 capability, four (4) contracts for the NGCD 2 capability, and three (3) contracts for the NGCD 3 capability; only 9 are still under contract.  Full and Open competition will be used to award at MS B Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts with production options for each capability.\n\nNON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)\n\nThe Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to develop countermeasures for all emerging threats across all commodities.  The NTA Defense program consists of a number of projects and initiatives through various types of contract actions (full and open competition, task order\/modifications, DLA) that enhance the CBDP's portfolio and mission and feed directly into Programs of Record, Enhanced Capability Demonstrations, and Acquisition Programs.  NTA Defense efforts: (1) evaluate COTS and GOTS technologies and systems, (2) conduct demonstrations and experiments, (3) integrate Intelligence Community threat analysis, operational risk analysis with systems technical performance to identify technologies or systems that can be rapidly developed, and deployed, and\/or transitioned to an Acquisition Program for technology insertion or derive an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to a fielded system, and (4) provide coordination of DoD, interagency, international NTA projects."

ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).\n\nThe programs supported under this Project include (1) Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS), (2) Tactical Disablement System (TACDS), and (3) Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS).  \n\nThe CHRS is a follow-on to the Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP). The CHRS will address two capabilities identified within the Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) Initial Capabilities Document: a Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) packaging solution to safely repatriate chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains to the Continental United States and a sustainable Contaminated Human Remains Decontamination System (CHRDS) to reduce the hazard to warfighters by decontaminating chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains. \n\nThe CHRT is a containment system which will protect personnel from the hazards associated with transporting human remains that are potentially contaminated with chemical, biological or radiological agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) without posing additional risk to the handlers or the environment in accordance with federal and international transportation standards.\n\nThe CHRDS is a system of tents, plumbing, generators, and medical equipment necessary to establish a decontamination site to perform decontamination, identification, and packaging of contaminated human remains for further disposition.  The CHRDS will reduce the hazards associated with contaminated human remains through decontamination of remains and enable positive identification of remains for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner before packaging in a CHRT.\n\nThe TACDS, a new start, shall be designed to meet the warfighters chemical materials of concern (CMOC) destruction needs. This system will provide a new deployable tactical disablement capability for small quantities of chemical and biological warfare materiel in bulk agent containers and munitions, used in an operational environment.  DoD's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Strategy enables early action through pathway defeat, shaping the environment to dissuade actors from pursuing WMD. The strategy also asserts the Department must respond effectively to WMD crises when called upon. The TACDS program will ultimately develop, integrate, test and produce a family of systems (FoS) which enable the Warfighter to Identify, Defeat, Disable, and Dispose of small quantities of Chemical Warfare Materials (CWM) or Biological Warfare Materials (BWM) in both bulk container(s) and assembled munitions. TACDS will consist of two capabilities; (1) Rapid Defeat System - Munitions, and (2) Rapid Defeat System - Agent.\n\nThe JBADS will provide the capability to conduct biological and chemical agent decontamination of the interior and exterior of aircraft and vehicle platforms.  The capabilities will be provided in two increments.  Increment  I will provide thorough biological decontamination of the interior and exterior of cargo aircraft.  The JBADS Increment I is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g. hot-humid air-blower, etc.), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination.  It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated airframes to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service.  Increment II will expand upon the Increment I capability set.  Increment II will develop multiple decontaminants and modular designs to address various platforms and chemical agent decontamination."

The FoS will address all Department of Defense mission profiles that could encounter chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, to include contingency and humanitarian operations. The ability to integrate with and protect individual Warfighter kits as part of the protective ensemble will be a critical function of solutions. This will give the Warfighters the ability to perform their mission functions in a CBRN environment while preserving their Warfighter kit to the maximum extent possible after departing a CBRN environment. The FoS will be developed based on Service mission profiles that will be agreed upon by Stakeholders."

The FoS will be developed based on Service mission profiles with the goal being to minimize operational burden and provide improved fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.  Pre-Milestone A activities included the exploration of available state of the art technologies through market research, Requests for Information, and a challenge competition; shaping realistic requirements by exploring trade space of novel technologies; and identified protection offered by non-chemical biological (CB) combat gear. The Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase will reduce technology, engineering, integration, and life-cycle cost risk. During this phase, the program will focus on forming mission profile areas designed to narrow the focus of solutions designed specifically for a certain Warfighter functional area. UIPE Increment 2 is a FoS and, therefore, will not be a single solution designed to have one suit meet the majority of Warfighter functions. Early testing will aide in deciding what is possible for each mission profile area and feed information in to the trade space analysis. Developmental\/Operational Testing will assess the ability of the solution to meet requirements, determine contractual compliance with the Performance Specifications, demonstrate system technical performance in accordance with the operational requirements, and demonstrate performance in realistic conditions. An Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach will be used to procure informational white papers during the TMRR phase, prototypes, and test articles of possible solutions. The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program. Procurement will be through either the OTA or a more traditional contracting vehicle.  In special circumstances, procurement may be awarded under the OTA if the contract falls under the procedures pursuant to the rules and regulations specified for this OTA. Otherwise, a production contract will be awarded via a more traditional contracting vehicle."

                            "val": "This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) responsible for providing the information architecture and applications for shaping the battlespace against the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threat.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.\n\nEfforts included in this project are: (1) the Biosurveillance Portal (BSP); (2) the Joint Effects Model (JEM); (3) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (4) the Software Support Activity (SSA).  \n\nThe Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) is an FY 2016 new start program to address USSOCOM requirements contained in an approved Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD).  BSP is a web-based enterprise environment that will facilitate collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events.  BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance domain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early identification and response to biological events.\n\nBSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental officers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force.  BSP does not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a centralized \"one-stop shop\" for all of their biosurveillance resources.\n\nThe Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the one and only accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents.  JEM is capable of providing all Warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical\/Material (TIC\/TIM) events and effects.  JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects into the Common Operational Picture (COP).\n\nFollow-on increments of JEM will refine and display hazard areas in near real time to reflect inputs such as meteorological, oceanographic, or actual agent concentration data. JEM will automatically receive input data from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system on which it resides, such as historical climatology, local observations, weather forecasts, natural environmental threats (i.e.: pandemic influenza, etc.), terrain data, intelligence information, or population data. JEM will also allow manual user input for factors such as concentrations of chemical warfare agents or actual exposure measurements and forecast sheltering stay-times and provide for modeling sheltering time through user-defined scenarios.\n\nThe Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) is an accredited Department of Defense (DOD) warning and reporting system that provides a standardized warning and reporting capability for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) incidents.  \n\nJWARN supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC) by improving force protection capabilities for units operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  JWARN provides an over-lay of NBC 1-6 reports on the Common Operational Picture, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command.  JWARN will be operated by CBRN and non-CBRN trained personnel operating in the operations center at various command nodes.  This provides commanders with situational awareness to inform decision making for force protection criteria, unmasking operations, decontamination, and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.  Future sensor configurations will forward sensor inputs directly to JWARN via established communication lanes, removing the man-in-the-loop requirement with the current system configuration.  JWARN will be information system classification agnostic and must be able to operate on unclassified, secret, top secret, and mission partner IT Systems without increasing system operator requirement, i.e.: sensor to COP via one communication loop.  As a result, sensors will then be able to communicate with JWARN on the same network, regardless of classification. \n\nThe Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity\/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management\/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies\/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information."

The BSP program will utilize the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for program requirements, management, and development. The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach. IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event. Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs). There are two planned Production\nCapability Drops and two Engineering Capability Drops planned in each FY. Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD to verify capabilities prior to delivery to the Warfighter. User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to elicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in July 2016. A Full Operational Test & Evaluation will be conducted prior to Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20.\n\nJOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)\n\nJEM Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.\n\nIT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.\n\nAs part of this strategy a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. \n\nThe current contractor for JEM Increment 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 \/ CD 2.1 documents. It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion. The follow-on contract in FY17 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract. The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.\n\nAn over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in Q4 FY14, and a CD1.1 Fielding Decision and a RDP-2 Build Decision were approved in Q3 FY16. Each subsequent RDP will have an single Build Decision and each CD will have an associated Fielding Decision.\n\nJOINT WARNING & REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)\n\nJWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  \n\nIT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.

These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.\n\nThe JWARN Program will find an appropriate Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).\n\nSOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)\n\nThe SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services."

Drug products will be developed targeting the pathogens on the biological warfare threat lists, such as Ebola.  This includes viruses of interest from the following families: Filoviridae, Alphaviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae.  Developed antiviral therapeutics will be employed after suspected or confirmed exposure to the relevant threat agents and AV TX MCMs will ameliorate the effect of threat agents to the warfighter. In the event of a natural occurring outbreak, antiviral therapeutics can be provided to ensure freedom of operation. \n\nThe Medical Countermeasure BSL-4 GLP Test and Evaluation capability performs T&E and provides the essential data packages to support US Food and Drug Administration approval of leading biodefense medical countermeasure candidates to protect the Warfighter and the Nation.  This capability provides dedicated capacity for DoD to conduct biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) T&E studies to meet programmatic needs following all applicable regulatory, biosurety, and safety standards.\n\nThe Agile Medical Paradigm (AMP) is the CBDP's strategic framework to accelerate the delivery of MCMs. To achieve this goal the DOD is establishing a medical countermeasures platform (MCMPT) capability.  The goal of the MCMPT is to counter a variety of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks. Efforts will center on leveraging the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and developing robust manufacturing processes.  \n\nThe Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins. The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.  \n\nThe NGDS Family of Systems program provides Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease diagnostic capabilities across several echelons of care, as well as for environmental sample analysis as part of the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS). The NGDS Increment 1 provides an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared reusable, portable biological pathogen diagnostic system to Army, Air Force and Navy deployable Combat Health Support units, to support near real-time patient treatment decision making, force health protection decision making and CBRN situational awareness.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) supports the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures are urgently needed to negate the threat of these biological warfare (BW) agents.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  \n\nThe Filovirus Vaccine (VAC FILO) Program develops vaccines that will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  The program office is prioritizing the development and delivery of a licensed Marburg vaccine while S&T further develops Ebola vaccine candidates to meet the DoD requirement.  The current budget supports development of multiple Marburg prototypes to protect against the BW threat through TMRR phase.  The DoD anticipates that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve a vaccine using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in a relevant animal model(s).\n\nThe Ricin toxin is a validated bioweapon threat that is lethal, available and easily produced.  The Ricin vaccine program (VAC Ricin) supports one DoD vaccine candidate including manufacturing cGMP lots; and the continuation of animal model and assay development studies.  The Ricin Vaccine will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to ricin toxin.\n\nThe Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine program initiated competitive prototypes in FY13 to reduce program risk, and is developing multiple prototypes through the Technology Development Phase.  The Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to three strains of alphaviruses; western, eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses.  The program office is prioritizing the development and delivery of a licensed VEE vaccine.\n\nAnthrax is a validated bioweapon threat for which the Force is being vaccinated against.  The current anthrax dose schedule requires up to 6 doses to be fully protective.  Health and Human Services has developed a next generation vaccine for post exposure to anthrax.  The DoD is seeking to leverage HHS development efforts and extend the label to pre-exposure to anthrax.  This will allow both the civilian and military populations to maintain the same standard of care."

                            "val": "MCM PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES (MCMPT)\n\nThe goal of the MCMPT is to counter a variety of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  BA5 Efforts will focus on establishing advanced platform technologies within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and evaluating that capability through  nonclinical and clinical testing.  The early stage efforts (BA4) are to develop standardized design capabilities to support a rapid response. Once established, future programs will be able to leverage this capability for the development of specific medical countermeasures. It is anticipated that these efforts will leverage the Other Transactions Authority through the medical OTA consortium.\n\nBSL4 GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES TEST & EVALUATION (BSL4 GLP T&E)\n\nThe Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCM) BSL-4 T&E capability continues to utilize and maintain the existing and planned new US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) facility and staff.  MCM BSL-4 T&E support costs during Phase 3 and beyond will be offset by costs from specific MCM development programs where possible.  The period of FY16 and beyond will continue secondary capability assessments and refinements and will focus on transition of the capability to the new USAMRIID facility, after which Full Operational Capability (FOC) will be reached.\n\nCOUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)\n\nThe CMDR-B Program develops MCMs for MDR (multi-drug resistant) bacteria, including BWAs and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US FDA approved to prevent or minimize effects from MDR bacterial exposures.  The CMDR-B program will follow an integrated product development process, and undergo independent regulatory affairs processes to achieve an FDA approved drug.  The CMDR-B program is establishing collaborative relationships with DoD, other USG entities, and commercial partners in order to populate the MDR pipeline which will help reduce program risk, potentially lower program cost, and accelerate delivery of MCMs to the Warfighter.  Leveraging collaborative Department of Defense (DoD), United States Government, and industry efforts will reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate the delivery of therapeutics to the Warfighter.  The program has established a translational team with the Joint Science and Technology Office for animal model work and pipeline candidates that could transition to CMDR-B for Advanced Development. The CMDR-B program also has a partnership with DHHS\/BARDA to manufacture developmental drug product that will support an Interim Fielding Capability for a plague therapeutic for post-exposure protection and treatment.  The CMDR-B program intends to have a Milestone B Decision Review in 1QFY19.  Results from the program investment in Non-Human Primate Pivotal efficacy testing, conducted in TMRR phase, in  FY17 may result in Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 8 mature candidates being ready for further development; therefore the CMDR-B program is likely to request the MS B Decision Review moved up to FY18.\n\nNEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)\n\nThe NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy. The NGDS Increment 1 is intended to replace the legacy\nJoint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. \n\nThe NGDS Increment 2 program addresses CBRN agents and concepts of employment (COEs) that the NGDS Increment 1 Film Array does not address. More than one materiel solution is required to expand the scope of CBRN agent diagnostics across multiple echelons of care. NGDS Increment 2 will employ a system of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, complementary bench top diagnostics, chemical diagnostics, and handheld disposable diagnostics. NGDS Increment 2 will initiate engineering development of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY17, while continuing to conduct risk reduction efforts for the other capabilities.  Separate decisions will be utilized  to establish programs of record for bench top, chemical and handheld disposable diagnostic capability development, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements.\n\nFILOVIRUS (VAC FILO)\n\nThe Filovirus Vaccine Program acquisition strategy supports the development of multiple vaccines through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase that will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  During this phase a manufacturing process is developed.  This process will be used to produce current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots suitable for Phase 1 clinical trials.  In addition, animal safety and efficacy studies will be conducted to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the FDA and conduct Phase 1 clinical trials.  These efforts will support a MS B decision and entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.   At Milestone B (MS B), the best Marburg vaccine prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the delivery of an FDA licensed Marburg vaccine.  It is anticipated that the EMD phase contract will be a mix of Cost Plus and Fixed Price.  In addition, the program office may leverage the Advanced Development and Manufacturing capability, and other DoD agencies and laboratories to include the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  Following a successful MS B, the program will conduct manufacturing qualification\/validation, expanded clinical and nonclinical testing, and assay qualification and validation efforts.  These efforts will support the Biological Licensure Application (BLA) submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and licensure of a Marburg vaccine.\n\nNEXT GENERATION ANTHRAX VACCINE (VAC NGA)\n\nThe next Generation anthrax vaccine program strategy supports extending the label indication on the Health and Human Services AVA vaccine, Nuthrax.  This effort will result in a vaccine product that has an improved on-set of protection with reduction in the number of doses needed to confer protection.  The label extension will allow the vaccine to be used for a pre-exposure event to anthrax which aligns with the current DoD vaccine policies.  During the TMRR phase of development, efforts will focus on conducting non-clinical dose range finding studies to determine the optimal dose to support the pre-exposure indication.  In the EMD phase of development, activities will include demonstration of a consistent manufacturing process for the pre-exposure dose and conduct Phase 3 human safety clinical trials.  It is anticipated that the EMD phase contract will be a mix of Cost Plus and Fixed Price.  These efforts will support the Biological Licensure Application (BLA) submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and licensure of a next generation vaccine.\n\nRICIN VACCINE (VAC RIC)\n\nThe Ricin Vaccine Program acquisition strategy supports the development of a single vaccine through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase that will offer protection against the threat of aerosolized ricin toxin.  The Government will serve as the integrator during the TMRR phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner with DoD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).\n\nWESTERN EASTERN VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPH VACCINE (VAC WEVEE)\n\nThe WEVEE acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of Virus Replicon Particle (VRP) and Virus Like Particle (VLP) vaccine prototypes through a Phase 1 clinical trials to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development phase.  Several potential decision points will be used to assess the prototypes for possible down select.  The schedule is based on a down select to one prototype.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with delivery of a FDA-licensed WEVEE vaccine.  The development efforts will be a Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price CLINs.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner with Health and Human Services\/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (HHS\/NIAID), DoD agencies, and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USMRIID).  This DoD program is the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.\n\nANTI-VIRAL THERAPEUTICS (AV TX)\n\nThe acquisition strategy combined the HFV and EID TX Program efforts beginning in FY17, into a single program to develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral countermeasures.  Independent market research conducted in FY15 identified multiple candidates appropriate for advanced development at varying stages of maturity.  A source selection was conducted targeting award in FY16.  Candidates selected for entry into the EMD phase of development will be executed under the Antiviral Therapeutic program in FY17.  Candidates selected which are appropriate for entry into the TMRR phase will be deferred for award until FY17 when BA4 funding is available to the program.  The overall regulatory approach of the program remains to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performers will submit New Drug Applications\/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutics during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment."

A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid\/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  The program currently includes: Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM).\n\nThe Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) advanced development provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  Components of the development include (1) a new and improved oxime (replacing 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM)) to provide protection across current and emerging threats, (2) expanded nerve agent indications for a fielded, single indication, pyridostigmine bromide (PB) product, and (3) insertion of a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.  The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA), while expanding warfighter pretreatment options."

This strategy employs an incremental approach to provide independent, and more rapid deliveries of oxime, expanded PB indications, and CA capabilities than in a combined treatment regimen delivery. In the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&RR) phase, close collaborations will occur with the science\/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of oxime and centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, clinical safety studies, and efficacy studies addressing the PB indication.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for the oxime and CA each capability, the Government will engage with commercial partner(s) to ensure that INATS development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines; the commercial partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies; the commercial partner(s) will also oversee the manufacture of improved oxime and CA formulations and delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The Government will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product.  In the Production and Deployment (P&D) Phase, the Government will pursue full-rate and stockpile production, conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies, and will transfer contracting\/logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) while remaining to monitor program performance through disposal as the life-cycle manager."

TESS test infrastructure products are aligned in three groups to include: (1) Analysis and Requirements; (2) Laboratory; (3) Field. \n\n(1) Analysis and Requirements: The products for this area are the analyses of requirements and justification of needs for test infrastructure to support acquisition efforts (e.g. Programs of Record (PORs), Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs), and Accelerated Acquisition).  The result is a verified need for component upgrades to existing test infrastructure, dynamic laboratory upgrades to existing test infrastructure, or initiation of new test infrastructure. \n\n(2) Laboratory: The products for this area are the Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS) and improvements to the Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC).  The NTADTS provides a new capability to conduct chemical defense testing against current and emerging threat agents.  The NTADTS supports testing of decontamination, collective protection, individual protection, and contamination avoidance products.  The DTC provides a new capability for testing chemical point detection systems against chemical warfare agents in various environmental conditions.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits (CBRN DRS), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) Increment 2 and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  Future efforts will include the development of test methods and methodologies for additional classes of agents.\n\n(3) Field: The products for this area are Test Grid, Safari Test Grid, Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT) and Active Standoff Chamber (ASC).  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented grid for chemical and biological simulant field test capabilities that integrate referee systems; dissemination equipment; real-time cloud tracking capability; meteorological equipment; a wireless network; and a Data Management System (DMS) software to track and display the simulant cloud; and provide status of all of the equipment in the network at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  The Safari Test Grid is an all-inclusive mobile management service functioning wirelessly, capable of integrating, controlling, commanding and managing all assets required to conduct chemical and biological (CB) tests at any Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  It provides algorithms and graphical user interfaces for automating real-time visualization, raw data, computation, hosts data collection and indefinite storage that can go to any MRTFB for CB Testing.  The JABT and ASC improvements will provide a tech refresh to existing infrastructure and allow establishment of test data correlation between laboratory-tunnels-field for test results.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).\n\nExperimentation and demonstration will be used to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs."

The U.S. Army is the JLTV service lead.  The JLTV Program entered the Production and Deployment Phase with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorization on 25 August 2015.  With Milestone C approval, the LRIP fixed price contract was awarded to Oshkosh Defense LLC on 25 August 2015.  \n\nThis contract consists of a three year LRIP period with options for five additional years of FRP deliveries. JPO JLTV procured the Technical Data Package (TDP) with appropriate data rights to allow for possible future competition for production vehicles and spares. Current contract options may be exercised through 30 November 2023 assuming contractual quantity headspace is still available. Current funding indicates headspace quantity of 16,901 may be achieved in FY 2021, with competitive follow on contract award anticipated in FY 2022.    \n\nThe approved Full Rate Production (FRP) joint cost position validated the requirement for continuing RDT&E for system enhancements.\n\nThe JLTV program will continually monitor emerging technologies and capabilities through its partnerships with U.S. Army and Marine Corps science and technology organizations as well as through industry market research and partnerships. The JLTV program will look for opportunities to implement increased capabilities throughout the systems' life cycle."

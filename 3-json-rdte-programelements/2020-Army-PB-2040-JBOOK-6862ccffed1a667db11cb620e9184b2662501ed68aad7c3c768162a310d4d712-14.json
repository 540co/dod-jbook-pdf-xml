JTE examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies' mission gaps, tactics and doctrine, resulting in the development of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and assessment documents. Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. OTC conducts independent operational tests that provide significant data to Army decision-makers on key Army systems and concepts. This PE finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment."

Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs) and Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to the Army test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) as the joint OTA.  Mission support for JTE includes supporting two Joint Tests under the Joint Test program, and assigned special projects. ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, Suffolk VA, United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) J81 (Hawaii), and Marine Corps Warfighter Laboratory (Quantico, VA) with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support. JTE supports Joint Tests until these Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM."

OTC conducts independent operational tests required by public law (Title 10 USC 2399) that provide significant data to Army decision makers on key Army systems and concepts. This Project finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.  \n\nOTC consists of four forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air and Missile Defense Test Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; Fires Support Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and the Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate, Fort Huachuca, Arizona) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Fort Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives. The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), Limited User Test (LUT), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE)."

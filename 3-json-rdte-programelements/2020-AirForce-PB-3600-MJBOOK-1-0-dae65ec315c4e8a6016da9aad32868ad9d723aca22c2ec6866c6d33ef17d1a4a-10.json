The Universal Navigation Interface project developed, enhanced, and implemented standardized interfaces in current\/future aircraft and mission planning to support integration of EGI receivers independent of Operational Flight Program (OFP) cycles. Standardization of navigation-aircraft interface enables a more affordable approach and faster upgrade capabilities to an ever changing threat to navigation accuracy.\n\nPE 0604201F, Project 641030 covers the development, integration and testing of Enhanced Anti-Jam (EAJ) Military Code (M-Code) GPS receivers for AF and joint weapon systems. This includes updates to weapon mission planning software to support new M-Code and EAJ receiver development. These acquisitions will enable the Air Force to increase its operational PNT resiliency while satisfying the DoD and civil mandates. Fielding of EAJ M-Code weapons requires the development, integration\nand testing of M-Code receivers across the AFPEO Weapons Portfolio.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver M-Code Development capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

This approach uses a combination of contract types based on acquisition phase (TMRR, Development, Production) and risk.  The Weapons SPOs share a common development PE to allow flexibility in funding and planning, switching to individual PEs for receiver integration, operational testing, and production.  The M-Code\/EAJ Weapons Receiver Development effort leverages technology currently under development by the GPS-D MGUE program and will provide the warfighter with unmatched capability to operate in future A2\/AD environments."

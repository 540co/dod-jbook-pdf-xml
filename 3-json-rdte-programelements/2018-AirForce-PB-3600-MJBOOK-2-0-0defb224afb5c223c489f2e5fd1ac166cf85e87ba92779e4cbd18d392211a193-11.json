The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.\n\nThe B-1B modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. \n\nFULLY INTEGRATED TARGETING POD (FITP)\nFully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) Modification permanently integrates the advanced targeting pod (ATP) capability into the B-1B\u2019s avionics flight software and replaces the B-1B\u2019s Temporary T-1 Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS)\/Laptop Controlled Targeting Pod (LCTP) system with increased situational awareness, weapons de-confliction, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance within the Combat Air Forces (CAF).  FITP will provide robust combat targeting processing power, computing speed & throughput for aircrew mission planning, a permanent sustainment support structure.  It will provide all four crew members access to targeting pod information displayed on digital high definition quality video using the Integrated Battle Station (IBS) multi-function displays (MFDs) and cursor controller.  FITP will address the aircrew ergonomic issues caused by the current system configuration, allowing more rapid prosecution of targets with improved integration with Avionics Flight Software (AFS) capabilities.  In addition, FITP will provide growth capability for implementation and interaction with follow-on systems to augment targeting pod use.  Furthermore, the Fully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) removes the need for Interim Contractor Support (ICS) sustainment support structure, resolving DMS issue.\n\nMODE 5\/S AUTOMATIC SURVEILLANCE BROADCAST (ADS-B) OUT\nB-1 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 is the replacement for the B-1 Mark XII IFF Mode 4. Mode 5 will provide secure target identification and will be a response system for Combat Identification. Mode Select (Mode S) and ADS-B Out provides timely aircraft position and flight path prediction to receiver units for Air Traffic Control, Air Defense System and\/or aircraft. The IFF Mode 5 upgrade uses an automated system that responds to interrogations to avoid loss of B-1 aircraft through fratricide. Upgrades to ADS-B Out and Mode S are required Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to field by January 2020 and upgrade to Mode 5 is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) mandate to field by September 2020. Failure to meet mandates will result in delayed\/denied service within controlled airspace in the United States and Europe. Funds are included to accommodate the FAA mandate for ADS-B and Mode S and JROC mandate\nfor Mode 5 as outlined throughout previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.\n\nRADIO CRYPTO COMPLIANCE\nThe B-1 Radio Crypto Compliance requirements originated to meet DoD mandates by 1 Jan 2020. If the requirements are not met, B-1 is at risk of losing secure line of sight and beyond line of sight communication (BLOS) with ground and air forces. Without the radio crypto compliance the B-1 will not be able to participate in CONUS\/OCONUS military operations. The program replaces the existing radios with Crypto Compliant radios providing BLOS communications. Funds are included to accommodate DoD mandate as outlined throughout previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.\n\nMultifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) \u2013 Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)\nThe B-1 Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) \u2013 Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) replaces the existing MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) 1 Link 16 terminal to meet National Security Agency (NSA) Crypto Modernization (CM) Device Cease Key and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Frequency Remap mandates; systems become non-compliant in 2025.  MIDS-JTRS resolves all LVT 1 deficiencies and adds substantial combat capability enhancements to Link 16 Enhanced Throughput (LET) and Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN-4) with Concurrent Retention Receive (CRR).  MIDS-JTRS also provides multi-datalink capability, improving situational awareness and allows rapid inflight retargeting in cooperative combat environment.  Funds are included to accommodate DoT\/DoD approved Frequency Remap and Crypto Modernization Device Cease Key mandates as outlined throughout previous Air Force (AF) and Department of Defense (DoD) budget exhibits.\n\nBomb Rack Unit (BRU) 56 \nBomb Rack Unit (BRU) 56 will solve a safety risk with the legacy BRU-56 ejector rack. The upgrade will alleviate the deficiency within the current ejector rack as well as add increased carriage capability. Prolonged use resulted in a deficiency with the rivets within the linkage of the rack. This deficiency caused failure in one 2003 Class A mishap, one 2010 Class C mishap and multiple ground mishaps. The BRU-56 modification avoids future bomb rack mishaps and the possibility of a catastrophic aircraft loss as well as the loss of life.\n\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) Military-Code (M-Code)\nThis project will integrate a  military GPS receiver delivering improved capabilities to allow for accurate and reliable positioning, navigation, and timing for B-1 primary flight instrumentation, navigation, radar, weapon, and communication systems where current receiver performance might be compromised or unavailable.  M-Code has a higher-power signal offering better resistance to jamming and interference; advanced security features to prevent unauthorized access or exploitation by adversaries; and improved message formats and signal modulation techniques for faster and more accurate performance.\n\nINTEGRATED BATTLE STATION (IBS) SIMULATOR DEVELOPMENT\nB-1B training systems upgrades (both flight and maintenance simulators\/trainers) provide required training assets for the aircraft Central Integrated Test System(CITS),Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) modernization projects. These upgrades are required to bring the simulators up to the same configuration of the modernized aircraft. The B-1B training system provides the warfighter with a fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training capability in flight operations, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system.\n\nFLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT UPGRADES\nUpgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization projects to keep the test flight systems current. RDT&E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU. Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration. Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established. Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability, maintainability, and reliability for continued and future flight tests.\n\nGAP & INTEGRATION ANALYSIS\nAdditionally, program funds cover engineering\/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary equipment needed for development projects that have not yet fielded. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing source issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost. All B-1B development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.\n\nFunding is also required to ensure test asset availability for testing of aircraft RDT&E efforts.  This Program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-1B weapon system capability.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

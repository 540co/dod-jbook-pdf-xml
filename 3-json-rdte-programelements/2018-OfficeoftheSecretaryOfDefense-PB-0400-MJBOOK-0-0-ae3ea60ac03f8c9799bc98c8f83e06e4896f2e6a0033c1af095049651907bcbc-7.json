            "val": "Our military forces require resilient and reliable networks, information, and weapons systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cyber security of all Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure our missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to: develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new and resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military\u2019s ability to disrupt, fight and survive nation-state actors\u2019 cyber-attacks, measure the state of health in cyber security, explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, along with the ability to protect tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.\n\nThis program is unique in that it integrates both the defensive and offensive Cyber research from each of the Services to develop interoperable, defense-wide technology options targeted to meet Combatant Command (CCMD) needs and requirements. More specifically, by increasing cross-laboratory collaboration, this program is able to take Service-specific technologies and expand their applications to the Joint force."

Recently, S&T gaps were enumerated and described in several studies, including the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2016 Commission Enhancing National Cybersecurity and the 2017 Defense Science Board Research Enterprise Assessment.  The Cyber Applied Research program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  The program expands research in cyber command-and-control to provide Warfighters and commanders with tools and technologies to enable cyber situational awareness and protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms. Current technical thrusts include: Foundations of Trust, Resilient Infrastructure, Assuring Effective Missions, Cyber Modeling, Simulation & Experimentation, and Embedded, Mobile & Tactical Environments.\n\nAs adversaries develop more sophisticated technology, tactics, and become more skilled and better funded, the Cyber S&T Community must remain agile, vigilant, and evermore creative in response.  To bolster this program and address future threats, starting in FY 2017 a new strategic vision was directed at enhancing the DoD\u2019s tactical edge in the rapidly evolving cyber domain where many aspects still remain unexplored.  Judiciously investigating these aspects by investing in the research thrust areas identified below can provide a distinct advantage in future cyber conflicts: \n\n\u2022 Behavioral Cyber Sciences: The interaction between computers and human behavior. Moving beyond signals (ones and zeroes) towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral sciences will increase the effectiveness of tools, the cyber workforce, and cyber solutions at DoD scale.  Behavioral cyber sciences seeks to uncover details about how humans (to include operators, users, adversaries, and\/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood from a behavioral science standpoint and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcome.  \n\n\u2022 Self-securing weapons, systems, and networks: Thriving in a contested cyber environment.  New sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity will help keep pace with the growing complexity of weapon systems and help the DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.\n\n\u2022 Foundations of precision cyber operations: Precision bombing campaigns for the cyber domain.  Accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects will help the DoD leadership achieve the desired effects of cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.\n\n\u2022 Mathematical Foundations of Cyber Security: New tools to address new problems.  Advances in mathematical foundations of cyber S&T will cut across focus areas and produce new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.\n\nAdvances in these new cyber S&T focus thrust areas will help to promote strong foundations and disruptive innovations that will create surprises, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas will be critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cyber security beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense."

The impact of research under \u201cPump-II\u201d provided the war-fighter with improved sensitive data correlation and intelligent data decision capabilities.  A number of transitions are under way with the Naval Air Systems Command, Triton Unmanned Aircraft System Program Office for Pump-II with Secret and Below Interoperability certification and the Office of Naval Research Integrated Topside and Multi-Link Common Data Link System with Top Secret and Below Interoperability certifications.\n\nThe \u201cTactical Platform Resiliency\u201d project executed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) improved the design and robustness of various fault tolerant tools used to harden critical control systems.  The effort also designed and developed capabilities to monitor and autonomously remove malicious code and commands and data from compromised networks. \n\nThe \u201cControl Flow Integrity Monitoring\u201d project executed by JHU\/APL developed methods of detecting \u201creturn-oriented\u201d programming attacks using record-and-replay technology.  This technology enabled the rapid detection of some zero-day attacks that otherwise bypass all modern defenses.  This eliminated the effectiveness of a large class of exploits. \n\nA second JHU\/APL executed project, \u201cSystem Cloaking Defense through Deception,\u201d demonstrated ways to present decoys to adversaries and detect their presence and activities.  A major impact of the project raised attacker workloads, confused, delayed, and disrupted an adversary\u2019s ability to execute exploitation operations.  System cloaking is being considered for transition to a number of organizations namely ONR, Army Cyber (ARCYBER), Marine Force Cyber (MARFORCYBER) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)."

The vast majority of DoD weapons systems, platforms, and networks rely on software to operate.  Software can often be disrupted remotely, which necessitates a new kind of security to protect against cyber-attacks.  Defending the software- and network-based aspects of critical weapon systems is challenging for a number of reasons, chief among which is the advanced nature of the adversary in the cyber realm.  We can expect future cyber adversaries to be well-funded, well-informed, and agile.  Building weapon systems, platforms, and networks that can defend themselves in real time will be vital in protecting ourselves against this adversary.  We need systems that can autonomously monitor and manage their own health and security posture through advanced sensing and perception, reasoning, and planning.  Such systems could identify and classify threats much more quickly than a human operator, and therefore, able to neutralize the threat more quickly and effectively.  However, researchers must be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of turning security over to autonomous systems.  Verification techniques must be developed to ensure that autonomous and dynamic system changes maintain correct mission-focused capabilities without introducing unintended vulnerabilities.  Conversely, developing techniques to track and audit actions taken by autonomous systems is crucial to ensure that direct control can be reasserted, potentially reversing some actions, if necessary."

Cyber operators often have incomplete information about their target prior to completing an action.  The lack of a complete picture makes it difficult to predict the precise outcomes or collateral damage caused by a cyber operation. In this type of uncertain environment, military leaders may be acting with an undue sense of caution in using cyber capabilities.  Improved technology and techniques for quantifying cyber effects, estimating their cost and effectiveness, predicting consequences, and ensuring precise effects will help both to limit collateral damage and to ensure that a chosen action has the intended effect upon the adversary.  Highly precise and predictable cyber effects can also achieve mission goals despite the presence of both incomplete and maliciously-created false information."

This includes performing analyses, demonstrations, and programmatic assessments of technology, operations, requirements, and weapons systems.  In coordination with Services and CCMDs, JIAMDO Core also funds the definition, assessment, development, and approval of Joint IAMD operational concepts, operational architectures, and capability requirements to guide the Department's joint\/interagency\/combined fully integrated and net-centric capable IAMD (including defense against cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ballistic missiles).  JIAMDO Core also provides funding to:\n\n1. Develop and integrate joint studies, simulations, wargames, force resource allocation, and interoperability initiatives.\n\n2. Manage relevant Congressional interaction and CCMD interface through a cadre of liaisons collocated with major headquarters.\n\n3. Directly support and sponsor homeland air surveillance-related demonstration and analysis activities.\n\n4. Run the IAMD Working Group and co-chair the Protection Functional Capabilities Board focusing CCMD, Joint Staff, and Service collaboration efforts in generation of joint concepts and development of the IAMD architecture and roadmap.\n\n5. Develop U.S. positions for, and provide the U.S. head of delegation to, the NATO Air and Missile Defense Committee.\n\nJIAMDO Core enables strategic planning development, infrastructure, security, travel, and other support activities.  Funding pays for: contracted Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) support for Air & Cruise Missile Defense (ACMD), Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Homeland Air Security (HAS) strategic planning, studies & analysis, combat ID, modeling & simulation, all other JIAMDO analytical functions and products, senior level briefings, and all travel costs for government and contractor support personnel (including Combatant Commander liaison personnel). Additionally, the JIAMDO Core budget funds daily on-site security management personnel to meet DoD, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and other security regulations, for all administrative and support functions related to higher security classifications, as well as basic office supplies and furniture, and classified\/unclassified data connections."

JIAMDO is the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads mission area and utility analyses for air and missile defense, integrates air and missile defense within the force protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in development of the IAMD Prioritized Capability List, the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment, and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.

JIAMDO is the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in development of the IAMD Prioritized Capability List, the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment, and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues."

JIAMDO is the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads mission area and utility analyses for air and missile defense, integrates air and missile defense within the force protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in development of the IAMD Prioritized Capability List, the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment, and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues."

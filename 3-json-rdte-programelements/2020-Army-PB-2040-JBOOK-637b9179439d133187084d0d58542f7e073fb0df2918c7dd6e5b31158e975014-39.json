            "val": "Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. \n\nSmall Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI)is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.  \n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical \/ Infrared \/ Laser Designator (EO\/IR\/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day\/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery and the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO\/IR\/LD sensor for the Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities. Current product improvements continue to focus on the development and implementation of technologies that directly support emerging requirements of the Army's Current and Future Force.     \n\nProject 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  \n\nProject 123:   The UAS Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC\/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP)."

The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. Full Rate Production (FRP) was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform.  Based on Initial Operational test and Evaluation (IOT&E) results, STARLite is increasing its software capabilities to increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) and aligns SPE with the COE requirements. The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness. A competitive Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and begin the development of the software  improvements.  Integration onto the Gray Eagle will be done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI.\n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) EO\/IR\/LD enables the Gray Eagle to meet KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirements. The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in November 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. Full Rate Production (FRP) was achieved in June 2013. A three (3) year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform RDT&E activities. The Enhanced EO\/IR Capability Production Document, approved 19 December 2016, defines additional KPP requirements for Full Motion Video (FMV) sensors. The first KPP increases detection, recognition, and identification requirements which can only be met with the High Definition (HD) variation of the CSP. Currently, units are being fielded HD CSPs, with additional HD CSPs in production and retrofit. The second KPP requirement is for the CSP to be a metric sensor providing rapid and enhanced Target Location Accuracy (TLA). A five (5) year follow-on production and system support contract is scheduled for award in June 2019 for integration, test, upgrade, and sustainment of these enhanced capabilities. The FY 2020 acquisition strategy for CSP includes: maturation of hardware and software product improvements, production of qualification assets and initiation of testing necessary to meet identified CSP-TLA requirements, and efforts to improve situational awareness, provide multiple fields of view, and enhance targeting capabilities as CSP-TAI transitions from an S&T effort to development.\n\nThe acquisition strategy is to complete STARLite SPE software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle."

The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigured to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.\n\nNo Investment Funding for (FY 2019- beyond) for TSP POR."

The TSP program completed the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition with a period of performance that was completed in October 2015, and focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform, and integration and test of TSP software into the Operational Ground Station. The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program. \n\nThe TSP program entered the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase with a Milestone C decision that was approved on 2 May 2014. The TSP Program LRIP contract award was based on sole source selection with a period of performance that was completed on June 2016, and primarily focused on the obsolescence of the EMD phase assets via the required Engineering Change Proposals, and the first initial production of 30 TSP Payloads in support of the Gray Eagle Platform. The TSP Program ICLS contract award was a result of  previous sole selection with a period of performance of 12-months with a 5 year option for total completion into August 2021. The primary focus supports fielding of system, continuous contractual support through operational and sustainment transition, engineering corrective actions, support of the MQ-1C (ER), and the conversion of the 30 LRIP TSP systems. \n\nThe TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record capability. TSP Beyond Block 1 will address objectives and remaining deferred Block 1 threshold requirements as reflected in the approved Capability Production Document (CPD). \n\nImproved Gray Eagle (IGE)- Program Manager Unmanned Aircraft Systems(PM UAS)received a Congressional plus up of $49M President's Budget 2015 to procure Extended Range UAS which increases the CPD objective endurance requirements for the current GE configuration to an Improved Gray Eagle (IGE)."

The JTC\/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support.  The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE enhancements.\n\nThis system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).\n\nContinued integration of Night Vision Image Generator (NVIG) into the Modeling & Simulation domain as it pertains to UAS simulation.  Terrain, and model development for NVIG and Virtual Reality Scene Generator (VRSG) to increase fidelity.  Support of theater level Exercises, Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG), Yama Sakura (YS) and Key Resolve (KR).  Improvement of mapping capability for mission planning.  Redesign of Windows Entity Server (WES) and NetLink to improve network routing, thus lessening bandwidth consumption.  Incorporation of Common Image Generator Interface to provide an Image Generator (IG) agnostic solution thereby allowing for other IGs to be supported that are currently not supported.  Continued implementation of tactical protocols into the simulation domain to enhance interoperability.  Development of a Heads Up Display (HUD) designer application that will allow for the creation and modification of HUDs without having to touch the software baseline thereby reducing costs and increasing fidelity and speed of solution in theater.

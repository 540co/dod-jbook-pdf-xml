The N-CFT engages in expert analysis, focused experiments, and technology demonstrations to narrow capability gaps. Subsequent to a materiel development decision, the N-CFT develops and refines capability documentation aligned with the appropriate phase of the program. The N-CFT will inform technology transitions, research and development, and user assessments, and then rapidly transition Operational Requirements into the Army Acquisition System.  The N-CFT will integrate and synchronize activities across the Army, tied to Joint requirements, focused to improve speed, capability, and cost of materiel solutions to meet the Chief of Staff of the Army's (CSA's) first order principles, characteristics, and Warfighting requirements.\n\nUnified Network Transport supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line Of Effort (LOE) 1 - Unified Network; LOE 2 - Common Operating Environment (COE); LOE 3 - Interoperability; and LOE 4 - Command Post Mobility and Survivability. Funds will (1) identify and acquire technologies to address identified gaps across the Lines of Effort in the Integrated Tactical Network\/Enterprise Network, Tactical Network Transport, Computing Environments, Interoperability and Command Posts, and (2) conduct demonstrations and experimental testing in lab and operational environments on the technologies. Successful solutions identified through the experimentation will be transitioned to Programs of Record for integration and fielding. Funds for experimentation will also support integration with solutions identified in the other Modernization CFT efforts to ensure their network dependencies are addressed."

Solutions to solve current issues of lengthy set-up and tear-down times, survivability, mobility, suitability and physical size are also resolved in this LOE.  A key deliverable is an integrated body of requirements that meet operational needs in all aspects of CP operations. \n\nThis funding is used to identify and acquire technologies for experimentation that enhance or address gaps associated with LOE 4, Command Post, in the overall Integrated Tactical Network.

The Army network will provide resiliency through path diversity and dynamic routing to ensure tactical units can communicate in hostile environments. It will provide multiple ways to communicate and give commanders the ability to choose their communications methods and tools during operations. It fully incorporates cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.\n\nThis funding is used to identify and acquire technologies to enhance or address gaps associated with LOE 1, Unified Network, for experimentation and demonstration in the overall Integrated Network. The Unified Network LOE enables a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide and in any environment. It will increase bandwidth and range; improve mobility and network security; and harden the network. This will require the creation of a standards-based network architecture that effectively integrates enterprise and deployed network capabilities across domains and environments, and features a unified transport layer that permits \"plug and play\" for specific network capabilities. LOE 1 addresses the following operational requirements: Converged Mission Command Network, Network Augmentation \/ Extension, and Synthetic Training Environment.\n\nLOE 1 enhancements include Aerial Tier (WGS Ka Band Surrogate), CEMA resiliency, and cyber hardened communications."

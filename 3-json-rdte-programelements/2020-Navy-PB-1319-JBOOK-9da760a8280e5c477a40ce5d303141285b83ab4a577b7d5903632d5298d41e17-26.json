            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program.  These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts.  They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.  INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities.\n\nThe projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future. The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be modified or established to support further development.  These technology investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nDeveloping INPs requires the development of subsystems and components, and efforts to integrate these subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and tests in an appropriate environment. The efforts funded within this Program Element (PE) include concept and technology demonstrations of components and subsystems, which may be form, fit and function prototypes or scaled models that serve the same demonstration purpose.  The goal of these development efforts is to prove the technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  By demonstrating the general military utility and direct relevance to identified military needs, the technology becomes available for transition and further development within an emerging or new Program of Record.  INP investments do not necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases, but they do have the goal of moving out of Science and Technology (S&T) and into the acquisition process within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.  Because to the nature of these projects described, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

Relevant naval cyber tools will be developed and tested to verify the technology can autonomously perform cyber vulnerability assessments and implement mitigation strategies that protect naval platforms from unauthorized cyber intrusions. New cyber autonomy tools will be developed to protect critical naval warfighting capabilities supporting multiple missions, including time critical strike, expeditionary warfare, anti-surface warfare, and anti-air warfare. These tools, which rely on cyber components, will be developed and demonstrated over an extended period of time at several integrated hardware in-the-loop facilities across the Naval Research Enterprise. Optimized cyber resiliency warfighting effectiveness will be developed and demonstrated.

Conduct development and planning for a demonstration of the system's ability to autonomously perform an assault support mission in an operationally representative environment. This demonstration will include performing autonomous take-off, conducting en route navigation, approaching and landing at multiple unprepared landing zones using supervisory control managed by a minimally trained Marine via a tablet-based application, detecting and avoiding ground based obstacles, and safely operating in degraded visual environments.\n\nClaws \nInitiate Claws which will develop the autonomy required to operate large and extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in an anti-access, anti-denial environment. To support large and extra-large UUV operations further forward and farther from the battle group, the technology will be evolved to allow operations with limited navigational fixes and limited communication opportunities. During FY18, at-sea testing of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 research technologies will be initiated in a realistic environment. At-sea data will be collected to support the further development of Claws technologies emerging out of the Claws applied research effort in PE 0602792N.

Conduct a demonstration of the LDUUV fuel cell system installed in an LDUUV vehicle operating in an Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) like mission for 60 days. Continue to document the data analysis from the technology development in order to transition the information to Program Executive Office for the Littoral Combat Ship.\n\nLow-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST)\nInitiate the Advanced Technology Development effort for the LOCUST project, which will ultimately deliver a scalable system of inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and payloads that will provide game-changing disruptive capabilities over a wide range of military operations and areas of operations. LOCUST will make advances in unmanned system collective autonomous behaviors, robust low probability of interception or detection ad hoc networks, and payload miniaturization and modularity breakthroughs to counter threats in constrained urban environments, as well as large-scale anti-access area denial defenses. This will be accomplished at greatly reduced cost and risk when compared to traditional manned platform target prosecution. During FY18, the LOCUST program will begin to develop a range of key technologies that will be integrated together in order to demonstrate a scalable system of inexpensive, commoditized, swarming UAVs that provide disruptive capabilities. Critical milestones for each major sub-system and system will be established, as well as a revisit to requirements and metrics throughout. Yearly war games will be utilized to shape and inform the demonstrations, which will be of increasing complexity in both mission and operating environment. The demonstrations in turn will provide the Navy with an ability to spiral out capability as needed. FY18 demonstrations are planned to encompass missions utilizing intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and kinetic strike payloads.\n\nMedium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV)\nContinue the MDUSV project, which was previously funded predominantly in 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology\nDevelopment. The MDUSV project will design and build a prototype MDUSV platform sized for theater or global\nindependent operations. New autonomy, Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies will be integrated into the MDUSV platform. The capability of the MDUSV to autonomously perform ASW, MCM and EW missions over an extended period of time will be demonstrated during a 40-day period of at-sea testing. The capability to autonomously operate in all-weather conditions, using new technologies that provide robust perception using Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors that detect low radar cross-section craft with reduced vulnerability to jamming and reduced Radio Frequency (RF) emissions, will be assessed. The use of integrated acoustic and High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) mine influence sweep technologies as well as a novel ASW sensor suite that includes an advanced version of the Non-Traditional Sensor System (NTSS) will be tested on an instrumented range.\n\nTern\nComplete Tern, a joint Office of Naval Research (ONR) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) effort, previously funded in Program Element (PE) 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development.

Joint Regional IAMD Capability Mix (JRICM) II is a DepSecDef and JROC directed Regional IAMD study, directing the Joint Staff, Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO), in coordination with USSTRATCOM, USCYBERCOM, Intelligence Communities, Agencies and Services to assess the impact of emerging non-kinetic capabilities to supplement regional IAMD.\n\nJIAMDO-Homeland:  Program development and management were handed off to the Air Force. JIAMDO retains only requirements and integration oversight responsibilities not requiring program funding.  \n\nJIAMDO-Nimble Fire:  Increased funding for FY 2018 will be used to hold two large Nimble Fire events in support of U.S. Fleet Forces Command, USPACOM, USSTRATCOM and USEUCOM.  Additionally, funds will be used to improve Electronic Warfare, Multi-spectral Environment, Advanced Capability Model, and Space Warfare."

JIAMDO is the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in development of the IAMD Prioritized Capability List, the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment, and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues."

JIAMDO is the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in development of the IAMD Prioritized Capability List, the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment, and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues."

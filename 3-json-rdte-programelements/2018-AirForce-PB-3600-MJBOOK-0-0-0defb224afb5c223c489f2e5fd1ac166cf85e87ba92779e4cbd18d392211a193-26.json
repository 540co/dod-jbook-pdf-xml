            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates Air Force enterprise-centric information technologies for the warfighter. The Global Battlespace Awareness project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and total battlespace awareness by using and exploiting information from all sources. The Assured Worldwide Connectivity project provides advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global military operations, including a secure information grid for worldwide information exchange of near-real-time multimedia (i.e., voice, data, video, and imagery) information. In addition, this project develops and demonstrates advanced optical networking and communications for Air Force air and space-based information exchange on and between platforms. These optical networks will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs) and air and space- based platforms either en route or in theater. This project also provides tools and applications leading to the development and integration of cyber deterrence technologies resulting in a strategic capability of cyber dominance within the secure information grid. The Knowledge Management and Computing project develops the technology applications that will provide for a secure, tailored, seamless exchange of information among producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to a particular community of interest (COI). The project also provides the development of interactive and real-time computing technologies that greatly improve the usability of high performance computing for the exchange, utilization, and management of information in the enterprise. The Anticipatory Operations Intent and Response project develops the technologies for dynamic planning and execution with the accuracy, fidelity, and timeliness needed to dominate the battlespace. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nStarting in FY 2017 to improve reporting to Congress, Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo was created to capture all cyber activity that was previously performed in this program.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

This project develops and integrates decision support technologies that will enhance the commander's ability to anticipate and dominate the future battlespace by more effectively forecasting the evolution of the battlespace and by more rapidly generating options to \"virtually checkmate\" the adversary. It develops the decision aid technologies and processes to plan the use of various assets and assess their effects in the battlespace.

This secure environment will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air Operations Center (AOC) and aircraft, either en route or in theater.  This project provides secure information transmission capabilities for a persistent, global, survivable communications backbone network accessible for warfighters operating in all domains. It provides self-healing, self-configuration, anti-jam communication networking capabilities, and provides enterprise networking capabilities for agile, policy-based network management.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates flight ready systems consisting of high capacity radio frequency (RF) and optical components and architectures for next generation communications.  The Air Force also requires the ability to deliver sovereign options in cyberspace through the development and integration of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support technologies for a strategic capability of cyber dominance.  This project develops the ability to deliver cyber attack capabilities (access, stealth and persistence, cyber intelligence, and weapons delivery), cyber defense capabilities (attack detection, attack attribution, and response automation), and cyber support capability (situational awareness and war gaming.)\n\nStarting in FY 2017 cyber work previously performed within this project will be reported under Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo."

Technology development includes:  tasking information collectors, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, national intelligence sources, etc; correlating and geo-registering the collected data; exploiting the data to extract information of military significance; fusing information from multiple sources to create a digital-and-dimensional representation of the battlespace; assessing the situation; predicting adversary courses of action (COA); and archiving the results for ready use by decision-makers.  This is a dynamic, complex process that involves technologies for information exploitation, fusion, processing, storage, and retrieval, as well as technologies for machine reasoning, pattern recognition, and timeline analysis."

This project develops an agile information environment that focuses on quality of service, transformation and brokering, a federated information environment focusing the relationship among the members of the environment, a secure cross-domain information sharing capability that focuses on the security layer and inter-COI information exchange in different security domains, and a collaboration environment focusing on the information workflow layer of the enterprise.  This project will also develop:  1) a computational science and engineering capability demonstrating new models of computation; 2) novel approaches for high performance, interactive, net-centric, distributed, and embedded computing systems; and 3) the technological tools enabling affordable, large-scale, complex, software intensive systems. \n\nStarting in FY 2017 cyber work previously performed within this project will be reported under Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo."

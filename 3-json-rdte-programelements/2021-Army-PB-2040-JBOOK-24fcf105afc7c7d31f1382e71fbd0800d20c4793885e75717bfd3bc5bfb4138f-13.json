Several improvements to the existing drivetrain are necessary to increase safety margins on the tail rotor anti-torque capability. The platform overtime will continue to increase in gross weight through system upgrades and larger payloads being authorized. Missions being conducted at higher density altitudes and an increased gross weight will put the warfighters at risk of being in a loss of tail rotor authority scenario which can lead to a catastrophic situation. These product improvements would increase performance from the legacy design, decrease the maintenance burden on the warfighter, and reduce overall O&S costs. These improvements would also build the infrastructure for an improved Drive system that will be able to handle increased performance upgrades, provide a positive impact to future sustainment, support Multi-Domain Operations, and ensuring the warfighter is not placed in a catastrophic situation when it is preventable. The funding would be utilized to conduct analysis, determine feasibility of life limits, and initiate redesign plans on new components of the drive system to include hanger bearings, elastomeric mounts, Intermediate Gearbox (IGB), Tail Rotor Gearbox (TRGB), drive shafts, and other components impacted on the Tail Rotor Drive System found during testing."

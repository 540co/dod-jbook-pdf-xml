Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  \n\nEngineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.\n\nInformation and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution\/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.

Continue the integration of critical technologies focused on providing the dismounted special operator leap-ahead capabilities via innovative collaborative processes.  Continue developing unique robotic systems to reduce the load of the operator and augment human performance. Continue to develop command, control, computer, and Intelligence Technology to implement a robust, ultra-wideband communication capability.  Continue effort for field prototype system incorporating technologies likely to transition to fielded systems.  Based upon agreed technology maturity metrics, transfer successful projects into programs of record, and conduct field experimentations at various venues to facilitate technology insertion."

The purpose is to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability through the means of feasibility studies, analysis of alternatives, pre-developmental risk reduction studies, and engineering analyses. This project provides the engineering required to improve the design and performance integrity of the SOF platforms, UAV payload sensors and soldier support systems, sub-systems, equipment, and embedded computer software as they relate to the maintenance, overhaul, repair, quality assurance, modifications, materiel improvements, and service life extensions.  This project also conducts risk reduction studies, analyses, and demonstrations to support emerging, time-critical weapons and sensor enhancements."

It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media & Product Selection, Distribution & Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware\/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data."

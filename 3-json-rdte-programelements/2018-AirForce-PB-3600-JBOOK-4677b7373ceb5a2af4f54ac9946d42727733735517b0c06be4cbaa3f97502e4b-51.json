                            "val": "The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat.  The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN\/AAQ-24V] consists of missile warning sensors (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit (CIU) or control interface unit replacement (CIUR) and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles.  The number of sensors and transmitter assemblies per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft.  The system is fully automatic following system power-up.  LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98.  The system was first fielded on the C-17 aircraft.\n\nThe baseline program development is complete and consists of the small laser transmitter assembly (SLTA), ultra-violet MWS, processor, CIU and a repeater (on some aircraft) to meet the need for advanced IR countermeasures.  The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (GLTA) is an upgrade to the baseline transmitter equipment to improve reliability, enhance performance, address obsolescence issues, reduce mass and improve overall functionality.  First production GLTA delivery occurred in June 08.\n\nDevelopment of the Next Generation Missile Warning System (NexGen MWS) is complete and includes new hardware that improves capability.  Baseline equipment (ultra-violet MWS) will be retrofitted with the NexGen MWS as it becomes available.  Developmental test\/operational test (DT\/OT) was conducted in FY10 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) in FY11.  \n\nLAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats.  \n\nCurrent and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Test; Hardware, Software and Firmware Upgrades; Virtual System Integration Lab (SIL) Development; and Studies and Analysis.\n\nThreat Analysis:  Threat analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required.  Typical threat analysis activities include:  Threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system, and the evaluation\/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to IRCM.  \n\nModeling, Simulation, and Emulation Testing:  Modeling, simulation, and emulation activities verify and validate the information obtained from the threat analysis activities.  These activities include:  Evaluation of infrared countermeasures (IRCM) techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code; validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware; evaluating system effectiveness; performing platform integration support tests; and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.  \n\nHardware, Software, and Firmware Upgrades:  Includes changes of any kind to any LAIRCM hardware components\/support equipment with the purpose of adding capability, features, and enhancements which do not presently exist to ensure the LAIRCM system remains viable against current and emerging threats.  \n    -----Hardware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, test and produce new capabilities, features, and enhancements, and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM hardware with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist.  \n    -----Software upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the new or modified code that result in new capabilities, features, and enhancements and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM software with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist.  Software upgrades can occur in any of the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) Operation Flight Programs as well as any of the software residing in other LAIRCM-associated components including those systems which support development and test or the LAIRCM support equipment.  \n    -----Firmware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the upgrades and those changes resulting from hardware and software updates\/modifications as well as firmware upgrades which add new features.\n\nVirtual SIL Development:  Incrementally design, develop, integrate, and test software code and purchase associated infrastructure (i.e., computers, servers, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, etc.) necessary to develop and implement a virtual SIL providing a critical capability for testing the LAIRCM system to ensure continued effectiveness against current and emerging threats.       \n\nStudies and Analysis:  Includes logistics, programmatic, and engineering studies and analysis activities to ensure continued system viability and sustainability and compliance with acquisition directives.  These activities may include the evaluation of low cost\/high payback opportunities to reduce software development\/implementation cost, enhance production efficiency, and improve life cycle costs through increased reliability and reduced repair and return cost.\n\nProgram management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to, contract services and government costs.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

NDEP is executed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)).  NDEP\u2019s portfolio includes workforce development programs, such as the Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program; Military family programs, such as the Military Child Pilot Program (MCPP); STEM Education and Outreach; and the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP).  These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) increasing STEM proficiency in the Nation by enabling an increased capacity to address ever-changing future defense workforce needs; (2) shaping the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through programs and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts and coordinating STEM efforts in alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) identifying approaches for innovative solutions in support of the Nation's current and future defense challenges.\n\nThe NDEP aligns to the National Defense Strategy and the DoD science and technology (S&T) priorities.  The program is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan, and the DoD Agency Strategic Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation practices as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 21 STEM academic disciplines and hires the students, upon graduation, into DoD's workforce.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 2,800 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 2,000 students have completed their academic pursuit and transitioned into DoD employment.  Approximately 1,200 have completed their service commitment to the Department.  SMART ensures the Department has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission.\n\nThe MCPP enhances the preparation of dependents of members of the Armed Forces for careers in STEM and provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, authorized the establishment of this Pilot Program.\n\nSTEM Education and Outreach fosters activities to support and cultivate STEM talent with minds for innovation, diversity of thought, and the technical agility to sustain the Department\u2019s competitive edge.  In order to build a necessary workforce that brings in an expansion of ideas to solve national defense needs and challenges, the DoD recognizes the need for increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.  Initiatives include investing, promoting, and participating in national-level STEM programs and efforts, as well as providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the Nation.\n\nThe DoD is constantly looking for innovative scientific and technological solutions to address current and future military requirements.  The MEEP will enhance existing or establish new education programs that support manufacturing engineering."

Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to the Department on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  Approximately 1,200 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD Service commitment, of which 70 percent of those participants are still employed by DoD.\n\nOversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in relevant hands-on research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.\n\nSince FY 2005, approximately 2,800 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 190 sponsoring facilities.  As of October 2018, approximately 2,000 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components."

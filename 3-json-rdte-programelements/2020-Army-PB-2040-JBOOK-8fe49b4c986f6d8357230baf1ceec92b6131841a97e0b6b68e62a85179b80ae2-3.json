Broadly, the work in this PE falls into the categories of Collaborative Technology Alliances \/ Collaborative Research Alliances (CTAs\/CRAs), University Centers of Excellence (COE), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), Army-sponsored educational outreach, and Army investments at international academic and industrial partners. The Army formed CTAs to leverage large investments by the commercial sector in basic research areas that are of great interest to the Army. CTAs are industry-led partnerships between industry, academia, and the Army Futures Command to incorporate the practicality of industry, the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge from universities, and Army scientists to shape, mature, and transition technology relevant to the Army mission. CRAs are academia-led partnerships, which leverage the cutting-edge innovation found in the academic environment. The COEs focus on expanding the frontiers of knowledge in research areas where the Army has enduring needs, and couples state-of-the-art research programs at academic institutions with broad-based graduate education programs to increase the supply of scientists and engineers in automotive and rotary wing technology. Also included are Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) and activities to stimulate interest in science, math, and technology among middle and high school students. This PE includes support for basic research at three Army UARCs, which have been created to exploit opportunities to advance new capabilities through a sustained long- term multidisciplinary effort. The Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies focuses on Soldier protection by emphasizing revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability. The Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies focuses on enabling network centric-technologies, and broadening the Army's use of biotechnology for the development of bio-inspired materials, sensors, and information processing. The Institute for Creative Technologies is a partnership with academia and the entertainment and gaming industries to leverage innovative research and concepts for training and simulation. Examples of specific research of mutual interest to the entertainment industry and the Army are technologies for realistic immersion in synthetic environments, networked simulation, standards for interoperability, and tools for creating simulated environments. This PE also includes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institution (HBCU\/MI) Centers of Excellence that address critical research areas for Army Transformation.\n\nFY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

CTAs and CRAs are partnerships between Army laboratories and centers, private industry, and academia that focus on the rapid transition of innovative technologies to the Warfighter to enable the Army's Future Force. The collaboration between industry, academia and the government is a key element of the alliance concept as each member brings with it a distinctly different approach to research. Academia are known for its cutting-edge innovation; the industrial partners are able to leverage existing research results for transition and to deal with technology bottlenecks; the Army Futures Command researchers keep the program oriented toward solving complex Army technology problems. This approach enables an Alliance to bring together world class research and development talent and focus it on Army-specific technology objectives for application to Army needs. The topics covered by CRAs and CTAs include cyber security, the internet of battlefield things, distributed and collaborative intelligent systems technology, neuroergonomics and neuroscience, advanced materials, exploitation of quantum effects, and machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The nine ITCs located in North America, South America, Asia, and Europe support the Army's goals of providing the best technology in the world to our Warfighters by leveraging the Science and Technology (S&T) investments of our international partners. The ITCs perform identification and evaluation of international technology programs to assess their potential impact on the Army's S&T investment strategy. ITC 'technology finds' are submitted to various Army S&T organizations for evaluation and consideration for further research and development. Highly promising research will be awarded seed funding by the ITC through a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. The FTAS program also builds upon the technology finds submitted by the ITCs. In some cases the find is truly unique and may well meet an Army requirement or potentially support ongoing Army S&T investments. In such cases, the FTAS program can provide initial resources (seed money) to determine the appropriateness of these technology areas identified as having potential relevance to the Army. These efforts will provide information useful in making early assessments of the technology's potential contributions to the Army's S&T strategy.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This CRA consists of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments.  This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of cyber security and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network.  The three aspects of cyber that are addressed are: 1) vulnerabilities and risks of cyber networks to malicious activities, 2) anticipating, detecting, and analyzing malicious activities, and 3) agile cyber maneuver to thwart and defeat malicious activities.  Overarching goals of cyber security are to significantly decrease the adversary's return on investment when considering cyber attack on Army networks, and minimizing the impact on (Army) network performance related to implementing cyber security.  The CRA research creates a framework that effectively integrates the knowledge of cyber assets and potential adversary capabilities and approaches, and provides defense mechanisms that dynamically adjust to changes related to mission, assets, vulnerability state, and defense mechanisms.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology) \/ Project H92 (Communications Technology). \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Escalating levels of complexity and uncertainty on the current and future battlefield present conditions which have never existed before now.  Solution strategies and approaches must be developed or tailored.  The emerging field of neuroergonomics, which seeks to understand the brain at work and to leverage that understanding to optimize system design, offers tremendous potential for providing the solutions needed to meet the needs of Army forces in the future.  This CTA addresses the solution strategies and approaches needed to design systems to fully exploit investments in revolutionary technological advances in areas such as robotics, microelectronics, and computer and network information systems.  These technologies present significant opportunities to enhance Army mission capabilities, but impose significant burdens on the human brain, which will ultimately limit Soldier-system effectiveness, sustainability, and survivability.  The technical barriers associated with this project include: immature knowledge base to guide the neuroergonomic approach to human-system integration; inadequate capabilities to sense and extract information about brain activity in dynamic, operational environments; lack of valid measures to robustly and uniquely characterize operationally-relevant cognitive performance; lack of techniques for integrating advanced understandings of brain activity into systems designs, including real-time use of measures of cognitive behavior as system inputs and the capability to account for individual differences in maximizing Soldier-system performance.  This CTA conducts an intensive and accelerated program to formulate, validate, and transition basic research findings through multi-dimensional approaches focused in three areas: understanding fundamental principles underlying Soldier neurocognitive performance in operational environments, advancing computational approaches for the analysis and interpretation of neural functioning, and fundamental advancement in neurotechnologies that enhance Soldier-system interactions and performance. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The CRA links a broad range of government technology agencies, as well as industrial and academic partners with the Army Futures Command. The DCIST CRA focuses on systems with a large number of heterogeneous intelligent agents, including Soldiers that can be distributed over large areas and are required to move through contested environments and against peer capabilities at op-tempo. To meet these goals innovative research is performed in three main technical areas: distributed intelligence, large heterogeneous group control, and adaptive and resilient behaviors. The payoff to the warfighter will be extended reach, situational awareness, and operational effectiveness against dynamic threats in contested environments, and technical and operational superiority through intelligent, resilient and collaborative behaviors of Soldiers and intelligent systems. The CRA facilitates the exchange of people among the collaborating organizations to provide cross-organizational perspectives on basic research challenges, and to make available to the Alliance state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The CRA will comprise academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of phenomena of Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems in tactically relevant environments. The CRA will facilitate collaboration across organizations to provide multi-disciplinary perspectives on basic research challenges, as well as the use of state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations. This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of pervasive and converged cyber- physical complex information systems and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the information-theoretic and human elements of Army IoBT interactions. The three aspects of the emergent Internet of Battlefield Things topical areas addressed are: 1) dynamic discovery and adaptation of cyber- physical devices, networks, and information sources, 2) resilient re-purposing and re-tasking of devices and information capabilities, and 3) algorithmic, distributed and centralized information-stream processing. Overarching goals of the basic research on Army IoBT are to investigate foundational cross-cutting theories and methods leading towards a science of heterogeneous, self-adapting, complex cyber-physical systems. This research will lead to optimized real-time adversarial situation estimates in information-enabled warfare and greatly enhance the speed and precision for complex military operations involving converged sensing, communications, and resilient actuation.\n\nWork in this Project builds fundamental knowledge for and accelerates the transition of communications and networks technology to PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The ICB was established as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to support leveraging biotechnology for: advanced sensors; new electronic, magnetic, and optical materials; and information processing and bioinspired network analysis. The objective is to perform sustained multidisciplinary basic research supporting technology to provide the Army with biomolecular sensor platforms with unprecedented sensitivity, reliability, and durability; higher-order arrays of functional electronic and optoelectronic components capable of self-assembly and with multi-functions; and new biological means to process, integrate, and network information.  These sensor platforms will incorporate proteomics (large scale study of proteins) technology, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence identification and detection tools, and the capability for recognition of viral pathogens.  A second ICB objective is to educate and train outstanding students and post-doctoral researchers in revolutionary areas of science to support Army Transformation.  The ICB has many industrial partners, such as International Business Machine (IBM) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), and has strong collaborations with Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Sandia National Laboratories, the Army's Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, the Institute for Creative Technologies, and Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) laboratories.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The ITCs perform identification and evaluation of international technology programs to assess their potential impact on the Army's S&T investment strategy.  ITC 'technology finds' are submitted to various Army S&T organizations for evaluation and consideration for further research and development.  Highly promising research will be awarded seed funding by the ITC through a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.  The FTAS program also builds upon the \"technology finds\" submitted by the ITCs.  In some cases the technology is truly unique and may well meet an Army requirement or potentially support ongoing Army S&T investments.  In such cases, the FTAS program can provide initial resources (seed money) to determine the appropriateness of these technology areas identified as having potential relevance to the Army.  These efforts will provide information useful in making early assessments of the technology's potential contributions to the Army's S&T strategy.  \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The ICT was established as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to support Army training and readiness through research into simulation, mixed and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and learning sciences. ICT applies the results of this research and proves its value in Army relevant applications such as training, mission rehearsal, leadership development, cultural awareness, negotiation, health and medical, and distance learning.  The ICT actively performs research and engages industry and academic institutions internationally to incorporate the latest research results and hardware and software into its research program and application development and exploit dual-use technology. The ICT serves as a means for the military to learn about, benefit from, and facilitate the transfer of applicable technologies into military systems.  In addition the ICT works with creative talent from the entertainment industry to advance and leverage techniques and capabilities and adapt concepts of story and character to increase the degree of participant immersion in synthetic environments in order to improve the realism and usefulness of these experiences.  In developing a true synthesis of the creativity, research, technology, and capability of industry and the research and development community, the ICT is revolutionizing capabilities for the Army by making it more effective in terms of cost, time, range of experiences and the quality of the result and by producing research and applications that will benefit the Army of the 21st century. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The ISN emphasizes revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The ISN works in close collaboration with the United States (US) Army Futures Command as well as several major industrial partners, including Raytheon and DuPont, in pursuit of its goals.  This Project emphasizes revolutionary materials research toward an advanced uniform concept.  The future uniform will integrate a wide range of functionality, including ballistic protection, responsive passive cooling and insulating, screening of chemical and biological agents, biomedical monitoring, performance enhancement, and extremities protection.  The objective is to lighten the Soldier's load through system integration and multifunctional devices while increasing survivability.  The new technologies will be compatible with other Soldier requirements, including Soldier performance, limited power generation, integrated sensors, communication and display technologies, weapons systems, and expected extremes of temperature, humidity, storage lifetimes, damage, and spoilage. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The focus is on enhancing distributed, secure, and flexible decision-making to improve coalition operations, and developing the scientific foundations for complex and dynamic networked systems-of-systems to support the complex human, social, and technical interactions anticipated in future coalition operations with the emphasis on integration of multiple technical disciplines in an international arena. The Army Futures Command and the UK Ministry of Defense (MOD) established the jointly funded and managed US and UK consortium, known as the International Technology Alliance (ITA) on Network and Information Sciences, in FY06. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The Center for Distributed Quantum Information will study and demonstrate both the physical backbone and network layer for a robust quantum information network that will provide secure and tamper-proof communications and exponentially greater information processing capabilities for the future Army.  The Center for Distributed Quantum Information will perform collaborative research with Army in-house scientists and engineers to help accelerate the transition of the research.  In addition to providing the required expertise and critical mass to the effort, the  consortium will also bring together a broad but unified multi-disciplinary research team needed to accelerate progress in the field of quantum information sciences. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

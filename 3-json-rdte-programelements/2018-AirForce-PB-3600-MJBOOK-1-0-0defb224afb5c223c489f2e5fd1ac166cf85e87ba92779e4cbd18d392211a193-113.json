Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.   These restoration\/modernization funds support the following Air Force test organizations and their associated test and evaluation facilities, including:  remote locations, 704th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 96th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC)] at Arnold AFB, TN, the 412th TW at Edwards AFB, CA, 704 TG Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, AEDC's Hypersonic Wind Tunnel 9 at White Oak, MD, and AEDC's National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, CA.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

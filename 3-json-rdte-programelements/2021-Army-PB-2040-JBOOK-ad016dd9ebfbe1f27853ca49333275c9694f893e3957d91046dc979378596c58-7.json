            "val": "This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network, LOE 2 - Common Operating Environment and LOE 4 - Command posts. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nProject 323, the Common Hardware Systems (CHS), is an ACAT III program and is a mandated Army Strategic Source that acquires and sustains highly flexible, cost effective, and simplified non developmental C5ISR solutions that integrates the latest and emerging commercial technology onto the Converged Mission Command Network. This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 2, Common Operating Environment. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy. CHS provides technical support, environmental and survivability testing, system design, end of life\/configuration management, and strengthens cybersecurity\/supply chain risk management across Army tactical programs to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the computing infrastructure. CHS continuously analyzes and tracks hardware from cradle-to-grave, from emerging technology until end-of-life. CHS conducts hardware evaluations that facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across numerous Army programs and agencies including: Mission Command; Tactical Network; Tactical Radios; Distributed Common Ground Station Army; Aviation Systems; Counter Rocket, Artillery, Mortar; Communication Electronics Command; Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC), among others. CHS rapidly procures common hardware configurations across the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), Common Operating Environment (COE), the sustainment community, and tactical programs that enables the continuous modernization in support of all four Network Modernization Lines of Effort and Network Cross Functional Team (CFT) requirements. CHS logistical services include worldwide 72 hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, tailorable supply chain and cybersecurity measures, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements. CHS supports better buying power initiatives by creating efficiencies through economies of scale, price breaks, streamlined processes, reduced cycle times, and centralized contracting.\n \nProject C29, the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF), is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of system verification\/validation checkout, testing, and configuration management for the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. The Centralized Technical Support Facility (CTSF) funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort LOE 1B Network Enabling Functions.\n\nProject C34, the Army Tac C2 Sys Eng project funds the PEO Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) the System-of-Systems engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts.  The system engineering efforts are to facilitate the overall network interoperability of all the various programs that must be able to seamlessly connect together while addressing their individual distinct requirements.  Efforts address continuing evolution of the network within the PEO C3T portfolio of technology across capability enhancement packages, in line with the Network CFT capability set strategy, to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solution. \n\nProject EJ4, the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), is one of the computing environments under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative, a major Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort of the Network Cross-Functional Team (N-CFT). CPCE provides a common software infrastructure framework (common interface, data, and services) upon which future Warfighter capabilities can be built. CPCE development efforts initially target Movement and Maneuver capability development at tactical echelons that span from Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to Battalion level. The CPCE will be the central computing environment developed to support command posts and combat operations, and will be interoperable with Mounted and Mobile\/Handheld systems.\n\nProject EJ5, the Mounted Computing Environment (MCE), is one of the six computing environments (CEs) formalized by the AAE under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative. MCE standardizes end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications while leveraging existing hardware under the Joint Battle Command - Platform program. Requirements for the MCE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the approved Mounted Computing Environment Requirements Definition Package (RDP). The MCE will provide incremental improvements with additional application capabilities over time, and will be interoperable with Command Post and Mobile\/Handheld systems.\n\n\nProject EJ6, Tactical Enhancement supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Sight and beyond line of sight radio systems. In addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current WIN-T SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti- jam capability and resiliency to WIN-T Program of Record satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on WIN-T satellite modems.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY 2028\/2029). The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events. \n \nProject EK9, Tactical Networks Operational Management (TNOM)'s purpose is to create Unified Network Operations (UNO).  UNO is a software based, integrated NetOps capability being developed, as a rapid prototype - proceeding under Section 804, mid-tier acquisition (MTA) authority granted by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE)'s 14 May 2019 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM). Enabling common planning, configuration, monitoring, provisioning, management, and defense of the Network, UNO configures and integrates tactical and enterprise networks to allow delivery of information and communications among Soldiers at all echelons utilizing network resources prioritized according to the Commander's intent. In developing UNO, TNOM follows the Army's development operations (DevOps) approach - creating NetOps prototypes, gaining user feedback, making adjustments and ultimately delivering enhanced capabilities to the operational force in the shortest time possible. UNO development incorporates solutions available in industry and through government agencies - assessing them in an adapt and buy approach informed by experimentation, demonstration, and modernization.\n\nProject EQ8, Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment, supports the Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program.  The program leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations.  The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader.  \n\nProject ER9, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2), fields mobile Command Post nodes by integrating mission command solutions to enhance the survivability and mobility of command post formations.  CPI2 will replace selected elements of the legacy command post to provide improved expeditionary capability, survivability, agility, and scalability for command post formations at all echelons. By integrating mission command warfighting functions on to formation appropriate vehicle platforms, a dispersed command post construct will enable the battle staff to blend in with the overall maneuver formation while giving the commander the ability to synchronize the close fight on the move.  \n\nProject EW3, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR) funding line supports the Army Network Plan Framework objective to deliver a Standards Based Network Architecture. This will enable modernizing the Mission Command Network through the coordination of a common set of network operations tools and infrastructure development supporting the unit communication staff's ability to conduct Network Planning, Network Provisioning and Network Management. Network Planning efforts include the development of an integrated planning tool suite to improve Signal Soldiers ability to plan and develop configurations for upcoming operations and deployments. Network Provisioning efforts include development of tools and technology that provide a means to deliver configurations developed during the Network Planning with little to no manual involvement by the Soldier. Network Management efforts replace stove-piped management systems and replaces them with integrated tools that provide a consolidated, as well as detailed, view of the network and its components."

The Central Technical Support Facility's (CTSF) directed mission is to perform Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) testing and configuration management for all operational through tactical level Command, Computing, Control, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) systems (individual, family, and system of systems), applications, and hardware prior to release to the field.  The CTSF accomplishes this through the enforcement of a standards based architecture while supporting the development and implementation of an integrated computing infrastructure and a converged network.  The CTSF provides validated test data to the Department of the Army and Joint agencies to accredit interoperability certifications. The distributed test environment of the CTSF is accomplished through the Federation of Net-centric Sites (FaNS) construct. This FaNS construct addresses distributed integration development and testing using the core infrastructure of the CTSF to harness Army and Joint expertise\/resources. Through these federated resources, the CTSF executes or supports interoperability development, integration and certification testing of the systems and system of systems in the Warfighter Mission Area, to include Network Evaluation spinouts, as they become part of the Army's LandWarNet. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan."

Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nThe Common Operating Environment (COE) is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enables secure and interoperable applications to be developed and executed rapidly across a variety of computing environments (i.e., server(s), client, mobile, sensors, and platform).  The Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) is one of the six computing environments under the COE, which provides the movement and maneuver applications, common computing services such as Cyber tools and e-mail, and includes tactical server capabilities within Command Posts at all echelons (Battalion to Army Service Component Commander).\n\nTo mitigate potential misalignments with the requirements community, the program increment designations will align with validated requirement documents. Accordingly, the former Increment 2 is now designated as Increment 1 to align with Capability Drop 1. Increment 1, which was approved via Full Deployment Decision in July 2019 and currently fielded, is now designated Increment 0. CPCE Increment 0 requirements are detailed in the Minimum Essential Capabilities document.  \n\nThe CPCE implements an integrated, interoperable, cyber-secure, cost-effective software infrastructure that serves as the host for a unified set of multiple warfighting functional applications within the command post. This software infrastructure will be central to the COE, allowing interoperability between command posts, mounted platforms, and dismounted handheld devices while supporting collaboration using a common picture with Joint and Unified Action partners. CPCE will provide a core software infrastructure including a common operating picture (COP) tool, common look and feel (user interface), common data strategy, interoperable tactical messaging\/chat, and essential movement and maneuver capabilities. CPCE software infrastructure and applications will reside on Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) hardware and previously fielded BCCS\/TSI servers. The CPCE eliminates \"stove-piped\" legacy systems, duplicative or redundant implementations, simplifies future application development efforts, and enhances interoperability and data sharing across multiple echelons.  \n\nCPCE employs an agile development approach, in two year increments, with capabilities being integrated to support the Army IS COE effort. Increment 0 includes core infrastructure and initial movement and maneuver capabilities.  Increment 1 of the program will meet the requirements of the CPCE Requirements Definition Package and Capability Drop 1, and bring enhancements to Increment 0 and initial system convergence. Increment 2 will bring additional warfighting function capabilities and enhancements to existing capability.  \n\nFY 2021 funding will support the consolidation, adjudication, and codification of specific technical requirements for CPCE Increment 1 with focus on the support of legacy system infrastructure requirements and begin requirements planning and design phase of CPCE Increment 2.  These efforts will extend the capabilities of the Increment 0 baseline to include infrastructure modification\/improvement to facilitate convergence of legacy Mission Command system capabilities, CPCE Capability Drop 1 (CD1) requirements, Cross-Cutting Capabilities (CCC) enhancements and additional Movement and Maneuver capabilities."

For development of additional capabilities to be integrated into the COTS system, CPCE follows the Agile development approach (Epics, Iterations, and Sprints) that allows capabilities to be engineered, developed and tested rapidly. The Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Armaments Center Weapons and Software Engineering Center (WSEC) and the Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Software Engineering Center (SEC) are prime Government partners in system development.  Commercial suppliers are assigned efforts through GSA Mission Command Engineering Services vehicles and Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contracts.\n\nHardware (server) platforms are COTS and procured under the Tactical Services Infrastructure (TSI) funding line through existing vehicles from GSA, Common Hardware Systems (CHS) and the Army Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS).\n\nCPCE Inc 0 brings the core software infrastructure and initial movement and maneuver capabilities. Inc 1 will meet the requirements of the CPCE Requirements Definition Package and Capability Drop 1, and focuses on enhancements to Inc 0, and enabling legacy system convergence. Inc 2 will bring additional warfighting function capabilities and enhancements to existing capability.  \n\nThe Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the TSI Acquisition Strategy on 17 May 2019 and issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) to field CPCE Increment 0 capability on the TSI.  CPCE Inc 0 underwent Initial Operational Test & Evaluation in Nov 2018 and conditional authority to field the capability was granted on 15 Jul 19.  The CPCE Inc 1 Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed on 9 Sep 2019 authorizing entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase of the acquisition lifecycle."

Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nThe Common Operating Environment (COE) is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enables secure and interoperable applications to be developed and executed rapidly across a variety of computing environments (i.e., server(s), client, mobile, sensors, and platform). The Mounted Computing Environment (MCE) is one of six computing environments under the COE, which provides standardization of end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new war-fighting applications while leveraging existing hardware under the Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) program.\n\nThe MCE supports LOE 2 by utilizing:\n- Interoperable data, message, and waveforms\n- Sensors and applications that enable operations across domains\n- Integration with Joint C5ISR and strike capabilities\n- Increased interoperability with the Command Post Computing Environment and Mobile Handheld Computing Environment \n\nRequirements for the MCE are established in the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC)-approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the Mounted Computing Environment Requirements Definition Package (RDP). \n\nMCE's Materiel Development Decision (MDD) is scheduled for 2QFY20.\n\nMCE employs a Developmental Operations (DevOps) process to incrementally develop capability over time to satisfy requirements and meet fielding decisions. FY 2021 funding will continue DevOps activities to incorporate new capability and enhancements based on user feedback, as well as lay the groundwork to support migration of third-party applications onto the MCE software baseline. Additionally, FY 2021 funding provides for initial test instrumentation and risk reduction events\/preparation to support a v3.1 Operational Test (OT) and Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) scheduled for 1QFY22.\n\nMCE's RDT&E resources are used to improve and add software applications while JBC-P RDT&E is used to improve JBC-P hardware, network performance and add network resiliency."

It is standards based, protected and supports incremental improvements with additional application capabilities over time. MCE will leverage the existing JBC-P hardware and network, and be deployed as a software upgrade to replace the legacy JBC-P software. It will support a common look and feel and is part of the solution enabling leaders to lead and fight their formations from anywhere they choose.\n\nMCE is utilizing an incremental development approach, leveraging DevOps, to ensure capability satisfies requirements and addresses Warfighter feedback. This agile development process injects enhancements into the baseline software, making it easier to incorporate technological advances. The project office conducts commercial software assessments to determine applicability and suitability for inclusion in the MCE baseline.\n\nSoftware development increments and fielding decisions will be implemented with an agile 2 year capability set tech insertion construct. Software development will be manageable, tailorable, and scalable in the Capability Assessment Package (CAP) format to enable better management of capability delivery. MCE's v3.1 First Unit Equipped (FUE) is scheduled for 4QFY22; subsequent SW versions are planned to implement over-the-air updates reducing the sustainment footprint necessary to deploy and maintain multiple software baselines.\n\nMCE's Materiel Development Decision (MDD) is scheduled for 2QFY20."

TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Sight and beyond line of sight radio systems. \n\nIn addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current Tactical Network SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti- jam capability and resiliency to Tactical Network satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on Tactical Network satellite modems.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY 2028\/2029). The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events. \n\nSIGMOD Capabilities: \n\nTROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System.  TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth.\n\nFY 2021: Funds support TROPO Initial Operational Test & Evaluation efforts to support Full Rate Production Decision in FY 2022"

UNO is a software centric, integrated NetOps capability being developed, as a rapid prototype - proceeding under Section 804, mid-tier acquisition (MTA) authority granted by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE)'s 14 May 2019 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM). Enabling common planning, configuration, monitoring, provisioning, management, and defense of the Network, UNO configures and integrates tactical and enterprise networks to allow delivery of information and communications among Soldiers at all echelons utilizing network resources prioritized according to the Commander's intent. In developing UNO, TNOM follows the Army's development operations (DevOps) approach - creating Network Operations (NetOps) prototypes, gaining user feedback, making adjustments and ultimately delivering enhanced capabilities to the operational force in the shortest time possible. UNO development incorporates solutions available in industry and through government agencies - assessing them in an adapt-and-buy approach informed by experimentation, demonstration, and modernization.\n\nFY 2021 funding supports MTA (Section 804) rapid prototyping efforts of UNO v1.0 via NetOps capabilities that build upon current efforts, efforts that align with Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) guidance to provide delivery of a simplified NetOps capabilities across the tactical network, and include emerging capability requirements stemming from Network Cross-Functional Team (CFT) initiatives and directed requirements. UNO will also support the delivery of integrated capabilities to plan, install, operate, maintain, and secure the Army's end-to-end network in support of the commander's mission priorities. Army's approved requirements for UNO are found in the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) Abbreviated - Capability Definition Document (A-CDD) dated 26 June 2019."

The Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment (M\/HHCE) is one of the six computing environments under the COE, which provides the standards for all Army hand held applications enabling the use of common End User Devices by Soldiers, thereby eliminating redundant devices and reducing the Soldiers' load.\n\nThe M\/HHCE is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 (Unified Network). M\/HHCE also supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 2 (Common Operating Environment).  These efforts are aligned to the Army's Tactical Network Capability Set development and fielding plans by utilizing (1) interoperable data, message, and waveforms, (2) sensors and applications that enable operations across domains and (3) integration with Joint C4ISR and strike capabilities. Nett Warrior (NW) and Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) are the instantiation of the M\/HHCE and comply with the technical standards documented by the M\/HHCE and provide the dismounted common computational platform for other products relevant to dismounted Soldiers. Through compliance with the M\/HHCE, software applications from other programs are integrated with the NW and IVAS systems, reducing the need for duplicate hardware resulting in reduced Soldier Load. NW leverages commercial smart phone devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness capability for use during combat operations. NW applied feedback from conventional and Special Operations units to procure and implement Secret and Secure But Unclassified (SBU) networking equipment for BCTs and the Security Force Assistance Brigades to enable faster, more flexible Mission Command data exchanges with Joint and Coalition forces while maintaining the existing integrated mission command capability with Mounted CE (e.g., JBCP) system. NW uses Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Non Developmental (NDI) communications equipment to create a robust and flexible Integrated Tactical Network that enables faster and more accurate decision making in fights at the tactical level.\n\nRequirements for the M\/HH CE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD), the M\/HHCE Requirements Definition Package (RDP), and the NW Capability Development Document in lieu of Capability Production Document.  This project is in the Army's Top 100 Modernization efforts."

Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures.  The Nett Warrior (NW) program provides situational awareness and mission command to dismounted combat leaders through a secure commercial smart device, power source, cables and the Integrated Tactical Network.  NW funds development and evaluation of new technology and software integration through a combination of competitively awarded contracts.  Various existing follow on procurement contracts are utilized to procure a combination of COTs and GOTs NW equipment to include supporting services.  NW program completed LRIP\/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&E under DOT&E oversight in 4QFY14- 1QFY15. This IOT&E event led to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision in FY17. Now in production, NW seeks operational feedback and uses the DevOps process to identify and implement new capabilities.  M\/HHCE standards are updated annually under the M\/HHCE governance process."

Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nProgram will implement capabilities in a two increment approach.  Increment 1 will implement prototype capabilities as identified in signed Directed Requirement and Increment 2 will execute the requirements identified in Capability Development Document (CDD) due for review\/approval in 2QFY20.  These capabilities will enable the Army to employ command posts across the operational spectrum, from early entry to major combat operations that will resolve current command post issues with set up and tear down, survivability, mobility, suitability and footprint. \n\nThe Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2) program addresses the requirements for more mobile, scalable, interoperable, and agile command posts. Currently fielded command posts are deemed too large and take too long to setup and teardown making them vulnerable to near peer detection and targeting technologies. By integrating mission command warfighting functions on to formation appropriate vehicle platforms, a dispersed command post construct will enable the battle staff to blend in with the overall maneuver formation while giving the commander the ability to synchronize the close fight on the move. This dispersed mobile command post consists of Mission Command Platforms (MCPs) and Command Post Support Vehicles (CPSVs). The MCP is a formation appropriate vehicle that provides digital workstations for all mission command warfighting functions. The CPSV is the hub of the dispersed command post; it hosts mission command servers, radios, local area network components and a secure wireless capability. Specific to CORPS\/DIV, CPI2 will provide a Mobile Command Group (MCG) consisting of formation appropriate platforms that supports Corps\/Div Commanders\/Staff with high priority functions while on the move.  \n\nFY 2021 initiates Inc 2 portion of the program to address design engineering and prototype development for formation-appropriate MCPs, MCGs, and CPSVs and includes design changes to platform shelters as required based on results of experimentation.  Funds will also support integration and testing for Increment 1 with 2 BCT's and a Division Main to obtain user feedback to drive future requirements.  Includes funding for engineering changes, test and training, CPI2 program management."

Using the buy, try, assess, and decide acquisition model which leverages user experimentation to inform follow-on program requirements.  Increment 1 will prototype and integrate available commercial off the shelf (COTS) as well as  government programs of record (PORs) equipment that provide mission command and communications functions within the command post. Increment 2 will execute requirements per the CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD) to replace designated legacy command post systems at Corps, Division, Brigade combat Team's, their subordinate Battalion (BN) formations and select Multi-functional Support Brigades (MFSB).  \n\nIncrement 1 will work with the government and with industry to capitalize on their experiences with mobile Command Posts to perform risk reduction events on experimental solutions for the Command Post Support Vehicle and Mission Command Platform as outlined in the Command Post Directed Requirement (DR). \n\nCPI2 Inc 1 will develop the BCT #1 through experimentation conducted with Combat Capabilities Development Center (CCDC) via a Functional Support Agreement (FSA) for  BCT #1.  CPI2 will leverage industry advancements and innovation using full and open competition with the C5SIR Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to design and prototype the MCP\/CPSV for the BCT #2.  CPI2 will experiment at the Division main executing an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  CPI2 will deliver a platform based Mobile Command Group (MCG) to 1 Division via an FSA with Project Manager (PM) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT).  The integration efforts will culminate with test events on all prototype designs, leading to a Milestone in FY21 to select the Command Post (CP) solution set for fielding the remaining 3 BCTs and 1 MCG to a Corps identified in the CP DR.\n\nThe CPI2 CDD specifies Increment 2 requirements and is scheduled for AROC review\/approval on 7 Feb 2020.  A Milestone B in 3QFY20 for Inc 2 will authorize RDTE efforts to focus on design\/development of unit appropriate platforms which will be executed via FSA with platform Program of Record (POR) contracts.  A Milestone C for Increment 2 in FY23 will initiate the fielding of CPI2 to designated Army units.  Future editions of the CDD will incorporate feedback based on prototype experimentation, user feedback and advances in technology.  CPI2 plans to compete a contract with industry for the design, engineering, test and production of the CDD solution for CPI2.  Additionally, CPI2 will leverage existing contracts managed by Joint Program Office Light Tactical Vehicle (JPO JLTV), Product Manager (PdM) Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and PM SBCT for integration efforts associated with their respective platforms.  This will encompass CPI2 variants at designated Corps, Division, Brigade, Battalion and select Multi-Functional Support Brigades."

This will enable the modernization of the Mission Command Network through the coordination of a common set of network operations tools and infrastructure development supporting the unit communication staff's ability to conduct Network Planning, Network Provisioning and Network Management.  Network Planning includes the development of an integrated planning tool suite to improve Signal Soldiers ability to plan and develop configurations for upcoming operations and deployments. Network Provisioning includes the development of tools and technology that provide a means to deliver configurations developed during the Network Planning with little to no manual involvement by the Soldier.  Network Management results in the replacement of stove-piped management systems and with integrated tools that provide a consolidated, as well as detailed, view of the network and its components.\n\nFY 2021 UTR funding will be used to continue development of network components that support centralized data, security, and information exchanges; continue development of Network Planning functions to plan the tactical network to continue development of Radio Planning capabilities in order to plan and create configuration files for emerging ITN radios and waveforms; continue development of network device and radio provisioning systems and continue the development of a network manager that monitors and displays network health status, performance, location and security to local operator."

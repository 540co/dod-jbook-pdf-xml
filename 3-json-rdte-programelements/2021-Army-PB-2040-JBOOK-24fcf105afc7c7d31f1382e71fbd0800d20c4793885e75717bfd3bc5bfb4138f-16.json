            "val": "DT2 \/ Non-MIP Biometrics - Biometrics Enabling Capability 0 (BEC 0), aka DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS), is an Army information technology system supporting identity superiority by providing the critical core capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected threat actors in Multi Domain Operations (MDO) to include peer adversaries, terrorists and third country nationals.  BEC 0 is an Army Program of Record and DoD's only authoritative biometric repository, providing 24\/7 operational support for the Warfighter and interagency partners to decide and act in near-real time with timely identification and identity verification of known or suspected threat actors across the full range of military operations.  DoD ABIS enables actionable intelligence supporting offensive operations and preventing espionage, sabotage, terrorist operations and other coercive actions against US forces and partner nations.  DoD ABIS enables the Army, all other DOD components, Interagency and International Partners to effectively impede adversary's ability to conceal their identity and intentions.  DoD ABIS supports all three objectives of the National Defense Strategy to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation, and improve business practices.\n\nThe Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA), under the Provost Marshal General, fulfills the Secretary of the Army's Executive Agent (EA) responsibilities for\nall DoD forensics and biometrics activities.  In addition, DFBA is the proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) and\ninformation management support throughout the Armed Services and DoD.  DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvement and implementation of\nefficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities\nthat contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational\neffectiveness on the battlefield.  The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific\nrequirements identified by combat developers.\n\nJustification:\n\nFY 2021 RDT&E funding in DT2 is $0. BEC 0 is in sustainment.  \n \nFY 2021 funding in the amount of $1.325 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility,\nand that DFBA objectives and requirements are met.  DFBA supports the conduct of biometrics and forensics activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability\nassessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders."

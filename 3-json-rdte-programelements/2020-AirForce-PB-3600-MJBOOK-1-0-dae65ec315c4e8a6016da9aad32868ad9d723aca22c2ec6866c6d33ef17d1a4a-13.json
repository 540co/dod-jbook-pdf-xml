            "val": "The Technology Transfer Program captures and manages all intellectual property (IP) (patents and inventions) developed by the Air Force and leads efforts to transfer the IP to commercial sector for the production and transition of the technology to the warfighter.  \n\nTechLink, Department of Defense's (DoD)'s first National level Partnership Intermediary (PI), directly supports these activities for all Air Force, Army, Navy, and independent DoD Research Laboratories. TechLink brokers technology transfer agreements between DoD laboratories and US industry for the manufacture and use of DoD inventions.  These agreements enable DoD to leverage the investment and capabilities of the private-sector in development of new defense-related products and services, lowering DoD costs and also helping ensure that DoD-developed or co-developed technologies are transitioned to DoD operational use.  This program impacts virtually all technology fields, including medicine, software, electronics, communications, advanced materials, and energy-related technologies.\n\nIn FY 2019, Project 646030, AFWERX, was created under this program element to provide centralized funding for AFWERX activities.  AFWERX links innovators to the Air Force's research and development activities, program offices, development planning & experimentation teams, and end users.  These linkages will create capability options and prototype opportunities for the Air Force. AFWERX was previously funded in FY 2017 and FY 2018 with execution year funding from various Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) RDT&E program elements.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFWERX capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Both of these activities enable DoD to leverage the investment and capabilities of the private-sector in development of new defense-related products and services, lowering DoD costs and also helping ensure that DoD-developed or co-developed technologies are transitioned to DoD operational use."

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires continued global collection of CC and TWI data to contribute to the space domain awareness. Without the CC and TWI data, AF production of global predictive weather data would be severely impacted, affecting daily air operations and intelligence gathering for strategic mission planning, especially around the contested environment.\n\nElectro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) Weather Systems (EWS) is a component of JROC-approved SBEM materiel solutions specifically designed to address CC and TWI needs post-DMSP mission end of life.\n\nBased on recently completed SBEM Capability Assessment and Strategy Review (CASR) in April 2019, the current EWS acquisition strategy focuses on a distributed LEO architecture, for scalability and increased operational resilience. The Space Force will pursue prototyping of latest industry capabilities for simplified sensor designs, while meeting CC and TWI requirements and data latencies in a distributed architecture.  The EWS prototyping effort will:\n\n1) Explore low-Size, Weight & Power\/simplified EO\/IR sensor designs in highly competitive design sprints, utilizing variety of experimental\/prototyping contract vehicles \n2) Conduct system technology end-to-end demonstrations, from prototype build, Integration & Test, Launch, ground Telemetry\/Tracking & Commanding (TT&C) and on-orbit data collection to data processing and dissemination to the Weather Centrals\n3) Explore business models for the feasibility of commercially available data. \n\nIn addition, the program may integrate sensors into a commercial & Government communication transport layer, leveraging web services to ensure delivery of data products to end users.\n\nSecondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the SBEM Analysis of Alternatives and validated by the JROC.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EWS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The program will pursue simplified sensor designs and corresponding lower size, weight and power prototypes potentially hosted on a proliferated LEO mesh network.  To minimize risks associated with rapid prototyping effort to replace DMSP constellation, SpEC OT #2 will focus on further developing high maturity EO\/IR system designs in competitive design sprints in a parallel path to SpEC OT #1.

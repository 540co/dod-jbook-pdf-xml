            "val": "The Space Analysis and Application Development program integrates space based effects into Department's \u2018Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&S tools. Enhanced space M&S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations.\n\nNavigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  Funds are used to create and maintain NAVWAR knowledge. NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs). GYPSY POFA's are linked to Combatant Commander's (CCMD) Tier 1 exercises (USSTRATCOM's Global Lightning and Global Thunder are examples) and provide operational realistic threat-representative, GPS-contested environments for analytical assessment of air, ground, maritime, space & cyberspace mission capability.  FORTUNE POFAs are PNT capability and vulnerability assessments associated with a Service exercise or mission event.  PRISM POFAs encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific CCMD and\/or service exercises or mission events.  Assessments inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations in the anticipated theater NAVWAR threat environments. JNWC assesses Department wide PNT posture through the PNT Annual assessment IAW DoDI 4650.08.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Funds are used to create and maintain NAVWAR knowledge. NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs). GYPSY POFA's are linked to Combatant Commander's (CCMD) Tier 1 exercises (USSTRATCOM's Global Thunder and Global Lightning are examples) and provide operational realistic threat-representative, GPS-contested environments for analytical assessment of air, ground, maritime, space & cyberspace mission capability.  FORTUNE POFAs are PNT capability and vulnerability assessments associated with a Service exercise or mission event.  PRISM POFAs encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific CCMD and\/or service exercises or mission events.  Assessments inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations in the anticipated theater NAVWAR threat environments. JNWC assesses department wide PNT posture through the PNT Annual assessment IAW DoDI 4650.08."

This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&S tools. Enhanced space M&S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions.

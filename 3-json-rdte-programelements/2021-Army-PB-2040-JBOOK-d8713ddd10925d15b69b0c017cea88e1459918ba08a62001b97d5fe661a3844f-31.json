            "val": "The JLTV Family of Vehicles (FoV), to include a companion trailer, is a United States Army (USA) acquisition lead, joint program with the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). The JLTV is capable of performing multiple mission roles and designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full range of military operations. JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current fleet; and, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency, reliability, and maintaining effective competition throughout the life cycle. Commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost. Unique service requirements have been minimized.  The JLTV Trailer (JLTV-T) is the companion trailer to the JLTV and safely carries its payload while maintaining the same mobility characteristics of the prime mover.  The trailer requirement as defined in the Capability Production Document (CPD), dated 21 November 2014 was validated on 7 June 2019 by the Army and required the JLTV and JLTV-T to be fielded as a system.  On November 2019, Army Futures Command validated the JLTV-T Army Procurement Objective (APO) of 18,224.\n\nThis program element supports modernization of the JLTV FoV by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.  This program element also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.\n\nThe FY 2021 budget supports the procurement of test assets and the finalization of engineering efforts such as: Li-Ion based technologies and survivability enhancements to optimize the JLTV system architecture and drastically reduce operations and support (O&S) costs; Ongoing development of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) system packaging optimization efforts such as Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) and Integrated Vision Augmentation System (IVAS); Ongoing testing to ensure cyber vulnerabilities are considered and mitigated."

Current contract options may be exercised through 30 November 2023 assuming contractual quantity headspace is still available. Current funding indicates headspace quantity of 16,901 may be achieved in FY 2021, with competitive follow on contract award also anticipated in FY 2022. A split procurement will occur between the existing Oshkosh contract and the new competitively awarded contract based on the approved acquisition strategy. \n\nProgram achieved a successful FRP decision May 2019. The FRP Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed June 2019.\n\nThe trailer requirement as defined in the Capability Production Document (CPD), dated 21 November 2014  was validated on 7 June 2019 by the Army and required the JLTV and JLTV-T to be fielded as a system.  On November 2019, Army Futures Command validated the JLTV-T Army Procurement Objective (APO) of 18,224.\n\nThe JLTV program will continually monitor emerging technologies and capabilities through its partnerships with U.S. Army and Marine Corps science and technology organizations as well as through industry market research and partnerships. The JLTV program will look for opportunities to implement increased capabilities throughout the systems Life Cycle."

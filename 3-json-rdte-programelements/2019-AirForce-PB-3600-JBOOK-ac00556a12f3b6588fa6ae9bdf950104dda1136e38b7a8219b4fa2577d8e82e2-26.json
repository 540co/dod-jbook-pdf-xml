            "val": "The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today. The F-15C\/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night\/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors),forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology. Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Heads Up Display (HUD) and Heads Down Display, instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases,digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system. The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated \"doubledigit\" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and\/or phased technology\/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. This includes technical and acquisition-related studies to ensure F-15 lethality and survivability beyond 2040.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nThis budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The current mission computers of both platforms have reached their limits of speed, memory and throughput.  Additionally, digital systems have changed the security requirements of both platforms and the older mission computers cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirements. A common mission computer is expected to reduce future development and long term maintenance costs.  The program will also develop a new F-15C cockpit display to replace an obsolete one. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nMode 5 enables the NSA-mandated Mode 5 encryption and anti-jam for Air-Air Interrogator (AAI) and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems.  The Mode 5 program will remove, upgrade, and then replace the existing APX-114 and APX-119 on all F-15 aircraft in order to add Mode 5 capability. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nThe Radar Enhancements (EP) will upgrade the digital Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar capabilities to counter sophisticated electronic threats.  Suite 7C introduced EP into the C\/D-model fleet. Initial EP capability for APG-82(V)1 equipped E model aircraft took place in Suite 8E. Suite 9 and beyond will add additional EP capability to both the F-15E and F-15C. \n\nFor the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software and hardware upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line allows the Air Force to release software upgrades approximately every 2 to 3 years.  At any one time, there will normally be three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition\/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort. \n\nInfrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C\/D in a radar-contested environment.\n\nMobile User Objective System (MUOS)\/Second Generation Anti-jam Tactical UUF Radio for NATO(SATURN) will provide Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capable Air Force F-15C\/D\/E aircraft the ability to communicate on the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) constellation in support of a NORTHCOM Airspace Control Alert (ACA) requirement. SATURN to replace the Have Quick II and comply with the NSA lease key mandated dates.\n\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) provides Air Traffic Control position and other secondary surveillance data and must be installed on all CONUS aircraft by 2020 IAW FAA mandate.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

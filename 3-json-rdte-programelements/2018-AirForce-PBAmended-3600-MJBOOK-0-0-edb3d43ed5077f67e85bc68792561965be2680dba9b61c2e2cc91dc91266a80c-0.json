Common Services: funding is for enterprise capabilities that enable mission execution for the Cyber Mission Forces. Common Services includes a Unified Platform (UP) to enable CMF to conduct planning and execution of full-spectrum cyber operations.  UP supports and links the following common service capabilities enabling the CMF: Command and Control; defensive cyber operations; situational awareness; and training and assessment. \n\n    2. Access Platforms: funding supports development of capabilities and\/or infrastructures used by Cyber Mission Forces for employment of access on networks to create effects.  Efforts include research, analysis, testing, assessment and integration.  Further details are held at higher classification levels.\n\n    3. Tools: funding supports development of common and specialized tools critical to gain access to or create effects on networks.  Efforts include research, studies, analysis, testing, assessment of development, integration, and operational assessment of cyberspace capabilities, methodologies and tactics. Funding also supports OCO requirements for Cyber, Joint Task Force ARES.\n\n    4. Analytics: funding supports capabilities used in Cyber Mission Force operations to store, correlate, and analyze data collected from multiple sources to garner unique insights to enable decision making.\n\nThe origin, details and specific aspects of these efforts are classified and will be provided on a need-to-know basis.  \n\nThis is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Common Services: funding is for enterprise capabilities that enable mission execution for the Cyber Mission Forces. Common Services includes a Unified Platform (UP) to enable CMF to conduct planning and execution of full-spectrum cyber operations.  UP supports and links the following common service capabilities enabling the CMF: Command and Control; defensive cyber operations; situational awareness; and training and assessment. \n\n    2. Access Platforms: funding supports development of capabilities and\/or infrastructures used by Cyber Mission Forces for employment of access on networks to create effects.  Efforts include research, analysis, testing, assessment and integration.  Further details are held at higher classification levels.\n\n    3. Tools: funding supports development of common and specialized tools critical to gain access to or create effects on networks.  Efforts include research, studies, analysis, testing, assessment of development, integration, and operational assessment of cyberspace capabilities, methodologies and tactics. Funding also supports OCO requirements for Cyber, Joint Task Force ARES.\n\n    4. Analytics: funding supports capabilities used in Cyber Mission Force operations to store, correlate, and analyze data collected from multiple sources to garner unique insights to enable decision making.\n\nThe origin, details and specific aspects of these efforts are classified and will be provided on a need-to-know basis.  \n\nThis is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

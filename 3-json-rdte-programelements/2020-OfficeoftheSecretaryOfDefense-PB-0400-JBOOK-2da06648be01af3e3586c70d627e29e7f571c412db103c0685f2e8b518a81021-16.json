Effective FY 2020, DIU funding transferred from WHS PE 0603342D8W to OSD PE 0603342D8Z consistent with the realignment and establishment of USD(Research & Engineering), and disestablishment of USD(Acquisition, Technology, & Logistics).

The 2018 National Defense Strategy asserts that we have returned to an era of inter-state strategic competition with Russia and China, heightening the sense of urgency with which the nation, and DoD in particular, must reform our acquisition policies and approach to sustaining military-technical superiority.  Adversaries are challenging the U.S. across several dimensions.  Most importantly, adversaries are at par or ahead of the U.S. in critical technology areas.  Consistent with the FY 2020 OMB\/OSTP research and development budget priorities, this new era of competition requires technological superiority to ensure ability to project power, maintain international norms and rule of law, and to serve as a credible deterrence.  Notably, the critical technologies that forge military-technical superiority are increasingly dual-use and rapidly developed by the commercial sector.  The DIU program will find and provide access to leading-edge technology companies on behalf of DoD organizations.   Additionally, DIU will execute projects to leverage commercial sector technology analogous to military application thereby increasing dual-use technology agility for the DoD."

In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)). In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). Effective FY 2020, DIU will transfer from WHS PE 0603342D8W to OSD PE 0603342D8Z with a functional realignment of resources across the FYDP to OUSD(R&E).  In FY 2018 and FY 2019, this program had $23.498 million and $29.198 million, respectively, in PE 0603342D8W.

One of the tenets of this priority is to expand the Department's ability to access leading edge technological innovations through commercial partnerships.  The funding DIUx executes is critical as it incentivizes non-traditional defense sector companies to work with and invest in advancing DoD future capabilities.  \n\n Some of the projects undertaken include:  \n- Hardened Network Defense that provides warfighters improved network security by obscuring vital services and data, thereby significantly decreasing the ability of advancing cyber threats to map, attack or exploit tactical systems.\n- Command, Control, and Situational Awareness web-based software platform that supports user's ability to visualize relevant activities and operational metrics, collaboratively plan and approve defense activities, and monitor\/manage subsequent.  DIUx projects signal investment targets for venture capital opportunities.  While these are small when compared to the DoD total budget, the 3rd party investment multiplier they generate are without equal."

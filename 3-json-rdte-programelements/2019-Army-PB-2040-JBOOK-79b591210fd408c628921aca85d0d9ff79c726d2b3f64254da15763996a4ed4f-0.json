            "val": "The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget estimate request funds the development of Aircraft Avionics systems required to horizontally and vertically integrate the battlefield and the integration of those systems into Army aircraft. Tasks in this Program Element support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.\n\nThe Doppler Global Positioning System Navigation Set (DGNS) Upgrade program completes system engineering trade studies to reduce space, weight, and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as inertial sensor, MIL-STD-1553 interface card, and Instrument Flight Rules map display.  It also prepares Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to the existing DGNS ASN-128D Line Replaceable Units (LRU) as a result of those trade studies.  The DGNS upgrade continues with execution of Non-Recurring Engineering for Computer Display Unit (CDU) and Signal Data Converter LRU ECP packages.  The ASN-128D CDU upgrade replaces the current CDU faceplate with a touch screen display, provides a moving navigation map capability and optimizes pilot interface to augment existing Instrument Flight Rules capability promoting safer flight operations.  The CDU upgrade will support Assured-Position Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) operations in conjunction with additional system LRU upgrades, includes anti-jam antenna capabilities, and supports Department of Defense (DoD) and Army's requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations.  This will require assessment and follow-on upgrade to the DGNS navigation system.  The CDU upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance and associated PNT capability gaps, and will evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.\n\nThe Enhanced Aviation GATM Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) Navigation System (EAGLE) A-PNT integration program assesses current capabilities in identified operational PNT environment levels, tests identified upgrades to existing EGI hardware in order to accommodate A-PNT in identified operational environments, and incorporates M-Code.  It supports DoD and Army's requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations and requires assessment and follow-on upgrade to the EGI navigation system.  The EAGLE upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance, associated PNT capability gaps, integrate anti-jam antenna capabilities, and evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.\n\nThe Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Increment I program increases survivability due to DVE brownout conditions encountered during takeoff and landing. The DVE Increment I program is equally applicable to training scenarios as well as tactical operations. DVE Increment I will combine sensor(s) technology with critical aircraft flight information (aircraft state data) to provide an initial capability that increases aircrew awareness through detection and warning of hazardous terrain and obstacles. DVE Increment I improves safety, reduces risk, and maximizes flexibility for Aviation units. DVE Increment I activities include development, system testing, qualification, and aircraft integration. \n\nThe DVE Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) is an Army Directed Requirement (DR) to provide DVE systems to 15 HH-60M Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters and 25 Special Operations aircraft. The DVE QRC DR fulfills an immediate DVE requirement while bridging the gap between future DVE capabilities pursued within the DVE Increment I program of record. The DVE QRC DR provides a forward looking, situational awareness, fused-sensor image for single aircraft takeoff and landing in brownout conditions.   \n\nThe Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army aviation automated information system program providing specific capabilities needed at the aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation operations, safety, and training to increase operational effectiveness and situational awareness at all command echelons.  ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement the DoD mandated Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. ADEC will standardize flight scheduling\/management, risk management, mission approval, and flight data analysis and visualization. ADEC provides interfaces to Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS) to reduce data entry and the information technology footprint while enabling disconnected and split based operations.\n\nThe Improved Data Modem (IDM) provides digital connectivity among airborne and ground platforms and transmission of air-to-air target data between IDM equipped aircraft using existing radio and crypto equipment. IDM new software architecture will incorporate the ability to host IDM functionality on hardware that meets the minimum requirements to run the IDM Operating Flight Program. These efforts will include development and testing of that capability, as well as any documentation required to ensure Government Purpose rights to the new software."

The DVE QRC DR fulfills an immediate DVE requirement while bridging the gap between future DVE capabilities pursued within the DVE Increment I program of record. The DVE QRC DR provides a forward looking, situational awareness, fused-sensor image for single aircraft takeoff and landing in brownout conditions.   \n\nThe Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Increment I program increases survivability due to DVE brownout conditions encountered during takeoff and landing. The DVE Increment I program is equally applicable to training scenarios as well as tactical operations. DVE Increment I will combine sensor(s) technology with critical aircraft flight information (aircraft state data) to provide an initial capability that increases aircrew awareness through detection and warning of hazardous terrain and obstacles.

Tasks in this Program Element Support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.\n\nThe DVE Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) is an Army Directed Requirement (DR) to provide DVE systems to 15 HH-60M Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters and 25 Special Operations aircraft. The DVE QRC DR fulfills an immediate DVE requirement while bridging the gap between future DVE capabilities pursued within the DVE Increment I program of record. The DVE QRC DR provides a forward looking, situational awareness, fused-sensor image for single aircraft takeoff and landing in brownout conditions.   \n\nThe Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Increment I program increases survivability due to DVE brownout conditions encountered during takeoff and landing. The DVE Increment I program is equally applicable to training scenarios as well as tactical operations. DVE Increment I will combine sensor(s) technology with critical aircraft flight information (aircraft state data) to provide an initial capability that increases aircrew awareness through detection and warning of hazardous terrain and obstacles. DVE Increment I improves safety, reduces risk, and maximizes flexibility for Aviation units. DVE Increment I activities include development, system testing, qualification, and aircraft integration. \n\nThe Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army aviation automated information system program providing specific capabilities needed at the aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation operations, safety, and training to increase operational effectiveness and situational awareness at all command echelons. ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement the DoD mandated Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. ADEC will standardize flight scheduling\/management, risk management, mission approval, and flight data analysis and visualization. ADEC provides interfaces to Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS) to reduce data entry and the information technology footprint while enabling disconnected and split based operations.\n\nThe Improved Data Modem (IDM) provides digital connectivity among airborne and ground platforms and transmission of air-to-air target data between IDM equipped aircraft using existing radio and crypto equipment. IDM new software architecture will incorporate the ability to host IDM functionality on hardware that meets the minimum requirements to run the IDM Operating Flight Program. These efforts will include development and testing of that capability, as well as any documentation required to ensure Government Purpose rights to the new software."

The DVE QRC DR acquisition strategy is to leverage an existing contract competitively awarded by the Technology Applications Program Office.  An Other Government Agency will perform the installation of the DVE QRC DR system into the designated aircraft. A disposition analysis of the DVE QRC DR will inform the DVE Increment I acquisition strategy. The DVE Increment I acquisition strategy is to leverage the DVE QRC DR materiel solution for installation onto additional aircraft."

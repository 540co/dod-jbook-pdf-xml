UAV Hunter turbocharger investigation at the U.S. ARL VTD at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  Also provides research to support airworthiness, reliability and performance improvements of Hunter UAV turbocharger. An alternate turbocharger is required to support airworthiness, reliability and performance of Hunter UAS engine.  The Hunter UAS has experienced ?Soft Rotation? due to the aircraft?s inability to achieve an engine speed sufficient for take-off (i.e. insufficient thrust). The increased frequency in soft rotations during take-off increases the risk of potential damage to equipment or injury to personnel due to the potential for the aircraft to depart the runway after rotation rather than taking flight.  Testing has demonstrated that the current turbocharger is operating very close to the surge limit.  The engine calibration limits turbocharger speed.  However, there is no potential for an increase in performance with the currently installed turbocharger."

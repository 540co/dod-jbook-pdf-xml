            "val": "In alignment with the National Defense Strategy, the Defense Modernization and Prototyping (DM&P) Program Element (PE) supports the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) with innovation-focused experimentation and prototyping to deliver joint mission capabilities to the warfighter at the speed of relevance.  DM&P\u2019s mission-focused capabilities cross functional domains and enhance warfighter lethality, technical superiority, adaptability, and resilience.  DM&P funding supports joint prototype development, joint experimentation for concept of operations (CONOPs) development, and red teaming validations that enable disruptive innovation to sustain the United States' operational superiority.  The DM&P PE enables the USD(R&E) vision for next generation platforms, weapons systems, fire control, sensors, logistics, and communications.  The consolidated nature of the DM&P PE increases the Department\u2019s ability to coordinate activities across the Services, Defense Agencies, and international partners; provides the agility to rapidly pivot to new threats; and, supplies the resources necessary to ensure a technological overmatch against future threats.  This realignment directly supports the Department\u2019s modernization plans by streamlining investments, reducing the time from discovery to deployment, and enabling development of disruptive technologies to help realize the National Defense Strategy. \n\nDM&P prototyping projects increase the speed of technology innovation by reducing technology risk for capabilities addressing modernization challenges.  With an emphasis on joint and interagency partnerships, DM&P matures capability options to anticipate and inform new acquisition pathways in addition to formal requirements and acquisition processes.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Department of Defense (DoD) modernization priorities, National Defense Strategy, the Chairman\u2019s Capability Gap Assessment, and the Combatant Commands\u2019 Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).  The DM&P PE supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new joint mission capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Emerging Capability Technology Development (ECTD), 2) Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP), 3) Red Teaming, and 4) Time Sensitive Target Defeat (TSTD).  Completed DM&P projects transition to joint programs through fielded operationally relevant prototypes; technology adoption into programs of record; integration into system level, multi-year joint demonstrations; and through advanced research and engineering efforts like the Warfighting Lab Incentive Fund for further development of tactics, techniques, procedures, and concepts of operations.\n\nThe DM&P PE will continue to leverage the year of execution processes that enabled ECTD and QRSP to quickly and effectively respond to emergent innovation opportunities through the rapid development and transition of risk reducing prototypes.  DM&P prototyping activities include initial concept discovery of potentially game-changing capabilities through relatively low cost risk reducing prototypes; and, high-fidelity prototyping of advanced systems in partnership with the Services, Defense Agencies, and allies to inform the acquisition of new joint mission capabilities though experimentation and red teaming."

These lower-cost prototypes and QRSP\u2019s innovative business processes give the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) the agility to quickly explore new, higher-risk technology areas that have the potential for immediate, game-changing impacts.  Developed prototypes inform modernization efforts or transition through rapid technology refresh and insertion into joint mission capabilities.  QRSP also enables the DoD to identify innovated solutions from small and non-traditional business not normally engaged by the DoD to address gaps and augment joint mission capabilities. Project selection is guided by department-level strategies and priorities, such as the DoD\u2019s modernization areas and the National Defense Strategy.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and deliver affordable capabilities faster than standard acquisition cycles.  With an emphasis on joint and interagency partnerships, QRSP matures capability options to anticipate and inform new acquisition pathways in addition to formal requirements and acquisition processes.  \n\nQRSP includes thrust areas that complement risk-reducing prototypes, such as Strategic Multi-layer Assessments (SMA) and joint demonstrations and experiments. SMA supports senior leadership in the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) by providing rapid, actionable assessments of complex operational and technical challenges.  Joint demonstrations and DM&P-sponsored venues of defense-wide experiments provide opportunities for emerging technologies to succeed, or fail fast.  Demonstration venues include: Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, a multi-domain venue focused on innovative small and non-traditional businesses; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  Individual projects generally span 6 to 18 months, typically at a cost of less than $1.000 million."

Demonstration venues enable Joint Program Offices, Service, and Combatant Command user evaluation of emerging novel technologies in relevant environments.  Demonstration venues include the Thunderstorm venue for small and non-traditional businesses; the Stiletto maritime technology platform; and, other tailored multi-domain venues and ad-hoc demonstrations.  These experimentation and demonstration venues support the rapid discovery and transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations.  The venues provide the DoD and interagency partners with an opportunity to identify and evaluate new and emerging technologies both from commercial and government sectors through a series of technology demonstrations, experiments, vignettes, and related activities.  The venues also offer a streamlined experimentation and demonstration process that encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter.  These engagements enable rapid innovation and adoption of new technologies to meet operational needs through the exploration of military utility, and identification of potential risks of emerging technologies."

ECTD leverages rapid prototyping processes to include Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) and Other Transition Authorities (OTA) that seek to demonstrate a novel technology or concept in a relevant environment within a 30-month period then transition it to an operational user. ECTD activities refine future warfighting concepts, inform Service Program of Record (PoR) capability requirements, and provide residual joint mission capability through leave behind test articles.  \n\nAnticipated FY 2021 investments areas target the following key mission areas: Advanced Electronic Warfare (EW); Fully Networked Command, Control, and Communication (FNC3); Joint Fires and Targeting; Contested Logistics Operations; and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) to support Time-Critical Targeting.  Projects will be identified through soliciting concepts from Service, CCMDs, industry, academia, Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and Department of Defense laboratories.  Efforts are designed to encourage teaming between organizations to generate integrated concepts that result in leap-ahead mission capabilities. This process also focuses related Service and Defense Agency projects to a common set of gaps addressing peer engagements.  Individual projects generally span one to three years, typically at a cost of less than $15.000 million.  ECTD prototypes, demonstrations, and experiments enable developers to showcase new and maturing capabilities in realistic environments and against realistic threats with operational user involvement."

The focus area is aimed at rapidly developing prototype technologies and demonstrations of systems to: (1) semi-autonomously detect, identify, track, prioritize, and engage targets with operator determination; (2) autonomously detect, classify threats or threat signals, then recommend defensive or offensive actions to the operator. Prototypes developed in this focus area will be delivered to Joint and Service users to evaluate joint mission capabilities under realistic conditions and against current adversaries or anticipated threats. Development of advanced prototypes will involve partnerships with industry and academia and permit operational users to gain insight into future technology-enabled strategies and tactics."

The Red Teaming project supports assessments and demonstrations to stress and assess emerging systems with the intent of gaining or maintaining overmatch earlier in the life cycle.  The project helps to assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies and newly developed systems, and helps identify unanticipated disruptive opportunities and technological dead ends.  The project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally representative environments and against potential threats prior to full funding commitments.  The Red Teaming project supports three broad types of red teaming: 1) Early stage horizon scanning and assessments of weaknesses and opportunities of pre-development technologies from an adversary perspective; 2) Targeted, low-fidelity prototypes to assess utility and inform design choices prior to funding commitments; and 3) Red teams, war games, and field experiments with maturing technology to understand how to implement new technologies and adapt to adversary responses.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of other defense red teaming organizations within the Department, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia.  Deliverables will inform requirements, develop new concepts of operations (CONOPS), and help accelerate technology acquisition pathways for joint missions."

Efforts include: 1.) Early investigations and red teaming to identify and understand potential vulnerabilities and opportunities from emerging and conceptual technologies.  Projects will help define and anticipate impacts from new technologies, including current DoD investments and external technologies, to understand operational utility and identify threats from tangentially related sectors that can have significant negative impacts on current DoD investments.  2.) Maturation of Service and Defense Agency identified prototypes to enable red teaming, demonstrations, experiments, and CONOPS earlier in the development cycle.  These prototypes increase agility and rate of innovation for emerging capabilities, while reducing cost and risk.  3.) Exploring unconventional approaches to counter current DoD and adversary technologies through red teams, war games, simulation exercises, and studies that employ government laboratory scientists; subject matter experts; and, students of science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines.  Red teaming events range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants.  Deliverables include characterizations of future prototypes, requirement definitions, recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures that could be taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The USD(R&E) will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new CONOPS."

            "val": "The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) ensures the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP is executed by the STEM Development Office, under the Defense Laboratories Office within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)).  NDEP\u2019s portfolio includes the Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program, the Military Child Pilot Program (MCPP), STEM Education and Outreach, and STEM Operations.  These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) increasing STEM proficiency in the Nation\u2019s talent pool by improving the capacity to address ever-changing future Defense workforce needs; (2) shaping the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through public communications and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts and coordinating STEM efforts in alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) identifying approaches for innovative solutions in support of the Nation's current and future defense challenges. \n\nNDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan, and the DoD Agency Strategic Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and transitions graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for broadly relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 2,000 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 1,350 have completed program studies and approximately 1,100 are currently employed in the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission.\n\nSTEM Education and Outreach fosters conditions for activities to support and cultivate STEM talent to build a future force that is representative of the nation\u2019s diverse population and to reach underserved populations to meet national defense needs and future defense challenges.  Initiatives include investing, promoting and participating in national-level STEM programs and initiatives, and providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the nation.\n\nSTEM Operations manages activities to implement the Department\u2019s strategic plan for STEM education and outreach.  STEM Operations provides program management and oversight, research studies, and official responses to Congressional and non-Congressional inquiries.  STEM Operations develops and maintains systems and standards to support STEM policy implementation, oversight, and assessment.  Other STEM Operations activities include providing support to STEM education and outreach programs, implementing the Communications Plan, and collaborating across the federal government and public domain through interagency and intradepartmental working groups and partnerships.\n\nThe MCPP enhances the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, directed the Secretary of the Defense to establish this Pilot Program.  The MCPP will continue to receive support through FY 2020 in accordance with legislative direction."

The disciplines include: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  A total of 800 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD commitment; 75 percent of those participants are still employed by DoD.\n\nOversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs, and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in relevant hands-on research, and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.\n\nSince FY 2005, approximately 2,000 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2016, approximately 1,350 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components."

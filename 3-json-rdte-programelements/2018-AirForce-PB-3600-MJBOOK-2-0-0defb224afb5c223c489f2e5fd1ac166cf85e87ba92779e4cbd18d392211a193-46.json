TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond-Line- of-Sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications. TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the data link to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions. TDLs are used by all service theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. \n\nTDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT). TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016E) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.\n\nThis effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball. TDLs keep all Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) platforms and data linked weapons current\/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA \/ DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. Due to new\/evolving Link 16 User identified Interface Changes Proposals (ICPs), studies and analysis will be performed to identify impacts to current and future systems, and to identify the required changes and impacts of implementing these new capabilities. The activities will include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

These actions ensure TDLs are procured and maintained as a joint, end-to-end C2 system. This program executes various types of contract types to provide technical expertise necessary to test, evaluate and provide recommended solutions to modernize C2 platform data links. The program delivers annual lab-tested software implementations of AWACS Link 16 ICPs. Additionally, the program participates in annual lab demonstrations that produce reports as required to assist with platform integration of Link 16 modernization efforts.\n\nThe E-3 Platform architecture utilizes a JTIDS Class 2H Link 16 radio with defined environmental and physical cabinet constraints. An Investigation Report (IR) was initiated to investigate the integration of an Ethernet-enabled CMN4 MIDS JTRS variant into the E-3 platform. A separate IR was issued to understand the dynamics of the L-16 enhancements and facilitate integration of new Link 16 capabilities onto the E-3 platform to ensure cross-service interoperability."

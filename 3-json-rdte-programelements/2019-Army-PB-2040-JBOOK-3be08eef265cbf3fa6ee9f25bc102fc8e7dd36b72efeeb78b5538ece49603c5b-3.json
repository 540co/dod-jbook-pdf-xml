            "val": "Project 323, the Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program, acquires and sustains highly flexible, customized, cost effective, common, and simplified non-developmental Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) solutions that improve interoperability and connectivity on the battlefield while garnering efficient competition to integrate the latest commercial technology onto the Army tactical network. CHS provides technical support, environmental and evaluation testing, system design, and end of life\/configuration management across Army tactical programs  to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the development of capabilities. CHS hardware evaluations facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across the operational battlefield. CHS creates efficiencies through the acquisition of streamlined common hardware configurations across the Common Operating Environments (COE)s, the sustainment community, and tactical programs. CHS also provides logistical services to include worldwide 72-hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements. \n \nProject 334, the Common Software (CS) program, is the suite of systems through which the Army develops, integrates and tests common software products and\/or components used for communication between Army Mission Command Systems and Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Mission Command (MC) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort.  The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems.  The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's COE modernization efforts. There is no FY19 RDTE funding since Common SW will be transitioning into sustainment in FY19.\n \nProject C29, the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF), is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of system verification\/validation checkout, testing, and configuration management for the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. \n \nProject C34 funds the PEO Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Technical Management Division (TMD), which effectively manages the System-of-Systems engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts for the continuing evolution of the network within the PEO C3T portfolio of technology across the capability enhancement packages to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solutions.  \n\nProject EJ5, the Mounted Computing Environment (MCE), is one of the six computing environments (CEs) formalized by the AAE under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative. MCE standardizes end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications. The JBC-P is the foundational hardware element of the MCE. MCE enables Mission Command capability development to echelons from dismounted command nodes to echelons above corps, providing enhanced interoperability, and simplified end-user interface. Requirements for the MCE are established in the draft Mounted Computing Environment Information System Initial Capabilities Document (MCE IS CDD).  FY2019 funding provides the means to continue to manage and develop MCE in concert with CPCE.\n  \nProject EJ4, the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), is one of the computing environments under the Common Operating Environment (COE).  It provides a common framework (Common Infrastructure \/ Common Services) upon which future Warfighter capabilities can be built. The CPCE targets Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA) capability development at tactical echelons that span from Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to company level. The CPCE will be the most critical computing environment developed to support the command posts and combat operations. \n \nProject EJ7, Tactical Digital Media (TDM), is comprised of photo, video and audio recording and editing equipment that will be assembled and issued as variant kits tailored to unit mission requirements. TDM kits address modernization gaps associated with all operational Combat Camera (COMCAM), Public Affairs (PA), and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) units. TDM provides essential imagery, multimedia products, and live interview capabilities that directly contribute to successful execution of a Commander's strategic engagement and communications strategy across the full range of military operations.  No FY19 RDTE funding.\n \nProject EK9, Tactical Network Operations (NetOps) Management (TNOM), will support the development and integration of the Tactical NetOps software capabilities in support of Network Operations (NetOps) Convergence, Army Objectives and emerging Cyber Center of Excellence (CCOE) requirements. The end state program is designed to synchronize LandWarNet, Network-enabled Mission Command, and Global Information Grid 2.0 Network Operations (NetOps) efforts in an integrated and interoperable framework, spanning all echelons of command and supporting the full range of military operations for Army, Joint, and Coalition Forces in order to ensure converged NetOps. The initial mission is convergence of DoD Information Network (DoDIN) functions into a single integrated set of Tactical NetOps and Management software. This integrated solution provides NetOps capability to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Theater network entry point and supports the implementation of integrated NetOps for Unified Network Operations (UNO). UNO will deliver a standardized visualization capability (integrating both Upper and Lower Tactical Internet NetOps) in order to reduce complexity and inform the military decision making processes. UNO will also provide enhanced capability to detect, respond, and restore from cyber incidents.\n\nProject ER9, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2), fields mobile Command Post Nodes by integrating supporting mission command solutions in accordance with Directed Requirement with a FY20 First Unit Equipped in order to enhance the survivability and mobility of brigade and below command post formations. On order, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure will replace selected elements of the legacy command post to provide improved expeditionary capability, survivability, agility, and scalability for Corps and Division Main and Tactical Command Posts, Brigade Main and Tactical Command Posts, and Battalion Command Posts. It will ensure information and support systems are introduced into the Command Post through physical integration allowing the commander to tailor the Command Post as missions dictate.\n\nProject EQ8, Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment, supports the Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program.  The program leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations.  The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader.  \n\nProject EW3, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR), is the process performed by the S6 and their staff to affect change on the network in order to support the operational mission and dynamic nature of the Army.  Currently network challenges exist during this process with regard to:  maintaining accurate and up to date information,  distributing configuration files and activating \/ re-establishing the network.  UTR strives to make authoritative NETOPS available across all systems, reduce cognitive burden for soldiers to plan and manage the network and reduce manual touch labor.   \n\nProject EJ6, Tactical Enhancement, supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Modular Communications Node - Advanced Equipment (MCN-AE), Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Site and beyond line of sight radio systems. SIGMOD Capabilities include: \nMCN-AE: Provides Top Secret\/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) communications to Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Signal Battalions over the WIN-T network; TRILOS: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS). \nTRILOS: Enables Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) radio verses the aging HCLOS system.\nTROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System. TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth."

CHS provides a coherent migration strategy for acquisition of warfighting systems and new technology through the use of technology insertion. CHS also conducts common environmental testing of hardware items thereby reducing the testing requirements for individual Project Managers. CHS provides contractual tools that enable supported programs to effectively and efficiently establish organic sustainment support for commercial IT and utilizes hardware failure data and logistical analysis to support programs sustainment strategy decisions.\n\nAn Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity firm fixed priced, full and open competition contract was awarded to General Dynamics in May 2003, for ruggedization and production. In August 2011, CHS awarded, on a best value basis, the follow-on CHS-4 contract via full and open competition.  CHS-5 is to be awarded in FY18 to provide flexibility for Tactical Programs of Record (PoR)s to meet hardware and associated services requirements through full and open competition and to provide an agile solution to support COE, network integration activities, capability set development, and logistical requirements."

The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the C4ISR systems, and a core communication component of the virtualized infrastructure and will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command (PM MC) General Services Administration (GSA) engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on a single development solicitation. This strategy is designed to optimize opportunities for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition, and to ensure the rapid integration of new capabilities into warfighter systems. This strategy is also designed to reduce the physical footprint, the logistics support requirements, and to increase operational efficiency by integration of additional system interoperability services which reduce duplication of effort and cost; and allows for development of communication standards across the DoD community."

The CTSF provides validated test data to the Department of the Army and Joint agencies to accredit interoperability certifications.  The distributed test environment of the CTSF is accomplished through the Federation of Net-centric Sites (FaNS) construct.  This FaNS construct addresses distributed integration development and testing using the core infrastructure of the CTSF to harness AMC, Army, and Joint expertise\/resources.  Through these federated resources, the CTSF executes interoperability development and certification testing of the Warfighter mission areas, to include Network Evaluation spinouts, as they digitize and become part of the Army's LandWarNet."

TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Site and beyond line of sight radio systems. In addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current WIN-T SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti-jam capability and resiliency to WIN-T Program of Record satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on currently fielded WIN-T satellite modems as well as those planned to be fielded for tech refresh in the near term.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY28\/29).  The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events.  FY19 funding begins the Army's concentrated effort for near term satellite anti-jam protection.\n\n\nSIGMOD Capabilities: \nTRILOS: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS).  TRILOS will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) radio verses the aging HCLOS system. \nTROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System.  TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth.\nNo FY18 funding:   Testing requirements for TROPO moved from FY18 to FY19  due to a delay in requirements definition and availability of COTS products to meet the requirement.\n\nFY19 funds support TROPO test requirement and NCW-R future development and developmental testing effort."

TDM provides essential imagery, multimedia products, and live interview capabilities that directly contribute to successful execution of a Commander's strategic engagement and communications strategy across the full range of military operations. TDM also provides specific imagery, video, and multimedia support to commanders through the National Command Authority (NCA) level to assist with operational planning, decision-making, combat adversary misinformation\/disinformation, alter perceptions regarding coalition efforts, and provide accurate and timely information to national and international audiences. Proposed TDM equipment is entirely commercial off the shelf (COTS) which is currently in use by military organizations and commercial industry.\n\nFY17 Base funding in the amount of $2.467 million will be used to procure and evaluate representative candidate commercial off the shelf (COTS) camera and video equipment for effectiveness, suitability, and reliability.  FY17 efforts will include planning for full rate production decision, type classification, and award of a production delivery order to support future procurements.\n\nNo FY18 RDTE funding."

The initial mission is convergence of DoD Information Network (DoDIN) functions into a single integrated set of Tactical NetOps and Management software. This integrated solution provides NetOps capability to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Enterprise network entry point and supports the implementation of integrated NetOps for Unified Network Operations (UNO). UNO will deliver a standardized visualization capability (integrating both Upper and Lower Tactical Internet NetOps) in order to reduce complexity and inform the military decision making processes. UNO will also provide enhanced capability to detect, respond, and restore from cyber incidents.\n\nFY19 funding will continue supporting the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to include supporting efforts for the development of Network Operations software, enhancing Network Visualization and Monitoring of the tactical network, standardizing data definition and storage to support Common Operational Picture, and simplify planning and configuration process for multiple network devices and radios. FY19 funding will continue supporting NetOps capability enhancements via an adapt and buy strategy. The UNO Program Office Management will utilize FY19 funding in support of requisite milestone documentation preparation prior to a projected 4QFY20 milestone decision.  FY19 funding will continue supporting the NetOps capability enhancements via an adapt and buy strategy.

Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to the tactical vehicle-mounted leaders so that when dismounted, the leader still maintains the common operating picture (COP) and has continuous situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and enhanced communications to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight.  Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.\n\nThe continued development and integration of the NW program also integrates applications from other programs aimed at considerably reducing the weight and bulk of the dismounted Soldier's load by using a single End User Device. The NW program harnesses Soldiers' experience in combat operations and employs combat veterans for Soldier feedback enhancing human factors design and fightability of the system. This project funds the following: 1) Incorporation of additional new hardware applications and capabilities into Nett Warrior, 2) Yearly developmental and operational tests of the NW with continually advancing commercial smart device technology inserted, 3) Software development for planned updates, 4) Integration of new End User Devices with the existing and re-competed Army Tactical Radios, including vehicle power integration, 5) Government led integration and system engineering and program management, and 6) Integration with emerging transport systems.\n\nNote:  FY16 and prior funding for Nett Warrior resided in 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem\/Val) Project S75 (Ground Soldier Ensemble)."

The NW is focused on Team Leader and higher echelons and provides an integrated secure information-centric Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) mobile application-based computation platform with data collection, enhanced SA, mission planning, and navigational aid functions overlaid on geo-referenced maps and high resolution imagery throughout a brigade.  The NW enables real-time ground tactical-level knowledge sharing and command and control (C2), directly impacting combat effectiveness and decision-making.  The NW also improves lower echelon intelligence production and analysis capabilities which are central to efficient and effective counter-insurgency warfare.  NW program completed LRIP\/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&E under DOT&E oversight in 4QFY14-1QFY15.  This IOT&E event led to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision is planned for early FY18.  From this decision NW will complete annual production and fielding events based on yearly development, integration and testing of emerging advanced smart devices to lower cost, weigh and power.  To capitalize on commercial industry's investment in advanced smart device technology as well as innovation and changes within Army, NW requires annual RDT&E funding for integration and evaluation.  Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures."

Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications - Tactical (PEO C3T) will develop mobile Command Post solutions by integrating supporting mission command and communications systems in accordance with a Directed Requirement (14 Dec 2017) and Capability Development Document.  CPI2 replaces legacy command post systems at Corps, Division, and Brigade Combat Team and below command post formations with more capable, survivable, agile, and scalable command post solutions.   It will ensure information and support systems are introduced into the Command Post through physical integration allowing the commander to tailor the Command Post as missions dictate. CPI2 was established to meet the emerging threat environment to improve the survivability and mobility of current Command Posts.  The Directed Requirement First Unit Equipped is in FY20.\n\nFY19 funding provides for acquiring  platforms for System Design, Prototyping and integration solutions for select Mission Command Platforms (MCP) and Command Post Support Vehicles (CPSV).    The CPSV is a formation appropriate vehicle that hosts mission command servers, radios, local area network systems and unified voice management capability and secure wireless in support of the Integrated Command Post at the Halt.  The MCP is a formation appropriate vehicle that provides a digitally connected workspace to support commanders and staff at the Corps\/Division Command Group, Main and Tactical Command Posts and at the Brigade and Battalion Command Posts and Command Groups.  FY19 funding will also support the procurement of two brigade sets of coalition gateways to prototype and assess existing solutions to provide the Army a seamless information network exchanges and integration of Joint and legacy radios as an interim solution toward the future transport layer.  It will provide commanders a rugged and portable air-to-ground command and control capability that enables Link 16, a simultaneous line-of-sight and\/or satellite communication.  The Army seeks an integrated message translation capability to form incompatible messages from disparate networks into a clear common operating picture, improving the prevention of fratricide and collateral damage while also raising ISR visibility."

One Early User Test (EUT) will be executed with the intended First Unit Equipped (FUE) unit to allow feedback into the initial Command Post (CP) design. A Request For Proposal (RFP) will be released for a production contract for the M1079 CPSV in 1QFY20 with a projected award in 3QFY20 to produce four brigade sets.  The OTA contract will be used to produce four brigade sets of M1087 MCPs.\n\nThe CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD) is projected for Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approval in FY18 with a Milestone B projected for 1QFY20. Competitive contract award planned for 1QFY21 based on Request For Proposal (RFP) responses and source selection process. This contract will be a 5-year Firm Fixed Priced\/Cost Plus Fixed Fee (FFP\/CPFF) contract for the design, engineering, prototyping, Developmental Test (DT), new equipment training, one Limited User Test (LUT), and one Operational Test (OT) which will encompass CPI2 variants at Division HQ and BCT echelons with Option Years for production.

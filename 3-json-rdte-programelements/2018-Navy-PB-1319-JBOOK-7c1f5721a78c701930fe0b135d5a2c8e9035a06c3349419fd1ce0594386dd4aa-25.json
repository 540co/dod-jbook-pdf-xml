The SoS will address MAGTF EW sufficiency gaps in the areas of Electronic Attack, EW Support, and Electronic Protection with a multitude of payloads designed for carriage on a variety of organic MAGTF air and ground assets. Payload development plans follow an adaptable, modular and open architecture philosophy to combat the increasing capability gap and enable future growth at a reduced operational and sustainment cost.\n\nThe AN\/ALQ-231(V)1 pod is the Fixed-Wing variant of the Intrepid Tiger II pod flown on the AV-8B and F\/A-18A-D platforms.  The AN\/ALQ-231(V)2 will be the variant of the Intrepid Tiger II pod flown on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms once integration is complete.  The AN\/ALQ-231(V)3 is the Rotary-Wing variant of the Intrepid Tiger II pod flown on the AH-1 and UH-1 platforms.  As of the PresBud15 submission, the AN\/ALQ-231(V)1 was the only approved configuration and nomenclature for the Intrepid Tiger II pod. The re-designation of the ALQ-231 variants occurred with the approval of Rapid Deployment Capability authorization for AN\/ALQ-231 on Rotary Wing platforms by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition (ASN(RD&A)) on January 14, 2014.\n\nCommencing in FY 2017, Intrepid Tiger II efforts are budgeted under PE 0604270N, PU 3327."

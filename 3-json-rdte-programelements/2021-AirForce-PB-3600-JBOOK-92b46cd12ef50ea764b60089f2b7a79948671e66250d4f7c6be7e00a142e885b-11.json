The effort supports core technical competencies of fuze technology; energetic materials; damage mechanisms; munitions aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, and control; terminal seeker sciences; and munition systems effects.  Technologies to be developed include blast, fragmentation, penetrating and low-collateral damage war-heads, hard-target fuzing, precise terminal guidance, and high-performance and insensitive explosives.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

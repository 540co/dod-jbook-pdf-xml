Key operating principles include a short and narrow chain of command, overarching programmatic insight, early and prominent war fighter involvement, and small integrated teams within a single office to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed, to expand operational capability, reconstitute\/replenish\/protect critical space capabilities to reserve \"continuity of operations\" capability, and exploit space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage. \n            \nThe Space RCO is ready to develop, test, train, and equip war fighter needs as they are identified at any time. First, the requirements must be validated by the commander, USSTRATCOM, acting through U.S. Space Command; second, the project must be approved by the Space RCO BoD; third, the project will be executed by the Space RCO. If the effort is initiated during execution year, it will be described in the next year's budget exhibit.\n                        \nSpace RCO is supporting the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) developed Space Solar Power project to collect solar energy and provide uninterrupted, assured, and logistically agile power to expeditionary forces operating in unimproved areas such as forward operating bases.  AFRL formulated the Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research (SSPIDR) project to rapidly demonstrate this innovative technology via a series of Integrated demos and technology development\/maturation efforts.\n            \nIn addition, Space RCO will conduct studies and analysis for future programs to support the BoD.\n            \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Space RCO weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \n            This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

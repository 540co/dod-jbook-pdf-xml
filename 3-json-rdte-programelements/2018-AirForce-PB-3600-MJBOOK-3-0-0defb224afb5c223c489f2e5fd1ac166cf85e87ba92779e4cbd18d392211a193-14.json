The COE provides expertise to Headquarters Air Force, AF major commands (MAJCOM), and weapon system program offices regarding CNS\/ATM system technical functions and performance standards for operation in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.  This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 50 AF weapon system program offices with resident CNS\/ATM technical expertise.\n\nThis funding enables the AMSD to monitor and participate in government and industry technical forums responsible for the development and assessment of international civil aviation standards for operations in worldwide airspace.  Division personnel analyze civil standards as they are being developed and work to influence them to support Department of Defense (DOD) interests.  CNS\/ATM experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria and document them in generic performance matrices (GPMs).  The COE works with MAJCOM and program office personnel to develop strategies for implementing CNS\/ATM requirements on AF weapon systems.  Specifically, CNS\/ATM experts work with program office systems engineers to tailor the GPMs to apply civil standards to each platform's unique avionics architecture.  Once CNS\/ATM component integration and testing is completed, COE personnel validate platform CNS\/ATM performance against the standards necessary to operate in civil airspace.  \n\nThe program office manages an Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that enables a centralized procurement of CNS\/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment. These contracts are used by aircraft program offices across the DOD, among other federal agencies, and in support of foreign military sales.\n\nThis program performs periodic audits required by civil aviation assurance standards on processes used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) to DOD users. This electronic navigation database, developed and maintained by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), contains critical safety of flight information used by DOD flight crews to fly instrument flight rules procedures worldwide.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

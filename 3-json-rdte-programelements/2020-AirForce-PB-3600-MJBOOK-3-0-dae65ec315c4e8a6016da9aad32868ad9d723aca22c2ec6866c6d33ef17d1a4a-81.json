Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) capability will transition to become the EGS command and control (C2) product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and resiliency in space program ground systems. The EGS capability will become the primary ground C2 system for Air Force Space Enterprise.\n\nThe main objective of EGS is to provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems. EGS will focus efforts on developing and integrating data centers in laboratories at three separate sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cybersecurity development and implementation. Programs and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats. Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.\n\nOver the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) EGS will be developing software applications and other services that support onboarding 23 missions covering the range of mission areas including Missile Warning, Missile Defense, MILSATCOM, Space Domain Awareness and other experimental satellites.  The modifications to core software applications provided by EGS will be made in an Agile DevSecOps environment which has and continues to be demonstrated through current EGS activities. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThe program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EGS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Leverage existing contracts in FY 2019 and continue consolidation of contracts into FY 2020.

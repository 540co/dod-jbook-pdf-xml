The Joint Concepts program supports the Chairman's statutory responsibility to provide \u201cbest military advice\u201d to the SECDEF and POTUS by expressing his vision for the future joint force; addressing operational problems on a 20 year horizon; identifying joint force development implications; and identifying capabilities required to mitigate and solve future joint warfighting gaps. The overarching goal is to enable investment decisions between near and far term. Concepts drive horizontal integration for force development across the Services, Combatant Commands, Defense agencies, OSD and Joint Staff. An intent of the Joint Concepts program is to support senior leader decisions in balancing today\u2019s requirements and future force requirements. Key deliverables include:  \n\nCapstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) that provides the Chairman's vision for the future joint operations and establishes aim points for the development of the future Joint Force. The key theme is globally integrated operations. \n\nFamily of Joint Concepts, based on National Military Strategy (NMS), provides operational approaches to future challenges or opportunities with respect to Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Countering Violent Extremist Organizations in order to guide current and future Joint Force development. \n\nJoint Concept Transition Plans, developed for each joint concept, document approaches for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) changes in the future Joint Force and identifies conceptual ideas that may require further exploration.  \n\nJoint Operating Environment (JOE) describes the future security environment and projects the implications of change for the Joint Force so it can anticipate and prepare for potential conflicts. The JOE articulates the circumstances that are likely to alter the security environment and explores how the intersection and interaction of these changes might impact the character of war in the future. Finally, the JOE provides a framework to think about the full range of Joint Force missions and how they may evolve over time.\n\nThe International Force Development Division\u2019s (IFDD) mission is to ensure collaboration and integration throughout the spectrum of joint force development, so that both the Joint Staff and its Allies and partners invest in any required reforms to ensure continued, interoperable and seamless operations together to meet the objectives in the NMS. The Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC) is an initiative led by the United States Joint Staff which partners with 22 countries and international organizations designed to develop and assess non-materiel force development solutions and close capability gaps in multinational operations. Funds are used solely for travel in support of U.S. led projects and events with multinational and coalition partners."

Also, the revised CCJO will identify force development implications and required capabilities to maintain U.S. competitive advantage against emerging threats out to 2035. In partnership with selected Combatant Commands and the Services, development of the Joint Operating Concepts to address strategic challenges has begun.  The Joint Operating Concept (JOC) \u2013 China and JOC - Russia prospectuses have been approved. The Director Joint Staff has endorsed the framework and authorized the continued development of two JOCs.  The initial research on JOC \u2013 North Korea has begun and the prospectus is expected to be approved in early FY 2018.  The concept prospectus describes the compelling military challenge and how it will be addressed in the future. JOC \u2013 Iran is in the very early stages of prospectus development. Study of the 2035 operating environment continues and informs understanding of military challenges associated with the common view of the future operating environment.  Work with Five Eyes (FVEY) countries is focused on developing a FVEY common view of the future operating environment.  Development support was completed for the Joint Concept for Integrated Campaigning and the Joint Concept for Operating in the Information Environment.  Concept implementation is underway for the Joint Concepts for rapid aggregation, robotic and autonomous systems, human aspects of military operations, access and maneuver in the global commons, preventing the transfer and use of weapons of mass Destruction, and operational contract support."

This complex and multi-variant task requires modernized technologies that provide integrated information linking authoritative force structure data (derived from the GFM DI Organizational Servers) to C2 data (resident in GFM mission applications). The Joint Staff Operations Directorate is responsible for GFM allocation and is the functional manager of the GFM mission applications. Accordingly, the Joint Staff will employ a strategy for efficiently fulfilling Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.\n\nThe DoD must quickly transition from legacy force management systems that promulgate data disparity across the Defense enterprise in order to meet national military objectives that have evolved from large force scenarios to operations that include small-to-full scale activities. As stated in both the NSS and NMS, our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic means. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to exchange information in a manner that keeps pace with globally changing threats to rapidly and accurately accomplish force sourcing activities to support SecDef allocation decisions. The Joint Staff is mandated to utilize the Service\u2019s Organizatonal Server EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces.

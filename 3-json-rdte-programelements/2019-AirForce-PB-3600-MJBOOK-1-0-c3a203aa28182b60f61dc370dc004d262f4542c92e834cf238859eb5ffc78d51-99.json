SMI (Project 657009: Space Mod Initiative): The primary objective is to enable and inform future decisions, and maintain and evolve a capable, resilient, and\naffordable OPIR architecture. This will be accomplished using maturing technologies and mitigating risk areas to modernize OPIR systems within the Department's\nconstrained resources. SMI supports the SBIRS Program of Record (PoR) by assessing future parts and material obsolescence, designing future space and ground\nmodifications focused on affordability and capability, and maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both\nproduction and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements, and technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology\nupgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture enhancements. SMI includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve\nthe current PoR constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded trade\nspace and improve the competitive environment. The three major thrust areas under SMI are Demonstrations, Technical Maturation and Data Exploitation.\nThe Demonstrations mature and demonstrate technologies in ground and on-orbit prototypes, advance system performance and algorithms for tactical and strategic\napplications to enhance PoR capabilities and reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the current PoR. Technology\nMaturation assesses needs to support resiliency of PoR assets and future architectures to be responsive to the evolving threat environment. Data Exploitation enables\naccess to OPIR data sources to expand technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to support warfighters and other data\nusers.\n\n2. Next-Gen OPIR-Ground (Project 657106: Evolved SBIRS): The Future Operational Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) will consist of Command and Control (C2) migration to Enterprise Ground Services (EGS), modernization of Mission Data Processing (MDP), and required development\/upgrades to Remote Ground Stations (RGS) to meet the current and future space domain demands. The FORGE effort will implement an open framework for MDP and migration of C2 satellite operations to integrate with EGS. FORGE and EGS efforts will provide the flexibility to integrate new MDP capabilities and more efficiently allow the system to meet evolving warfighter needs. The Next-Gen OPIR-Ground includes risk reduction efforts and cyber enhancements for the PoR and Next-Gen OPIR-Ground.\n\n3. Next-Gen OPIR-Space (Project 657120: Evolved SBIRS Space): The primary mission is to provide initial missile warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces and its allies. Next-Gen OPIR-Space enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. Development consists of the Next-Gen OPIR Polar and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites with new payloads in a highly resilient bus, providing real-time persistent global infrared coverage to meet the validated requirements based on Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) guidance on current and future space domain demands. \n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\"\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SMI and Next-Gen OPIR Ground and Space weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

This will be accomplished using maturing technologies and mitigating risk areas to modernize OPIR systems within the Department's constrained resources. SMI supports the SBIRS Program of Record (PoR) by assessing future parts and material obsolescence, designing future space and ground modifications focused on affordability and capability, and maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements, and technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture enhancements. SMI includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current PoR constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded trade space and improve the competitive environment. The three major thrust areas under SMI are Demonstrations, Technical Maturation and Data Exploitation."

The demonstrations explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem\/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture. The demonstrations support maturation of MDP algorithms for tactical and strategic applications which are critical efforts to enhance PoR capabilities and to reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the PoR.\n\nThe Wide Field Of View (WFOV) demonstration matures WFOV technology and validates multi-mission capabilities including the potential for a single sensor to simultaneously perform strategic and tactical missions. Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and to reduce risk for possible future architectures. The WFOV payload and bus are separate development efforts. The WFOV testbed program provides a bus capable of demonstrating on-orbit mission performance and mitigating the development risks for employing WFOV sensors. The testbed program includes contractual options to integrate, test, and launch prototype, developmental WFOV payloads with a government-owned free-flyer spacecraft or on a host government or commercially owned satellite. The WFOV Testbed will host the WFOV payload. As an integrated Space Vehicle, the WFOV system will prove on-orbit mission performance of WFOV sensors. The WFOV payload will provide the critical on-orbit data required to develop and validate WFOV algorithms, as well as on-board MDP throughput requirements for strategic missile warning. \n\nThe technology demonstration space vehicles under development are responsive to emerging stressing targets to the current missile warning architecture, as well as the rapidly evolving threats to the enterprise to inform the future OPIR architecture to include SBIRS, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other mission partners. The assets will be Class-C missions with a 3-5 year designed mission life and an initial launch capability beginning in 2024. The technology demonstrations will incorporate resiliency components and features while advancing the state of the art performance technology. The demonstrations will focus on the rapid acquisition, technology insertion, and launch of advanced missile warning technologies and system resiliency components. These assets will incorporate threat mitigation technologies and other resiliency features with the goal of demonstrating these technologies in ground and on-orbit. These demonstrations will facilitate tech insertion, validate technical performance, inform future OPIR requirements, and reduce technical risk to the enterprise."

SBIRS and other sensors provide a rich data set for exploitation. SMI data exploitation enables access to raw and processed data for data analysts and application developers to expand capabilities for battlespace awareness and other applications. SMI data exploitation efforts are complementary to, and enhance, the exploitation capabilities delivered by the PoR and inform future PoR exploitation efforts. SMI will develop tools and algorithms to enable users to apply OPIR data to support their mission needs. Data exploitation efforts also evaluate tools for C2, mission management, and MDP for risk reduction to evolve the PoR ground system to an open architecture that could support PoR and other future satellites and payload alternatives.

The program office will collaborate with appropriate contracting agencies to support each individual effort. Data exploitation efforts in the laboratory and the Battlespace Awareness center will leverage existing external contracts, as well as new internal competitive contracts. Activities, such as SBIRS obsolescence and affordability enhancements to the existing satellite design, will leverage existing Program of Record contracts. Technology maturation and component prototyping and\/or qualification could leverage existing contracts; in fact many are planned in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) and other government agencies. Where practical, other efforts could be competed. Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contractors will also be used to conduct and support studies. New technology, replacement components, and system designs will be acquired with government data rights to the maximum extent to allow their incorporation into any future OPIR satellite production or system development. Contracting partnerships with other agencies will also be used to study, develop, demonstrate and prove emerging capabilities."

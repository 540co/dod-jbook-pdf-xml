These payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. \n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical \/ Infrared \/ Laser Designator (EO\/IR\/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day\/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery and the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons. It is the EO\/IR\/LD sensor for the Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities. Current product improvements continue to focus on the development and implementation of Target Location Accuracy (TLA) and Tactical Awareness Improvement (TAI) capabilities that directly support emerging requirements of the Army's Current and Future Force.     \n\nSmall TActical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) provides the Gray Eagle UAS with multi-functional SAR\/MTI and Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) cross-cueing capabilities for the detection, classification and location of stationary and moving vehicle and man-sized targets.\n\nProject 11B: Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) provides the Gray Eagle UAS with radio frequency (RF) emitter detection, recognition, and geo-location capabilities.\n\nProject 123 Joint Technology Center System Integration: The UAS Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts. The JTC\/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises. The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE enhancements. This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP)."

The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in November 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. Full Rate Production (FRP) was achieved in June 2013. A three (3) year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform Research Development Technology & Evaluation (RDT&E) activities. The Enhanced EO\/IR Capability Production Document, approved 19 December 2016, defines additional KPP requirements for FMV sensors. The first KPP increases detection, recognition, and identification requirements which can only be met with the HD variation of the CSP. Currently, units are being fielded HD CSPs, with additional HD CSPs in production and retrofit. The second KPP requirement is for the CSP to be a metric sensor providing rapid and enhanced TLA. A five (5) year follow-on production and system support contract was awarded in 2019 for integration, test, upgrade, and sustainment of these enhanced capabilities. The FY 2021 acquisition strategy for CSP includes the continuation of developmental and operational  testing supporting CSP-TLA requirements and the maturation of hardware and software product improvements and prototype development supporting CSP-TAI requirements.\n\nSTARLite SAR\/MTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS. The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. FRP was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform. STARLite updated its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) results. This software update maximized user efficiency through automation of common tasks and upgraded to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE). The SPE software enhancements simplified user interface, reduced operator workload, and enhanced operator effectiveness. A competitive RDT&E funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and began the development of the software improvements. Integration onto the Gray Eagle was done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI."

This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE\/AFSERS Enhancements\n\nThe Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) is the DoD simulation\/training system for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), RPA, and ISR systems. MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force Application. The MUSE\/AFSERS is a software suite that simulates ISR & strike systems, tailored air vehicle & data links, and visualization systems used for payload product outputs-including Full Motion Video (FMV), Fixed Frame Imagery (FFI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data, and Link 16 (J2.2 and J3.5) tracking messages. Outputs are compliant with applicable DoD standards and are continually tested against actual ground ISR processors to ensure interoperability with over 40 systems within DoD.\n\nThe MUSE\/AFSERS creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) refinement, practice Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) of intelligence information, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize tactical operations within warfighting exercises and experiments.  MUSE\/AFSERS is currently in use across Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M\/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the MUSE\/AFSERS provides National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) images for associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of PED. The MUSE\/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations. Most of the components of the MUSE\/AFSERS software suite are also used in multiple UAS RPA system training devices including those for the RQ-7 [Shadow], MQ-1C [Gray Eagle], M\/RQ-5 [Hunter],  MQ-9 [Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical (MALET) JSIL Aircrew Trainer (MJAT)] and RQ-4 [Global Hawk Sensor Operator Part Task Trainer (GHSOPTT) and Global Hawk Weapon System Trainer (WST)].\n\nThis system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP)."

Continued improvement of mapping capability for mission planning.  Continued redesign of Windows Entity Server (WES) and NetLink to improve network routing and large PDU data feeds (i.e. ? 7 million+), thus lessening bandwidth consumption. Continued development of a Heads Up Display (HUD) designer application that will allow for the creation and modification of HUDs without having to touch the software baseline thereby reducing costs and increasing fidelity and speed of solution in theater. Continued implementation of generic 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) application that will allow for creation of new platforms without modifying code; again a reduction in costs and increased solution delivery velocity.

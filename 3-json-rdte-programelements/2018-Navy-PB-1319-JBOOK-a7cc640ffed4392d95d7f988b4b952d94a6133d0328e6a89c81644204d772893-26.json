The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) ONR Experimentation (OE) develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations; (3) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet\/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions; and (5) support for the Naval Precision Strike Operations, providing the Navy capability to quickly locate, target, and strike critical targets.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE. \n\nFY 2016 included a single year investment for the research in Directed Energy (Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation or SSL-TM) which explains the funding decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017. A new activity was moved into this PE in 2018 - Precision Strike Technology, formerly funded in PE 0603114N Power Projection Advanced Technology."

All SwampWorks activities are targeted towards advancing the capabilities of naval warfighters. Because of the portfolio's high-risk nature, brief exploratory studies can be performed to examine the maturation of the technology proposed before making substantial investments. The SwampWorks program has substantial flexibility in planning and execution which includes a streamlined approval process to allow for the shortest possible technology development timeframe. The balance of the S&T projects that will start in FY18 will be identified during FY18 as the needs of the warfighters, for investments in this portfolio, evolve or change. SwampWorks is not limited to any set of technology areas. The portfolio is open to great ideas all year long and invests in innovative technology development that will ultimately provide a dramatic improvement for the warfighter."

The performance of the work funded in this PE is reviewed at several levels to ensure that the investment is relevant and productive.  At the macroscopic level, the investment is coordinated with Navy Warfare Development Command and Commander, Fleet Forces Command to address the goals and objectives identified for sea trials and Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs).  At the microscopic level, the work funded in this PE is reviewed periodically by the Program Manager to ensure the investment is meeting the goals defined for each project. This review includes feedback collected from the warfighter community on all sea trials and LOEs to support the Program Manager's assessment of the value and relevance of each investment. Furthermore, the entire program is reviewed yearly by the Chief of Naval Research."

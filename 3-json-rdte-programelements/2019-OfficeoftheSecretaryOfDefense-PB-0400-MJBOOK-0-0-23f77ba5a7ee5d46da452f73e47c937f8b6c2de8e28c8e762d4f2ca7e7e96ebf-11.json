FCT\u2019s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries enables development of innovative, cost effective, and interoperable solutions for the Department of Defense (DoD), Multi-Service and Combatant Command (CCMD) priority requirements. FCT also increases competition, ensuring our personnel have access to the best technology available.\n\nService Requirements Review Board (SRRB) efficiencies are included."

            "val": "The FCT program supports the warfighter by leveraging technologies and equipment developed by allied nations and coalition partners to counter emerging threats, thereby enhancing U.S. warfighting capabilities while lowering U.S. development costs and accelerating the DoD acquisition process. FCT supports DoD best practices by incentivizing the use of prototyping and experimentation in advancing technological solutions to warfighter problems and acts as a hedge against threat developments. FCT enhances interoperability, facilitates international collaboration, increases competition, and enables more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record. Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Emerging Capability & Prototyping (DASD(EC&P)), Comparative Technology Office (CTO). FCT projects are sponsored by the Military Services and USSOCOM. Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements and DoD priorities, a thorough market survey, and an emphasis on transitioning technologies into current or future programs of record.\n\nThe FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries. Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of a qualified foreign item in the United States. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. Defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement. The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States. To date, companies from 34 states benefited from FCT projects."

This testing will provide valuable insight into the potential benefits of using these signals in a U.S. military environment. Differences in positioning and timing between the foreign GNSS receiver and the platform's principal military GPS receiver may indicate to the platform that it should select an alternate, non-satellite navigation source. Completed anechoic chamber test equipment modifications and initiated final testing in FY 2017. Although this project did not meet the one million dollar threshold, it was included in this section because of a large investment in FY 2016."

The program develops and improves manufacturing technologies and processes to enable cost reduction, improve component and system quality, and enhance industrial capability.  Value stream modifications and manufacturing throughput improvements are effected to shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production and sustainment.  Manufacturing Technologies objectives are conducted through industrial partnerships which enable the demonstration of manufacturing technologies for existing weapon system upgrades and\/or for new warfighter systems.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602601F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

On June 23, 2015, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) notified Congress of the forthcoming transfer of $5.030 billion to federal agencies with systems affected by the AWS-3 transition. Following the conclusion of the 30-day statutory waiting period, OMB transferred the funds to the federal agencies. \n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) received $3.500 billion of the auction proceeds and created a $500 million Spectrum Access Research and Development Program (SAR&DP) to investigate new DoD technologies. The SAR&DP encompasses spectrum technology development that enables the DoD to perform its missions using spectrum-dependent systems in a manner that preferably enhances operational readiness and capability. Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for pursued technology solutions. DoD's transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are sufficiently resilient (survivable and electronically protected) to operate in both the United States and congested\/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed.\n\nThis program represents the Air Force investment within the SAR&DP.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

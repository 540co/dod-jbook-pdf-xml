            "val": "The Cyber Resiliency of Weapon Systems (CRWS) for Agile Combat Support (ACS) provides funding to increase weapon systems cyber resiliency\/security in all phases and activities of the acquisition life cycle by accomplishing two goals. First, CRWS integrates cyber resiliency design tenets into the systems engineering process and builds cyber resiliency into weapon systems. Second, CRWS assesses and enables modifications of fielded systems to protect them from cyber exploitation.\nTo meet these goals, this effort addresses cyber resiliency and security gaps in five projects. The first project increases cyber security and resiliency skills, knowledge, and experience of acquisitions personnel. The second project prototypes, evaluates, and transitions cyber secure and resilient risk-informed processes, tools, products, and policies into all phases of the acquisition life cycle and sustainment. The third project develops standards for designing new weapon systems by defining a government reference architecture, providing the capability to rapidly update weapon systems cyber components in response to new cyber threats, and allowing future weapon system designers the opportunity to use open system architectures. The fourth project addresses the security and resiliency of fielded weapons systems by designing mitigations strategies and prototyping solutions for known vulnerabilities.  The final project systematically reviews Air Force weapons systems' mission sets and addresses gaps in mission assurance (such as a weapon system's critical subsystem and support systems) due to evolving cyber threats.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CRWS capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

This effort also identifies mitigations to high risk cyber vulnerabilities and recommends a transition path on the fielded weapon systems, subsystems, and support systems. Activities in this project include: 1) the investigation and identification of changes to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and 2) the investigation and prototyping of engineering solutions not effectively mitigated by TTPs to transfer to the program offices for development on their weapon systems, subsystems, and support systems.  This project addresses the gap between the cyber security\/resiliency that has been accomplished on traditional internet protocol (IP)-based Information Technology (IT) for the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) and lack of focused effort of cyber security\/resiliency on non-DODIN IT plus non-IP based technologies typically found on fielded weapon systems, subsystems, and support systems."

Activities include investigating existing methodologies, prototyping an analytical process, prototyping software support tools, and building upon that to institutionalize CMTA in our acquisition processes.  These activities will provide a common, repeatable, mission level cyber analytical methodology.  Each CMTA will identify the functions performed, participating systems, and top level interactions among all relevant participants from the user's point of view.  By understanding operational intent, mission dependencies, and the cyber risk landscape, operational and technology experts from various disciplines including acquisition, development, operational support, and sustainment can make objective statements about mission impact and task outcomes, as well as assess potential mitigations."

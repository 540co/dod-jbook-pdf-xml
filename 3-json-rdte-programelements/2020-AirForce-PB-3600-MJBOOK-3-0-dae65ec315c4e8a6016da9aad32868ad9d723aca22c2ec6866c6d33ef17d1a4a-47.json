This program is part of the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program. BAO Kit will develop, test, train, and modernize the existing and future Family of Systems (FoS) that provide a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability. It also provides a suite of systems for all Air Force Specialty Codes supporting the ST community within the Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in ST System Development focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through three core capabilities, which are not limited to: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, medical monitoring, and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) C4ISR System and all other ST capability needs.\n\nThis program will develop and enhance technologies for Battlefield Airmen ST operators to recognize, identify, range, nominate, and designate targets during both day and night operations. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, track, fix targets, and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre- and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. BAO Kit systems are light, compact, and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. FY20 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness, and precision lethality in the battle space while continuing to build and enhance the BAO Kit family of systems. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes, and associated engineering support to posture the BAO Kit for technology insertion.  These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increase mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. BAO also supports AFSOC Tactical Command and Control (TAC C2) programs to develop and enhance communications systems and equipment essential for ST combat controllers, pararescue, combat weather operators, and tactical air controller parties within AFSOC to perform their mission. The ST operators use this equipment to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield\/assault landing\/drop zone operations. Due to the rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements. The above efforts may change based on the need to support current Air Force mission requirements.  \n\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver special tactic capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nThe Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies, analysis, and risk-reduction activities to support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This modernized application will subsume outdated Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) that are not financially compliant and integrate numerous local supply and logistics databases into a single, enterprise-wide authoritative system. GCSS-Army will be financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise strategy to be financially auditable. When fully deployed, GCSS-Army will affect every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, Logistics Readiness Centers (LRCs) and property book office in the Army.\nGCSS-Army will modernize automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, and tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  Delivering GCSS-Army will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems that are not cyber compliant, resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system."

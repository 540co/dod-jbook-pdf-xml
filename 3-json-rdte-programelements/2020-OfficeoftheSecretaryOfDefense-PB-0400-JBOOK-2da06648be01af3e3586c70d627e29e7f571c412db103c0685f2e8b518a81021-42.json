In order to carry out the important effort initiated by Missile Defeat, the FY 2020 request will continue to create advanced capability for the defeat of time sensitive targets.  Activities will be coordinated with the Services, appropriate Agencies and the Combatant Commands to transition these developments into viable warfighting capabilities.  The Department is reviewing options to re-title this program element or transfer the remaining resources in to another program element to continuee work on time sensitive targets."

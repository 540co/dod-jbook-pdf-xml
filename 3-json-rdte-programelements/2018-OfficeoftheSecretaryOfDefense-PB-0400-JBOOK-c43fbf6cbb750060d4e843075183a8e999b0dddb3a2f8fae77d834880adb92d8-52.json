As with the FY 2015 programs, FY 2016 feasibility studies will define the required actions for incorporating DEF into programs, begin DEF designs on select designated programs, and assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&L) will continue to engage with program offices through the Military Department DEF POCs, and serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other defense agencies to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A and B systems, OUSD(AT&L)\/IC will ensure the DEF feasibility studies are addressed in their program Acquisition Strategies and Program Protection Plans (PPP).  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies were executed."

As with the FY 2016 programs, FY 2017 feasibility studies will define the required actions for incorporating DEF into programs, begin DEF designs on select designated programs, and assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&L) will continue to engage with program offices through the Military Department DEF POCs, and serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other defense agencies to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A and B systems, OUSD(AT&L)\/IC will ensure the DEF feasibility studies are addressed in their program Acquisition Strategies and Program Protection Plans (PPP).  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies were executed."

LAA executes under a middle tier rapid fielding acquisition strategy pursuant to Section 804 of the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act. The LAA option offers flexibility and accelerates modernization of current and potential partner forces who do not require advanced fighter aircraft. The LAA effort supports the National Defense Strategy to counter violent extremism on a global scale, alongside allies and partners.\n\nLAA squadrons will provide a deployable and sustainable multirole attack capability, capable of performing a diverse array of attack missions, including but not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Armed Reconnaissance, Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR), Airborne Forward Air control (FAC-A), and Interdiction. Other tasks for which Light Attack aircraft is expected to be suitable include Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Rescue Escort (RESCORT), and Maritime Air Support (MAS). LAA squadrons executing these tasks allows our 4th and 5th Generation fighter fleets to implement a tailored training regimen to address declining core mission readiness and focus on preparing to deter or prevail in conflicts with peer adversaries. LAA will provide a deployable, persistent attack capability that can be employed with low footprint and light logistical support requirements.\n\nThe effort will experiment with additional aircraft and weapon technologies; tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and Joint Terminal Attack Controller training, as well as development of operational tactics of an exportable network with international partners.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver light attack capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

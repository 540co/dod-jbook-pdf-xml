            "val": "The Combat Identification (CID) Technology program element analyzes, develops, demonstrates and evaluates promising target identification technologies to facilitate platform transition decisions prior to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).  The Joint Capability Document (JCD) for CID BFT (Blue Force Tracking), operational documents, lessons learned, and NATO requirements state the need for positive CID.  High confidence CID increases combat effectiveness, prevents fratricide, and reduces collateral damage.  It also enables combatant commanders to effectively command and control their forces in all weather, day or night.  This program element focuses on the cooperative and non-cooperative technologies that have the capability to positively identify surface and air targets in both air-to-surface and air-to-air engagements.  \n\nIn order to rapidly make available promising CID technologies for platform EMD decisions, the program element funds design studies, engineering analysis, and other efforts associated with demonstration of prototype CID related technologies and subsystems on platforms.  It also supports the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, Allied, and coalition interoperability.  \n\nNon-cooperative CID employs a number of sensing technologies and signal processing techniques. The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms. These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision, an Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) imaging system that significantly increases ID ranges; (2) Hydra Vision, a balanced (robust) amalgamation of sensor data from multiple sources to provide warfighters with higher confidence CID results on surface or air targets potentially including fusion with intelligence sources, identification of non-traditional targets, fusion to counter camouflage, concealment and deception (CCD), and multi-phenomenology features for sustainable databases; (3) Compact AiTR (Aided Target Recognition) and Sustainable Environments (CASE), a CID approach that focuses on tailoring algorithms to utilize smaller, more efficient databases that are faster and less expensive to generate and maintain; (4) Passive RF ID Environment (PRIDE), a program to develop passive RF target ID capability for denied access environment utilizing passive RF and EW information with potential non-traditional ISR capabilities; (5) Radio ID (RID) will develop methods for utilizing advances in digital radio technologies such as software defined radios, to provide low cost ID solutions to enhance Combat ID, improve aircrew situational awareness and assist in fratricide prevention with military and civil air platforms, potentially fusing non-cooperative techniques and cooperative technologies; and (6) Enhanced Combat ID (ECID), a program under Studies to develop a robust ability to quantitatively evaluate promising CID technologies using enhanced modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities.  \n\nCooperative CID employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifying an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative ID capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) as well as Mode 5 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nFund Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XIIA System (AIMS)Program Office test engineers.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability testing and certification responsibilities for the present Mark XII system, development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems.  AIMS PO will continue to test and certify IFF equipment for the services now as long as IFF is used for combat identification.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

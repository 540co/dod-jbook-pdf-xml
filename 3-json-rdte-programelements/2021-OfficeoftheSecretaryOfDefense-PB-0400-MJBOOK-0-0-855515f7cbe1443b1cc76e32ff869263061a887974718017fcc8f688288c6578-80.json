            "val": "This Program Element provides funding to support efforts to maintain DoD's technology advantage.  The targeting of U.S. capabilities by our strategic competitors create the potential to degrade core U.S. military technological advantages through unwanted technology transfer.  The technology transfer, primarily unclassified technology, threatens DoD's ability to maintain the technology advantage required to support the lethality and survivability of the Joint Force.  DoD is executing a campaign plan to maintain DoD's technology advantage.  First, DoD is promoting strategic technology investment to provide DoD access to new and innovative technology.  These investments are required to create breakthroughs in key areas of basic research, foster transition and decrease time to market of applied research to economically viable companies, and harvest U.S. innovation or with likeminded allies.  \n\nSecondly, DoD must ensure its strategic technology investments are protected against unwanted technology transfer by developing and maintaining the tools and techniques that enable the U.S. engage in technology transfer at the time, place, and parties of our choosing.  \n\nThirdly, DoD must combat adversaries' attempts to thwart U.S. technology security mechanisms to control technology transfer.  The Department will support these three efforts by developing the appropriate suite of analytic tools, a data acquisition strategy, and utilize program protection activities to address the threat over the long term.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific RDA practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor networks; improve mitigation of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, mature processes to identify Critical Program Information integration of defense exportability features and improve program protection planning."

Program Protection Planning includes protection of classified and unclassified controlled technical information, critical program information, critical components and critical mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition and S&T practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor information networks; improve mitigation and management of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, improve software assurance practices, mature processes to identify and protect Critical Program Information and improve program protection planning.  Activities carried out, support implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology; implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.39  Critical Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to identify and protect Critical Program Information; and implementation of DoD Instruction 8582.01 Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems for Safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor owned networks."

This project provides support to technology priority leaders in identifying innovation base needs; characterizing and assessing priority technology areas, identifying and mitigating risks impacting the innovation base, and exploiting opportunities to advance technology development, testing, and manufacturing.  One of TIB\u2019s main objectives is to create balance between promotion of the innovation base while protecting the technology from interference or exploitation by competitors..  This balance will aid the Department\u2019s advancing critical and emergent technologies ahead of competitor nations and actors while sustaining a healthy, resilient, and globally competitive innovation base.  This portfolio of activity extends efforts initiated in response to FY19 NDAA Section 1793.\n\nThis project uses a three-step approach: (1) Assess, (2) Protect\/Promote; and (3) Monitor.  In the first step, TIB uses emerging technology assessments to translate technology requirements to manufacturing and innovation base requirements in order to identify innovation base issues, risks, and opportunities.  TIB created an assessment methodology that incorporates four types of studies to provide a full overview of the technology from a manufacturing and innovation base point of view.  The results of the assessments are used to create technology and innovation base protection and promotion strategies (second step of the approach). TIB leverages DoD and Federal Government tools and initiatives to implement the strategies.   In the third step, TIB uses data analytics to measure the success of mitigation and exploitation strategies, establish trends in the markets, and identify the need for additional assessments or changes in the strategies.  For technology protection, TIB manages the OUSD(R&E) responsibilities for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews.  TIB does the initial screening of all CFIUS cases to determine R&E equities and request R&E subject matter experts review in foreign acquisition transactions with a potential negative impact to national security.  TIB is the focal point for all R&E stakeholders and the link between the organization and the rest of the DoD stakeholders."

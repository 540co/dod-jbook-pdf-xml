The HD R&D Program accomplishes the GCC support by utilizing host nation demining partners to evaluate technology in actual minefields to simultaneously achieve HMA objectives and identify performance parameters; data is delivered to the US military countermine R&D programs to inform future investment decisions.  In addition to the improvements made to technologies used by U.S. forces and to the reduction of landmine and UXO threat to US forces and host nation population, the Program\u2019s technology trainings and evaluations build mine action capacity and capability within mine-affected countries and improve safety, stability and economic development. \n\nSince 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 199 evaluations in 39 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Zimbabwe.  The program\u2019s technologies have cleared 42 million square meters of the world\u2019s toughest minefields; and found or destroyed 177,000 mines and UXO.\n\nNew technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop and a biennial UXO Working Group Meeting held by OASD SO\/LIC.  The meetings involve representatives from Department of State (DOS), GCC Humanitarian Mine Action offices, mine action organizations and mine-affected nations.  The program element\u2019s work fulfills the Department of Defense\u2019s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with \u00a7 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance."

Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is necessary, but not sufficient, for pursued technology solutions. The Department of Defense transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are effective (for example, survivable, electronically protected, et cetera) while operating in both the United States and congested\/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed.\n\nThis program represents the Air Force investment within the SAR&DP. Budget for the Air Force portion of the DoD SAR&DP is created from the auction of Advanced Wireless Service licenses in execution year.\n\nFunding supports Spectrum relocation and sharing activities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is necessary, but not sufficient, for pursued technology solutions. The Department of Defense transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are effective (for example, survivable, electronically protected, et cetera) while operating in both the United States and congested\/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed."

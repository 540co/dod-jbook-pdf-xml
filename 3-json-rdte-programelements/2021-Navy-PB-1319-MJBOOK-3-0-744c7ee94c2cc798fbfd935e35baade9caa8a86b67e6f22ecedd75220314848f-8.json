There are a number of ways in which the actual transfer may take place,. Technology Transfer Offices to enhance U.S. naval forces effectiveness by strategically leveraging industrial and academic research and development partnerships for modernization. These partnerships transition private sector technology into the NRE, and transfer appropriate Navy-developed innovative concepts, inventions, facilities and materiel to the private sector for the purposes of dual-use commercialization, to benefit DoD, the public economy, and academia.

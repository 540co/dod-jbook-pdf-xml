With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research program element (PE) develops and evaluates the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts, with the potential to improve future DoD systems.  The SEI\u2019s program of work is coordinated across the DoD through Reliance 21, the overarching framework of the DoD\u2019s Science & Technology (S&T) joint planning and coordination process.  This PE benefits every Community of Interest due to the ubiquitous nature of software, but particularly benefits: Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) which includes a computing and software sub-panel; Autonomy; Cyber; and Engineered Resilient Systems.  \n\nWork conducted under this PE will enable resilient mission assurance in heterogeneous and contested environments through the verification and validation of system performance and architecture. The program will also assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage in the areas of software-intensive systems and cybersecurity by enhancing assurance, exploiting automation, and understanding human-computer interaction."

Example activities include automation of moving target defenses, code artifact reverse engineering, analysis of network flows at enterprise scale, and development and assessment of workforce skills."

It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations to provide direct command and control to all air assets in an assigned Area of Responsibility (AOR) and to report back to the Joint Force Air Combat Commander (JFACC). The CRC is a family of systems which include: AN\/TYQ-23A(V)1 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), AN\/TSC-147 Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Module (JM) (to be replaced by Link 16 Upgrade) Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS), AN\/TRC-213\/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS), and the AN\/TPS-75 Radar, CRC\u2019s organic radar, which will be replaced by the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR) (PE0207455). Air Combat Command (ACC) CRC Capability Roadmap provides for the modernization of this family of systems and will be programmed into phased updates through 2037.\n\nCRC begins its Phase 1 Modernization effort in FY17.  Phase 1 addresses, but is not limited to, AN\/TYQ-23A(V)1 OM Increment 1 (Multiple Source Correlator Tracker (MSCT) software upgrades, 3DELRR Integration and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet) integration), JM Link 16 upgrade and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS). \n\nIn FY17, OM Mod Increment 1 was a new start.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The program focuses on technical and operational issues of specific Navy interest, where there are no unbiased test validated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) solutions available, and where timely capabilities may not materialize without specific demonstration or validation by the Navy. Additionally, the program completes the development of technologies originating from Navy, DOD and other sources of Science and Technology programs, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Department of Energy (DOE). Validated technologies are implemented in the Navy's Military Construction (MILCON) and Facilities, Sustainment Restoration and Modernization (FSRM) program, and Antiterrorism and Force Protection (ATFP) Other Procurement, Navy (OP,N) program. \n\nProject 0995 addresses the following Navy facilities requirements during FY 2014 through FY 2020: Advance Technology for Waterfront Facilities Repair and Enhancements, Facilities Technologies to Reduce the Cost of Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization for reducing the total ownership cost (TOC) of future and existing Facilities and addressing natural and catastrophic risk of critical Naval Waterfront Facilities. \n\nForce Protection Ashore Project 3155 addresses selective topics in modeling, and material technologies to reduce the vulnerability of installations; and reduce the acquisition and operating costs of protective technologies. The demonstrations and validations provide the independent, technical and operational test data for the development of competitive performance specifications to acquire the required capabilities. The ATFP project is coordinated with other DOD programs.\n\nProject 3347: The Development of advanced Environmental Control Unit (ECU) for expeditionary force camp shelters project is a transition of a DOE FY12-14 funded project and is a continuation in technology development, and was transitioned to NAVFAC starting FY 2015."

The program focuses available RDT&E resources on satisfying facility requirements where the Navy is a major stakeholder or where there are no tested validated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) solutions available, and a timely solution will not emerge without a Navy sponsored demonstration and validation. The program completes the development and validation of facility technologies originating in Navy science and technology programs, plus a variety of other sources which includes the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This program introduces the idea of resilient facilities and infrastructure thru hardening, rapid assessment, and recovery. Validated technologies are implemented in the Navy's Military Construction (MILCON) and Facilities Sustainment Restoration and Modernization Programs (FSRM). The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009 laid down very specific guidelines for the correction of corrosion deficiencies in DoD shore facilities which is estimated to be $1.9B (DOD Annual Cost of Corrosion for the Department of Defense Facilities and Infrastructure July 2010).\n\nProject 0995 addresses two Navy facilities requirements: 1) waterfront facilities repair, upgrade and service life extension; and, 2) validation testing\/performance monitoring of critical facilities (such as dry docks, piers, runways, magazines, etc.), testing and evaluation of the performance of alternative materials, and surfacing concepts, and, methods and corrosion technologies to reduce the cost of Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM).\n\nWaterfront facilities, repair, upgrade and service life extension:\nAn urgent requirement exists for early identification of strategies and solution recommendations for seismic risk at Naval Facilities, and especially nuclear capable waterfront facilities. Recent Pacific Rim earthquakes have heightened anxiety levels on perceived huge risks to Navy waterfront facilities in the region. The sub-project will provide analysis and solution recommendations for facilities impacted by seismic risk. Waterfront facilities repair and upgrade: About 75% of the Navy's waterfront facilities are over 45 years old. They were designed for a service life of 25 years which was to satisfy the mission requirements existing at that time. The over aged reinforced concrete requires costly and repetitive repairs. Besides providing more pier side ship maintenance and thus reduce dry dock costs, these piers must be strengthened to support concentrated crane loads up to 140 tons when piers were originally not designed for concentrated loads. Piers were previously designed to service one or possibly two particular ship classes. Berthing flexibility is now limited by mooring and utility arrangements. This sub-project addresses new material design methods, and retrofit methods which extends the service life of existing waterfront facilities by an additional 15 or more years. The project also addresses updating the mission based service, environmental, and protection loading requirements imposed by changes in platforms, operations and threats. Other initiatives include: leveraging Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology to provide for enhanced facilities management processes and waterfront utilities service enhancements using models to achieve flexible berthing arrangements consistent with current and future platform mooring configurations and hotel service requirements including Facilities and Infrastructure Integrated Product Support for Acquisition Category (ACAT) Programs.\n\nTechnologies to reduce the cost of Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM):\nTechnologies to reduce the cost of SRM issues of high operational significance are addressed on a priority basis. The Navy portion of corrosion deficiencies at DoD shore facilities is estimated to be $433M (DOD Annual Cost of Corrosion for the Department of Defense Facilities and Infrastructure July 2010). This effort will demonstrate and validate the cost and reliability of advanced corrosion technologies in order to assure their acceptance and implementation in traditionally conservative public works and construction industries. These facility corrosion technologies will accelerate the validation commercialization, and wide-spread implementation required to reduce the cost of correcting, the deficiencies in the Navy SRM backlog. The sub-projects include the continuing effort to validate, test and conduct performance monitoring of enhanced facility designs and coatings for facilities and equipment."

                            "val": "Protection of Navy installations against terrorist activities requires deployment of advanced technology for force protection capabilities. This antiterrorism and force protection (AT\/FP) ashore project will develop, demonstrate and validate technologies for the following: access control and integrated perimeter security surveillance sensors and intelligent electronic security systems for automated intruder detection (Installation Protection); perimeter security; waterside protection against craft and swimmer intrusion; secure and efficient operations centers and emergency management centers including human and information support systems (Command and Control). Programs currently being evaluated are, standard-based enterprise physical security system integration and automation; Command, Control, and Communications (C3) capabilities for emergency operations; integrated and networked mass notification systems (MNS); Waterside intelligent video security systems; integrated over-the-water sensors and analytics for automated course of action planning; identifying and interdicting malevolent threats - watercraft, swimmers, divers, and unmanned underwater vessels (UUVs) to reduce injury and death to the warfighter and damage to high value units (HVUs)(Waterside Protection). Through demonstration and validation of risk modeling and simulation models, the potential of emerging technologies will be evaluated and installation security strategies that reduce manpower and other costs will be formulated. Multiple systems with sensors and cameras are being deployed on Navy installations to be used for threat\nassessment. These systems are not integrated and there is not a centralized location or system that all the data can be analyzed. The Sensor Assessment Cell (SAC) brings all these sensor feeds into one location and the Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) software provides an integrated picture so that an intelligent assessment can be made. Current AT\/FP systems to be integrated include Automated Vehicle Gates (AVG), Regional Alarms\/Local Alarms (AMAS), Navy Munition Command enclave (NMC), and Electronic Harbor Security System. These demonstrations and validations derive advanced technology from science and technology programs of government academia and industry. The technology evaluation and validation produces data for performance specifications used for competitive procurement. All work will be coordinated with other programs and through industry forums as appropriate."

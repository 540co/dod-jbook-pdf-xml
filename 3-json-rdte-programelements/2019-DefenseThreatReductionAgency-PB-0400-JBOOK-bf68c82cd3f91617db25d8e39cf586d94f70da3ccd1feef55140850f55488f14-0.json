It provides for the discovery and development of basic knowledge by research performers from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry. This investment helps motivate the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions, advancing the body of CWMD knowledge, and improving knowledge of research efforts that support nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management. These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA\u2019s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a basic research portfolio under DoD\u2019s Chemical and Biological Defense Program. \n\nEach year, program and technical managers conduct formal assessments of the portfolio, leveraging deep Science and Technology (S&T) expertise within DTRA, as well as from the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group, independent external panel reviews, and other CWMD-focused stakeholders. This coordination facilitates unique, CWMD-relevant basic research while eliminating unintended duplication of effort in the broader defense S&T community."

This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA\u2019s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.  \n\nThis project aligns with DTRA\u2019s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.  The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers.  Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  \n\nThis project solicits, coordinates, and conducts research to build a robust, forward-looking fundamental research portfolio targeting strategic, mission-focused, basic research with high potential impact for CWMD.  The research projects are selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation.  Each individual research project offers opportunities to expand the knowledge base to help the warfighter, to bring to bear new science solutions with a fresh approach, or to leverage revolutionary approaches to technical surprise, building a foundation for future CWMD solutions.  This research will enable new capabilities to: better understand the environment, threats and vulnerabilities; control, defeat, disable, and\/or dispose of WMD threats; and safeguard the force by managing consequences.  Each program manager's portfolio leverages a wide range of scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, information and network sciences and focuses basic research on the CWMD mission."

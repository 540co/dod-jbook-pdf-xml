Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIUx is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include \u201cnon-traditional\u201d companies that never imagined the military as a potential customer, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their tremendous talents on the vital and difficult mission of our nation\u2019s defense."

In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the operational control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) with a functional realignment of $148.8 million across the FYDP to WHS.\n\nDIUx funds the acquisition and\/or prototyping of leading-edge technologies from commercially-focused companies (i.e., \u201cnon-traditionals\u201d) from Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and across the country; as well as from traditional defense contractors that either partner with non-traditionals or offer one-third in cost sharing.  DIUx acquires and\/or prototypes these commercially viable technologies solutions, in direct response to particular capability gaps faced by our nation\u2019s warfighters.  As such, solution proposals are assessed to ensure alignment with DoD\u2019s strategic objectives to increase and strengthen our nation\u2019s security."

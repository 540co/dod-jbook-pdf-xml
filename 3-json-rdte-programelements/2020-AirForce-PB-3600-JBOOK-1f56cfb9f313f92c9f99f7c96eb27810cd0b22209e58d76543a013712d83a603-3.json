Based on existing technological capabilities, WAS will detect\/track low, slow and other asymmetrical threats in the airspace and meet the user needs of sensing stressing airborne targets in complex environments with affordable sensors. The sensor outputs will be incorporated into the Battle Control Systems-Fixed\n(BCS-F) air picture and utilized as the North American Aerospace Defense Command\/ Northern Command (NORAD\/NORTHCOM) Command and Control (C2) air surveillance system of record.\n\nSome aspects of the WAS program are classified and will be provided on a need-to-know basis.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WAS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

A subsequent task order was awarded (Jul 17) to include pre-operational site support. The ongoing CPFF contract for Scorpion was awarded (Aug 17) to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and testing of the Scorpion system, and conduct pre-operational site support. This strategy includes a single delivery approach with 11 STARS and 18 Scorpion systems for a total of 29  sub-systems delivered to achieve FOC. The pre-operational contract for the Scorpion system transitioned to Interim Contract Support (ICS) in Dec 2018, STARS system will award ICS in conjunction with production contracts in FY19.  \n\nAir Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO BM) is the PEO for WAS.

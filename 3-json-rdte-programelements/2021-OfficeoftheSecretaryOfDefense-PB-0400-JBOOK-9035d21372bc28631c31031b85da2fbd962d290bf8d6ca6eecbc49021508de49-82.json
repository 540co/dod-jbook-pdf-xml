Specific responsibilities are outlined in DoDI 5134.17 Change 3 dated October 15, 2018.  The Director, Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)); and the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) on Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E) in the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nProgram Element 0605804D8Z supports the three strategic lines of effort within the National Defense Strategy (NDS).  The Office of the USD(R&E) (OUSD(R&E) engages with acquisition and rapid prototype programs to provide test planning expertise, including cybersecurity DT&E, and decision-quality data at major program reviews to help them succeed in modernizing key capabilities to Build a More Lethal Force.  OUSD(R&E) serves as the T&E acquisition career field Functional Leader to enhance the experience and qualification of the 8,700+ member DoD T&E workforce to Cultivate Workforce Talent and support priority emerging technologies.  OUSD(R&E) ensures programs meet interoperability requirements to deepen interoperability and Strengthen Alliances.  The PE also works to streamline T&E policy and guidance to improve test efficiency, and reduce acquisition cost and schedule to Reform the Department for Greater Performance and Affordability.\n\nProgram Element (PE) 0605804D8Z supports and improves the DT&E efforts of Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), Major Automated Information System (MAIS) \/ Priority Defense Business Systems, Rapid Prototyping\/Fielding efforts, and other Special Interest (SI) acquisition programs designated by USD(R&E) or USD(A&S) as they progress through the acquisition\/development lifecycle; lead the defense acquisition workforce Test and Evaluation (T&E) career field; and support development of policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&E within the DoD.  Beginning in FY 2021, OUSD(R&E) established project 048, \u201cCybersecurity DT&E for Weapon Systems\u201d, to provide dedicated resources to support MDAP and Rapid Prototyping\/Fielding Program Managers, Chief Developmental Testers, and Lead DT&E Organizations in the development of comprehensive, efficient, and innovative Cybersecurity DT&E strategies\/plans to support key acquisition milestones and engineering\/programmatic decisions."

This project also supports the OUSD(R&E) to manage the Test & Evaluation (T&E) career field and curriculum for the DoD acquisition workforce, and develop policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&E within DoD.  On behalf of the OUSD(R&E) this project executes the following activities:\n\n- Support acquisition programs in the development of comprehensive, efficient, and innovative test strategies.  Ensure that developmental test strategies are documented in Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  Review and approve\/disapprove the DT&E strategy\/plans within the TEMP.\n- Support rapid prototyping, rapid fielding, and technology demonstrations efforts in the development of tailored comprehensive, efficient, and innovative DT&E strategies\/plans.\n- Review and oversee developmental test processes across the services, especially during the formative stages of programs, to include prototyping and experimentation.\n- Provide DT&E subject matter experts to assist programs in building Developmental Evaluation Frameworks (DEFs) for inclusion in the TEMP.\n- Provide cybersecurity subject matter experts and assist programs in conducting Cybersecurity Table Top Exercises to identify potential threat vectors and associated risks early in development and focus Cybersecurity DT&E efforts (In FY 2021, this effort will move to Project 048).\n- For ACAT ID programs, provide independent DT&E Sufficiency Assessments prior to Milestone B and C decisions with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle.\n- When requested by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense, provide independent developmental test assessments in support of USD(A&S) and Service Major Defense Acquisition Programs.\n- Support the development of independent technical risk assessments and advise the Secretary on the progress toward meeting Key Performance Parameters, technology maturation, reliability growth projections, interoperability, and cybersecurity posture before any decision to grant Milestone A or B approval, or enter into low-rate initial production or full-rate production for ACAT ID programs or when requested by the Secretary.\n- Serve as the Functional Leader for the T&E acquisition career field.  Support OUSD(R&E) to establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training, and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance the T&E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training.\n- Manage the Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE).  Over the last four years, the STAT COE has supported over 40 Acquisition Program Managers in the development of statistically optimized test programs.  These efforts have resulted in 175 more efficient and effective test plans and a test cost avoidance of about $160.000 million.\n- Support OUSD(R&E) to develop policy and guidance that ensures efficient and effective DT&E across the DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and cybersecurity in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).\n- Identify DoD test infrastructure gaps and support development of the OUSD(R&E) test resources strategic plan.\n- Ensure that the DT&E activities are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the DoD Systems Engineering and development planning processes.\n- Evolve the DT&E 'state of practice' to keep pace with emerging technologies and improve test efficiency to field systems faster.\n- Coordinate with Director, Operational Test and Evaluation to improve T&E efficiency and make best use of integrated testing.\n- Beginning in FY 2021, Cybersecurity efforts in this project will be moved to project 048.\n- Beginning in FY 2021, USD(R&E) consolidated all policy and workforce efforts under the SE Program Element 0605142D8Z.  T&E Policy and Workforce efforts will be managed and funded from that PE with support from this PE."

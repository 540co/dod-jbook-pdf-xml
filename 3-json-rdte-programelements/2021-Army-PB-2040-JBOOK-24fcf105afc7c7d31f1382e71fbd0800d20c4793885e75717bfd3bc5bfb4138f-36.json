            "val": "Project 253, Dscs-Dcs (Phase II), SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 - Unified Network.  Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nFY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $4.376 million develops Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated Mission Command Network and Systems requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, military departments, Department of State and other government departments and agencies.\n\nProject 456, MILSATCOM System Engineering supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network.  Efforts are aligned to support the Network Cross-Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\n456 - MILSATCOM System Engineering assures the tactical Army satellite communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-the-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide.  MILSATCOM System Engineering shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes.  MILSATCOM System Engineering represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial and International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces.  These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.\n\nProject 456 also includes Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM efforts, which fill a critical communications gap for anti-jam SATCOM capability for mobile ground forces conducting expeditionary operations in electronically contested environments.  It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement.  It will offer the tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional.  These efforts are synchronized with the Air Force and DoD's plans for Protected Tactical Waveforms (PTW) on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), the Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS), and commercial SATCOM systems.\n\nProtected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM is a continuation of efforts previously funded under the MILSATCOM System Engineering (1203142A\/FE2) and Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (1203142A\/FI8) lines.  MILSATCOM System Engineering supported development and testing of prototype PTW modems during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) in FY 2019.  Protected Tactical Anti-jam SATCOM supported initial development, testing and certification of production representative PTW modems, incorporating Army specific requirements, to support continued spiral development of critical protected communications capabilities to address resiliency in jamming environments in FY 2020.\n\nFY 2021 funding supports the systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with Joint SATCOM development efforts.  This line continues to fund the systems architecture and analysis for current and future SATCOM efforts in both wideband and protected satellite communications.  This effort includes collaborative work with the Air Force on the prototype Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem development and testing during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD).  It also funds system engineering efforts the Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) program which will test the PTW modem over Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) as well as Protected Tactical SATCOM (PTS), which is the next generation satellite constellation.  Funding includes the Network Centric Waveform Tool (NCWT) development and testing and other efforts that have impacts on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations.\n\nFY 2021 funding also supports continued collaborative development, testing and certification with the Air Force of critical protected tactical capabilities.\n\nMILSATCOM System Engineering (0303142A\/456) funding is a realignment of funding from MILSACTOM System Engineering (1203142A\/FE2) and Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (1203142A\/FI8)."

Efforts are aligned to support the Network Cross-Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nMILSATCOM System Engineering assures the tactical Army satellite communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-the-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide.  MILSATCOM System Engineering shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes.  MILSATCOM System Engineering represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial and International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces.  These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.\n\nMILSATCOM System Engineering includes Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM efforts, which fill a critical communications gap for anti-jam SATCOM capability for mobile ground forces conducting expeditionary operations in electronically contested environments.  It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement.  It will offer the tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional.  These efforts are synchronized with the Air Force and DoD's plans for Protected Tactical Waveforms (PTW) on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), the Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS), and commercial SATCOM systems.\nProtected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM is a continuation of efforts previously funded under the MILSATCOM System Engineering (1203142A\/FE2) and Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (1203142A\/FI8) lines.  MILSATCOM System Engineering supported development and testing of prototype PTW modems during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) in FY 2019.  Protected Tactical Anti-jam SATCOM supported initial development, testing and certification of production representative PTW modems, incorporating Army specific requirements, to support continued spiral development of critical protected communications capabilities to address resiliency in jamming environments in FY 2020.\n\nFY 2021 funding supports the systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with Joint SATCOM development efforts.  This line continues to fund the systems architecture and analysis for current and future SATCOM efforts in both wideband and protected satellite communications.  This effort includes collaborative work with the Air Force on the prototype Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem development and testing during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD).  It also funds the system engineering efforts associated with the Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) program, which will develop, test, and enable PTW communications over Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) as well as Protected Tactical SATCOM (PTS), which is the next generation satellite constellation.\n\nFY 2021 funding also supports continued collaborative development, testing and certification with the Air Force of critical protected tactical capabilities."

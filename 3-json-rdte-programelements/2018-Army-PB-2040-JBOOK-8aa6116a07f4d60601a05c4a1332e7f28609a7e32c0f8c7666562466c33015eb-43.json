            "val": "Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration. The core functions of DCGS-A are: the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities. DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE). DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. As new software capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of modifications will be integrated and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.\n\nDCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) for FY19 fielding.\n\nDCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission. DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment. The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle. This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.\n\nThe DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based data center processing environments. The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment\/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored. This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems. Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12\/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, Follow-on Test & Evaluation in 3QFY15, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Baseline throughout the Army.\n\nFY2018 has no funding for Project 956.\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $24.700 million for D07, DCGS-A, will continue the iterative software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires. DCGS-A will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi- intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities. This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE), while providing the incremental software updates required to remain current."

That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCG\/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. \n\nDCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance\/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. \n\nPM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software and hardware integration for Increment 1, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts."

The DCGS-A program will consist of multiple software releases structured to meet DCGS-A User requirements.  The DCGS-A program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively provide and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment\/hardware, providing low risk, efficient, time- phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army\u2019s operational needs.\n\nThe DCGS-A capabilities under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the future DCGS-A requirements set. The DCGS-A will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.\n\nDCGS-A is a collection of software packages (COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data. DCGS-A delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon\u2019s intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A will deliver these capabilities by fielding software releases with incremental increases in capabilities with each release. DCGS-A is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons.  DCGS-A provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.\n\nThe DCGS-A software baseline will be updated and iteratively deployed to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements. PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, will align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk integration and test cycle times. The time phasing of planned content of each release will be based upon an assessment of available and projected technological solution sets. The DCGS-A software will be hardware agnostic so that the software can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment. This allows the DCGS-A software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons. The implementation of the latest COTS hardware procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, will result in significant cost efficiencies."

            "val": "The Defense Technical Information Center\u2019s (DTIC) unique mission is to aggregate and fuse science and technology data to provide rapid, accurate, and reliable knowledge to researchers and developers of the next generation of technologies needed to assure our national security.  DTIC, a DoD Field Activity under the authority, direction and control of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)), is the DoD\u2019s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and industry-related information.  DTIC provides USD(R&E) the capability to develop and deliver new information products and tools to share knowledge and enhance decision making.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) provides for DTIC mission operations, which are focused on three core efforts:  Collection, Dissemination, and Information Analysis Centers (IACs): \n1)  Collect, curate, and preserve science and technical information resulting from DoD\u2019s $14B annual investment.  Build upon past work to avoid costly and time-delaying rework. \n2)  Share and disseminate information as required by statute; provide access to more than 4.4 Million technical records.  Provide DoD users improved situational awareness.  Simplify and reduce expertise needed to discover the most relevant of information - provide role based content, research results, budget investment, where work is being done, by who, and what level of maturity.  \n3)  Operate the DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs), centered on Defense Systems; Cyber Security and Information Systems; and Homeland Defense and Security.  The IACs provide the Department with an R&D contracting vehicle to support PEO and PM insertion of technical innovation into systems of record.\n\nOther priority DTIC mission activities are described below:\n1)  Foster collaboration across communities, researchers, warfighters, industry, academia, Federal agencies, and Allies.  Increase collaboration between S&T\/RDT&E and warfighters.\n2)  Ensure information protection, document marking, authenticate and validate users, enforce access controls.\n3)  Develop and manage DoD\u2019s Science Technology Information Policy (STIP).\n4)  Agile software development, secure (cyber), and host applications supporting R&E initiatives and activities.\n5)  Maintain compliance with existing public law, regulations, and guidelines.\n6)  Implement congressionally-mandated programs, as directed within the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA):\n- Innovators Information Repository (IIR):  increase awareness of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\/ Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) and other small business innovative technology capability and improve transition to systems of record.  DTIC is creating a database with reports, proposals, and vendor information.\n- Global Research Watch (GRW) Program:  provide decision quality analysis of open source information.  The Strategic Intelligence & Analysis Cell (SIAC) program is evaluating potential algorithms that will analyze journal literature and other open source information from both allies and competitors.  DTIC will manage and host in the cloud a tool based on promising algorithms.\n- Datasets and Data Repositories:  establish database of datasets created during research activities to support reuse; encourage data management planning with each research project.  DTIC is creating a dataset directory to direct users to organizations holding relevant datasets.\n\nIn support of these mission operations, DTIC purchases space and critical shared services (e.g., human resources (HR); financial management; contracting; common-use IT services and security; communications; and civilian payroll services) from expert and efficient DoD service-providers.\n\nDTIC MISSION RESULTS\n\nThe Department invests over $90 Billion annually in Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) needed to protect and defend our nation.  DTIC preserves the fruits of these costly labors for reuse across the enterprise.  As an efficient and cost-effective steward of technical information, DTIC collects data and provides answers to researchers seeking state-of-the-art data relevant to their projects.  Through this interchange of information, DTIC accelerates innovation and prevents duplication of experiments, tests, and prototyping activities because researchers can build on what has been done or choose other paths if prior research resulted in a dead end. Using DTIC-created forums, researchers, Warfighters, and industry partners can also rapidly collaborate and connect across the DoD research and engineering (R&E) enterprise.  Finally, DTIC provides a department-level map of R&D activity.  This map gives decision-makers insight into current and past research, highlighting where progress is being made and by whom.  Through the preservation and sharing of the results of billions of dollars of past DoD investments, DTIC increases the return on past investments and accelerates current efforts, saving the Department precious time and dollars.  Through its collaboration tools and outreach to the R&E community, DTIC connects researchers across the lab enterprise, to include researchers and engineers, Warfighters and DoD\u2019s industry partners.\n\nDTIC's Information Analysis Centers (IACs) drive innovation and technological development by anticipating and responding to the information needs of the defense and broader community.  The IAC Program Management Office (IAC PMO) provides core funding, management and oversight of three IACs, which are chartered by DoD to collect, research, analyze, and disseminate scientific and technical information in specialized fields to DoD researchers and acquisition professionals.  In addition, the IAC PMO manages several multiple award contracts to make possible new research that builds on prior investments and incorporates the innovations of government, industry, and academia.  For the last several years, competition inherent in the IAC model has produced savings of 10-16% under projected costs, while still delivering vetted technical expertise to address DoD\u2019s complex challenges.  Providing DoD labs and program managers access to thousands of industry subject matter experts, the IACs performed $2 Billion of customer-funded research and analysis in FY 2019.  The results of the work are a rich source of new material in DTIC's technical repositories and are available to users across the Department.  The IAC approach was identified as a \"best practice\" by the Director of Defense Pricing and Contracting and the then-Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in a July 2018 memo wherein they recommended use of the IAC contracts across DoD as \"vehicles of first choice.\"\n\nNATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY\n\nThe DTIC and IAC mission operations described above are focused on actively supporting USD(R&E) efforts in generating decisive and sustained U.S. military advantages through the pursuit of three distinct lines of effort, as outlined in the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS):  \n\n1)  Rebuild military readiness as we build a more lethal Joint Force:  Develop and implement machine learning and semantic language algorithms to simplify discovery of relevant information \u2013 reduce search time and user expertise, provide tailored and actionable results, provide ability for S&T communities to collaborate with stakeholders and partners.\n2)  Strengthen alliances as we attract new partners:  Modernize user validation technology, implement White House directed Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) markings while continuing to support legacy distribution code marking, support White House Open Science mandate and provide information to allies while preventing release of sensitive documents and data. \n3)  Reform the Department\u2019s business practices for greater performance and affordability:  Increase ability and reduce time and cost to respond to current and future R&E support needs.  Migrate application hosting to the cloud; develop modular components; leverage Open Source, commercial, and Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) technology; leverage the Information Analysis Center contracting model."

DTIC provides public access to DoD-funded journal articles and research data, and increases outreach to industry through DTIC\u2019s Defense Innovation Marketplace.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nDTIC provides interactive tools and advanced tailored search engines to leadership, scientists and engineers, PMs and PEOs, warfighters and budget analysts.  Furthermore, DTIC protects and preserves DoD\u2019s multi-billion dollar investment in research, which empowers the acquisition enterprise through innovative tools, information systems, and decision support capabilities. The efficiency benefits can be enormous.  Each 1 percent increase in the reuse of S&T efforts produces over $100 Million in savings that can be redirected.  Those savings come from elimination of inefficient redundancy (and unnecessary delays), increased community interaction, and ultimately, a more capable military.  DTIC is uniquely positioned to support and to ensure the value of DoD\u2019s R&D portfolio is fully realized."

IACs serve as a bridge between the warfighter and the Acquisition\/Research community, providing essential technical analysis and data support to a diverse customer base, to include the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, and the Military Services.  IACs actively partner and collaborate with Defense Research and Engineering (R&E) focus groups and communities of interest in areas of specialized fields or specific technologies.  The IACs create and maintain comprehensive knowledge analysis centers that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. They are staffed with scientists, engineers and information specialists to provide research and analysis to customers with diverse, complex and challenging requirements.  IAC operations, in concert with 2018 National Defense Strategy objectives, directly support the warfighter, and play an ongoing and critical role in solving key CCMD operational issues such as cyber security, unmanned aerial vehicle visual\/audible signature reduction, and improvements to the ballistic resistance of body armor.\n\nThe IAC Program Management Office at DTIC performs contract acquisition, program management, and operational support for IAC contract operations and the technical information that is generated as a result of research and studies. In a time of shrinking budgets and increasing responsibility, IACs are a valuable resource for accessing scientific and technical information culled from efforts to solve new and historic challenges.  Direct IAC customer support activities, such as Task Order processing, Basic Center of Operations (BCO) support, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) activities, contracting\/acquisition related activities, etc., are funded in part through partnerships with the Defense R&E community and the annual collection of customer reimbursements for their share of direct costs, in accordance with the IAC Reimbursable Review Board (IRRB) recommendations.  This represents the maximum cost-sharing with IAC customers allowable, per guidance from the OSD Office of General Counsel. Annual IAC efforts and accomplishments are dependent on the level of participation and collaboration by the R&E community at large."

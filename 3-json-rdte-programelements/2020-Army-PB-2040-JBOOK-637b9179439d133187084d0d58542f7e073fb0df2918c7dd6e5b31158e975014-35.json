The GCSS-Army program, coupled with AESIP, are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. The GCSS-Army approved Capability Development Document and Capability Production Document require an enterprise approach to replace current logistics and maintenance Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS).  GCSS-Army provides the Army's sustainment support for the soldier with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible, and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge. The AESIP program provides the system's enterprise hub services, centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence\/analytics.  GCSS-Army implements best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of The Army Campaign Plan. GCSS-Army Increment 1 is now in the Capability Support phase, but requires continuous enhancements and will have a large increase in FY 2021 for particular enhancements for ground disconnected operations (wartime requirement) and enhanced audit initiatives.. \n\nBuilding on the foundation of the GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence\/Business Warehouse (BI\/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers.  Upon the completion of Increment 2, the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A(E)), Unmanned Aircraft System-Initiative (UAS-I), and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by capabilties implemented in GCSS-ARMY, AESIP, and the Logistics Modernization Program.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding provides for the blueprinting, design, engineering, integration, and testing of the GCSS-Army Enterprise Aviation software enhancement Release 2. It continues work on the change requests for the baseline system, build out the BI\/BW capability, enhance Army logistics common operating picture capability, and continue development of the APS capability in both GCSS-Army and the Logistics Modernization Program (LMP)."

GCSS-Army is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that tracks unit supplies, spare parts, organizational equipment, maintenance, total cost of ownership, and other financial transactions related to logistics for all Army units.  This modernized application subsumes the outdated STAMIS that is not financially compliant and will integrate numerous local supply and logistics databases into a single, enterprise-wide authoritative system.  GCSS-Army is financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise Strategy to be financially auditable.  GCSS-Army affects every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, Logistics Readiness Center, and property book office in the Army. GCSS-Army is a key component of an ERP integrated solution that optimizes tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single approach.  Delivering GCSS-Army eliminates the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems that are not cyber compliant, resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system."

GCSS-Army, coupled with AESIP, are information and communications technology investments that currently provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. \n\nBuilding on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced BI\/BW and APS functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers.  Upon the completion of Increment 2, the ULLS-A(E), UAS-I, and AWRDS will be retired since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by capabilities implemented in GCSS-ARMY, AESIP Hub, and the Logistics Modernization Program.\nEnterprise Aviation capabilities extends timely and accurate visibility and accountability of materiel across the Army Logistics enterprise to Aviation Logistics, will provide capability support to Army aviation airworthiness, and allow auditability of transactions to unit level.  Implementation of the BI\/BW capabilities provide enhancements in materiel and supply chain readiness analytics that are critical to inform commanders' understanding of weapons systems readiness, helping them make better decisions faster on the battlefield and helping the Army achieve auditability.  The APS capabilities directly impacts the speed at which a deploying unit can draw combat equipment while reducing the burden of the day-to-day maintenance and accountability of APS stock in the LMP.  Increment 2 will have Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) requirements until FY 2022.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding for GCSS-Army Increment 2 provides RDT&E efforts for Enterprise Aviation Release 2 to complete software development, Limited User Testing, Developmental Test and Evaluation, and begin Operational Test and Evaluation in FY 2020.  Release 3 will begin software development to include system design effort, design reviews and provide Development Test and Evaluation.  The BI\/BW will be funded for incremental development to enhance AESIP Hub data foundation, enhance the Army Readiness Common Operating Picture and perform predictive analytics. \nThe FY 2020 funding will also provide funds to continue Wave 3 APS design and development in GCSS-Army, AESIP and LMP, and to expand the streamlined LMP business processes associated with the planning and management of war reserve stock and integrate those processes across the ERPs."

            "val": "The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) addresses the supercomputing requirements of Department of Defense (DoD) scientists and engineers by: (1) demonstrating and maturing the most advanced, leading-edge computational architectures while exploiting the resulting systems by employing complementary specialized expertise; (2) demonstrating and maturing the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), which investigates, demonstrates, and matures leading-edge digital networking and security technologies to securely deliver computational capabilities to the distributed DoD Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) community; and (3) leveraging specialized expertise from DoD, other federal departments and agencies, industry, and academia to demonstrate and mature leading-edge software application codes. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive computational capabilities to demonstrate and mature emerging technologies that address the supercomputing requirements of the DoD RDTE community in the areas of hardware, software, and programming environments. All HPCMP sites are interconnected to each other, the DoD High Performance Computing (HPC) RDTE community, and other major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which investigates, demonstrates, and matures (a) state-of-the-art digital networking technologies to ensure a robust distributed environment and (b) the most advanced digital security capabilities to protect the intellectual property of the DoD and its contract entities as they employ HPCMP capabilities. The HPCMP's software application effort (a) optimizes, enhances, demonstrates, and matures critical DoD physics-based and engineering software to allow scientists and engineers to execute calculations with precision and efficiency on leading-edge supercomputers, (b) demonstrates and matures immersive collaborative programming environments to improve science and engineering workflows, and (c) demonstrates and matures leading-edge computational technology from academia and industry. These synergistic activities collectively demonstrate and mature horizontal technologies that are exploited across the DoD RDTE community, ensuring the DoD maintains the most advanced research and development ecosystem in computationally-intensive modeling and design.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The computational expertise and resources enable Department of Defense (DoD) personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state-of-the-art computer network technologies. The Software Application effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

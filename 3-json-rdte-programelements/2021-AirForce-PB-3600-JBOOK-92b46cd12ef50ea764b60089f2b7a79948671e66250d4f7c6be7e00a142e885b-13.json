            "val": "This program develops enterprise-centric information technology for the Air Force. Advances in enterprise-centric information technologies are required to increase warfighter readiness and effectiveness by providing the right information, at the right time, in the right format, anytime, anywhere in the world. The Connectivity and Protection Tech project provides the technologies for multi-level, secure, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept techniques, as well as technologies that deter any adversary from attacking computer systems while allowing access to, presence on, manipulation of, and operational effects on adversary computer systems. This project also develops the technology base for the next generation of ultra-wide-bandwidth, multi-channeled, air- and space-based communications networks. The Information Management and Computational Tech project provides advances in information management and dissemination technologies to ensure the delivery of high-quality, timely, secure information to the warfighter, and develop technologies to produce both advanced on demand computational processing and computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Air Force systems. The Information Decision Making Tech project develops the technology to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations. The Operational Awareness Tech project develops technologies that improve their capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information. The Research Site Support project provides the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, New York and provides for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625316, Info Mgt and Computational Tech, Project 625317, Information Decision Making Tech, and Project 625318, Operational Awareness Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0622041F, 0602605F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

The technologies developed under this project enable the National Defense Strategy and Air Force future operating concepts which require operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate\u2014and shift among\u2014multiple solutions for a given challenge), creating combinations of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities to achieve desired effects in the battlespace.\n\nThis project provides the technologies for secure, self-configuring, self-healing, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept communications techniques; agile and dynamic policy-based network management capabilities; and modular, programmable, low-cost software radios. In addition, it develops both the technology base for ultra-wide bandwidth and multi-channeled communications networks (both air and space based) on and between platforms.\n\nThis project provides the technologies which enable the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.\n\nThis project advances technologies enabling the effective execution of military objectives that will vastly improve the ability to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations (air, space, and cyberspace) at all levels of war (strategic, operational, and tactical) and during all phases of conflict. This project provides technologies for anticipatory decision support; course of action development, planning, scheduling, and assessment; and the real-time effective portrayal of complex data sets.\n\nThis project improves and automates the capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information.  This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625316, Info Mgt and Computational Tech, Project 625317, Information Decision Making Tech, and Project 625318, Operational Awareness Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

Advances in robust information management focus on quality of service and flow of information within the enterprise, information transformation and brokering, secure information sharing across and among domains, and collaboration of workflow within the enterprise.  Technologies addressed in this project include the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of  information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of information and information assets in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625316, Info Mgt and Computational Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

Technology development in this project includes anticipatory decision support; course of action development, planning, scheduling, and assessment; and the real-time effective portrayal of complex data sets.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of information and information assets in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625317, Information Decision Making Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.  It leads the research, discovery, and development of technology that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence sources to provide accurate object tracking and identification, situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace (air, ground, space, and cyber).  It also leads in the development of advanced exploitation technologies to maximize the intelligence gained from our adversaries in the areas of spectral detection and geolocation, signal recognition and analysis, and the data tagging, tracking, and tracing via the insertion of secure, imperceptible signal embedding for future fusion and understanding of the information.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, the Air Force requires dynamic and elastic intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance forces and capabilities to provide actionable intelligence to commanders and to increase understanding of the environment and an adversary's capabilities and intentions.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625318, Operational Awareness Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

The focus of the work is to provide the warfighter with the required technology-based capabilities to defend the Nation by unleashing the power of innovative information science and technology to anticipate, find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess anything, anytime, anywhere. Since the site is a single-purpose location which is not located on a military installation, the Information Directorate has unique requirements for supporting its science and technology mission.  As the host unit, the directorate is responsible to provide the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, New York and provide for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission.  Operations include: logistics and communication services, utilities, maintenance of facilities and structures, safety and security of the workforce and visiting researchers, and ensures compliance with the laws, regulations, and directives that pertain to site operations.  These services are host unit responsibilities and are necessary to provide a safe and effective environment for the Research Site's workforce and mission."

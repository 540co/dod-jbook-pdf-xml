RCA provides rapid fielding of capabilities in three areas: defend the Air Force portion of the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) in response to emerging threats; network attack and cyber exploitation capabilities through all phases of warfare; and new cyber operational capabilities that address cyber gaps in evolving mission areas.\n\nRCA delivers operational cyber capabilities to 24th Air Force (24 AF) warfighters in mission-relevant timeframes. RCA provides capabilities in support of US national security interests, to counter current and future cyber threats, and to enhance the nation's ability to operate in cyberspace. It expedites cyber development and modifications of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities. RCA provides solution sets for cyberspace operations: attack, defense, command and control\/situational awareness, exploitation, critical infrastructure support, combat support and cybersecurity products and services. RCA provides integration, and technical support to other Service and Government Agency activities to leverage select Air Force-developed technologies and\/or operational capabilities. RCA will develop materiel or non-materiel cyber solutions, conduct rapid prototyping, integration and transition activities for cyber systems. Activities include, but are not limited to: development of software\/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab-developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction for emerging technologies. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This approach allows flexibility for solutions to enter into the acquisitions process at any phase of the acquisitions life cycle management system.  These plans meet the written acquisition planning requirements and guidance. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Rapid Cyber Acquisition considers existing contracting vehicles, including but not limited to: Network Centric Solutions (NETCENTS), NETCENTS 2, Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-2 (ITES-2), Government-Wide Acquisition Contract vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules, HNCY Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, National Security Agency vehicles and Cyber Warfare Systems Branch Class Justification and Approval document. Multiple award contractual vehicles, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration's SEWP IV, provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Rapid Cyber Acquisition. These multiple-award vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act and only require that Rapid Cyber Acquisition provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies."

            "val": "The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based, Combined Arms Training Strategy. The CATT program portfolio directly supports the Army's Training Strategy and progressive training model by providing realistic training events and comprehensive After Action Reviews (AAR). CATT enables units, from crew to the battalion task force level, to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic, interactive, synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and AAR for CATT expansions, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) supports combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, ground-air coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication, command, control, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT, units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises, as well as training tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment. Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions, CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces, CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training, and realistic simulation training in CATT, is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in combat operations.\n\nFY 2021 base funding of $3.568 million for SE Core will continue the development of the Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC) to ensure that the process remains Army Geospatial Center (AGC) certified, in addition to, ensuring that the terrain data remains concurrent with supported training systems in fulfilling its synthetic terrain requirements."

Additionally, program acquires technical support to provide system monitoring of the GFT hardware and software configuration to ensure compliance with Army's RMF requirements.\n\nIn FY 2018, the GFT Program was directed to complete divestment by the end of FY 2023, due to the requirement for training at the company echelon and below using gaming technologies being provided by the Synthetic Training Environment (STE) starting in FY 2021.  In order to meet this desired end state, the program conducted the following contractual efforts in FY 2019: (1) Awarded a hardware procurement contract in 2nd quarter of FY 2019 through the ARMY Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solution (CHESS) program for the planned GFT Classroom Suites and Technical Refreshes scheduled in FY 2019 and FY 2020. (2) Awarded an IT Services Contract in 2nd quarter of FY 2019 to provide network technical support, and to facilitate the program's cybersecurity strategy for its fielded systems through FY 2023. (3) Issued a Task Order award in 3rd quarter of FY 2019 to acquire fielding and logistics support for planned GFT Classroom Fieldings slated in FY 2019 and FY 2020.  The aforementioned contractual efforts will support the program achieving Full Operational Capability (FOC) in FY 2020 (all 115 BOIP Cyber Compliant Classroom Suites will be installed). After FOC, the program will commence sustainment of all fielded GFT Systems through FY 2022, followed by a Divestment Period beginning in FY 2023 and completing by the end of the fiscal year."

The SE Core Program is a foundational element and the only provider of correlated terrain for the Army's Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE) that links Army training systems and simulators into an integrated and interoperable environment.  SE Core's mission is to ensure that Army systems and simulators support U.S. Army Readiness by providing visual models (buildings and vehicles), terrain (over which the simulator moves), and entity behaviors (models performing realistic and appropriate actions such as movement and weapon effects) that are relevant and realistic in support of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) 2028. As the exclusive provider of correlated terrain, SE Core ensures that all Army simulators\/operators receive terrain that allows for a \"Fair Fight\" capability; that is, no one will have an inherent advantage over another because training did not occur on a \"level playing field\".  Fair Fight allows air and ground forces to hold coordinated and integrated training events that accurately replicate combat operations for a train-as-we-fight capability.  \n\nA major component of the program is the SE Core-developed Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC), the process used to build the terrain and models that the simulators and simulations employ. The Army Geospatial Center (AGC) gave SE Core its highest rating, the \"Gold Standard\", based on the quality of the STDGC process and the geospatial data generated by it.  The program has been a certified, AGC co-producer of geospatial data since 2014.  In addition to the correlated terrain databases and common visual models, SE Core components include Virtual One Semi-Automated Forces (Virtual OneSAF) (the computer generated force behaviors for virtual systems); the virtual systems architecture; and mission command development. \n\nFY 2021 base funding of $3.568 million for SE Core will continue the development of the STDGC to ensure that the process remains AGC certified, in addition to, ensuring that the terrain data remains concurrent with supported training systems in fulfilling its synthetic terrain requirements."

The most recently awarded RDTE effort was on the fourth delivery order, awarded in September 2014, which included options for gunnery enhancements, integrated data modem development, training environment virtualization, aviation mission planning software development, maintenance tool kit development, manned unmanned teaming, and AH-64E concurrency development.\n\nThe government awarded a single award, CPFF, IDIQ services contract to Cole Engineering Services, Inc, a small business, in September 2015.  The period of performance of the base contract is through September 2020.   The third task order, awarded in June 2016, included hardware modernization development and Windows 10 research and testing.  \n\nAVCATT utilizes small business competitively awarded contract vehicles when able. Currently small businesses are conducting development for dynamic terrain enhancements, NCM3 development, and training effectiveness analysis.\n\nThe AVCATT program is post Milestone C. Although the system is in the production phase, continuous research, development, testing, and engineering is required in order to maintain concurrency with the real world aircraft and systems that the AVCATT simulates in the virtual training environment. The AVCATT program has fielded the full base order of issue of 23 suites but continues to release incremental hardware and software upgrades at approximate semiannual intervals.  RDTE efforts will not continue in FY 2020, as system begins its transition into sustainment."

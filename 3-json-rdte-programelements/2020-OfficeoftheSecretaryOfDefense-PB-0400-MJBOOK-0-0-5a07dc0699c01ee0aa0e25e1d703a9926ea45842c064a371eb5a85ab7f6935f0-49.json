Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\n\nThis program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment & Program Evaluation (CAPE) by funding activities that help CAPE to implement the Department's intent to reinvigorate wargaming.  CAPE accomplishes this by leading wargaming activities, developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames. This was a new start program in FY 2017. \nThis program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  \n\nThese RDT&E resources support critical studies and analyses to assist senior DoD leaders in optimally balancing the lethality, partnership, and reform levels of effort to carry out the National Defense Strategy.  \nThe research agenda focuses on near- to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants."

Program components include: Eagle Vision, DoD's only world-wide deployable commercial imagery ground station capability, and ISR Innovations, rapid prototyping, operational evaluation and fielding of short-notice, high-payoff capabilities addressing immediate gaps and\/or shortfalls identified by Warfighting activities.\n\nFY18 funds support NOWcasting, Atmospheric Sensing and Prediction System (ASAPS), and Caldera Event.\n\n1. NOWcasting:  NOWcasting is an automated system that provides intuitive, animated, machine-to-machine weather forecasts directly to warfighter computer applications every 15 minutes.  NOWcasting expands on current weather models by incorporating non-traditional sources of weather information (the most significant being Space Based Infrared System [SBIRS] data) that significantly increases forecast resolution and accuracy.  Its exploitation of SBIRS PoR data sources helps maximize the effectiveness of existing OPIR architecture and data sources. \n \n2. ASAPS:  Atmospheric Sensing and Prediction System (ASAPS) is a platform-integrated sensor for detecting adverse weather conditions such as clouds and icing.  Sensing of other adverse weather phenomena, specifically lightning, would further protect valuable airborne assets and support mission success.  While initially envisioned to improve environmental awareness for Remotely Piloted Aircraft--which are particularly susceptible to lightning damage due to their composite structure--the technology could expand to contribute to the distributed, collaborative, and self-organizing sensor systems providing environmental threat detection for autonomous swarming aircraft.\n\n3. Caldera Event:  Caldera Event is a non-GPS system that provides Position, Navigation, Timing (PNT), and Geolocation Capabilities in an fully GPS-denied or jammed environment.  The prototype system provides insight and experimentation for the future of combined PNT, Electronic Warfare, and communications systems.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

            "val": "The QRSP Program Element develops risk-reducing prototypes and conducts demonstrations designed to develop capabilities in anticipation of emerging adversary threats, while addressing immediate Combatant Commands (CCMD) needs.  QRSP efforts support the Department\u2019s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by acting as an incubator for developing potentially game-changing capabilities and by fostering collaboration among other government agencies, DoD laboratories, academia, and the commercial sector.  DoD\u2019s strategy recognizes a return to a more competitive environment with resurgence of near-peer competitors and adversaries who have studied and worked to counter U.S. technological capabilities.  QRSP provides an agile mechanism to affordably counter emerging technological threats and help maintain the United States\u2019 competitive advantage.  Specifically, QRSP enables the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) to anticipate and respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the building blocks for the Third Offset Strategy, Reliance 21, the Long Range Research and Development Program Plan, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).  QRSP efforts field new capabilities at low cost and in short time-frames, inform the requirements process, and inject innovative technologies into programs of record.  The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell support.  Focus areas within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, including counter anti-access\/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; target identification and tracking; surveillance, intelligence, and reconnaissance; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; and, autonomous systems.\n\nThe QRF Program objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  QRF projects focus on force protection to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, broad electronic warfare capabilities, mitigating hardware and software vulnerabilities, and autonomous learning systems for processing and analyzing intelligence streams.  QRF initiates projects during the execution year and focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the CCMDs by producing prototypes for demonstration and evaluation.  QRF projects typically advance  Technology Readiness Level (TRL) four to five technologies to transition them to an end user or CCMD at a TRL of seven or higher with a total project duration of 12 months.  The QRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).\n \nThe RRF Program objectives, executed by RRTO, are to develop proof-of-principle prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats, anticipate adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies, and expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop, demonstrate, assess, and rapidly field innovative concepts and technologies that supply critical capabilities to meet time-sensitive operational needs.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as advanced algorithms and software intelligence, to enable virtual prototyping with agile capability delivery and technology insertion.  RRTO leverages our traditional industrial bases and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses to address DoD needs as identified by CCMD, Military Service organizations, other Defense organizations, and interagency partners.  Typical RRF programs are 6 to 18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).       \n\nThe JRAC Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that have been submitted by CCMDs and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC\u2019s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the CCMD in a timeframe acceptable to the CCMD.  Efforts, in most instances, use contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.\n\nThe SMA Cell objective is to support all CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA Cell develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems that inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD's senior leadership."

The QSRP Program provides the flexibility and agility to mitigate emerging threats and address needs that arise faster than the two-year budget cycle. \n\nThe Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) Program provides the Services, components, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), and force providers opportunities to capitalize on relatively mature technologies to rapidly develop and field-test promising new proof-of-principle prototypes that can have immediate impact on time-sensitive operational needs.  QRF initiatives typically deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.\n\nThe QRF Program focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, and asymmetric warfare needs through rapidly developed and fielded hardware.  More specifically, the QRF Program includes initiatives that serve to maintain a technical advantage over potential adversaries and reduce technical risk barriers in the following interest areas: counter anti-access and area denial capabilities; base protection; electromagnetic bandwidth and spectrum enhancement; persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; newly emerging national threats; human-machine collaborative decision making; and, counter-electronic warfare technologies.  \n\nIn FY 2017 and FY 2018, the QRF Program will continue to identify and fund new, rapidly developed prototypes and technology demonstrations that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  Investments are made in the execution year for agile response to Department, CCMD, Service, and other government organization identified threats and opportunities.\n\nRecent success stories and significant transitions of note include:\n\u2022 Columbia:  This project is an electronic countermeasure system designed to address a specific threat to U.S. forces.  Details are classified.  The Columbia effort delivered a size, weight, and power (SWaP) assessment and laboratory electromagnetic interference\/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI\/EMC) analysis of a sustainable, maintainable, self-contained capability that will mitigate the effects of an attack by an overwhelming number of threats - individually or simultaneously.  Columbia transitioned to the Air Force in 2016. \n\u2022 Dark Storm:  This project successfully developed and fielded low-cost, innovative space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities.  Data collected from six remote sites was transferred and consolidated at a central site to provide increased SSA.  The full capability transitioned to a classified customer.\n\u2022 Deer Hunting:  As a follow-on to the initial prototype, this project automated a proven target discovery process that was demonstrated for the National Security Agency (NSA).  The automation allowed Deer Hunting to scale and transition to other projects using a target agnostic approach.  The classified capability transitioned to U.S. Central Command and other missions within the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community.  \n\u2022 Interruption of Wide-Area Sensing Capability (IWAS):  Persistent, wide-area surveillance capabilities threaten U.S. Navy open-ocean supremacy.  The IWAS project developed an electronic attack technique effective against wide-area surveillance sensors to disrupt their kill-chain.  The project successfully demonstrated the electronic attack capability before transitioning it to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to support development of specific applications.  Further details are classified."

The focus of this effort is to support counter Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) missions.  Transition partner applications integrate RATS technology with digital receiver platforms to automatically alert an analyst to new channels of interest, determine if a channel should be transmitted to the ground, scan other frequencies for desired signals, and control a digital receiver to dwell on the given channel.  This project is a collaboration with Naval Air Systems Command Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office (PMA-290), focusing on near-term deployment and follow-on integration on Navy signals intelligence platforms."

The QRSP Program provides the flexibility and agility to mitigate emerging threats and support current operations, including counter terrorism, by addressing needs that arise faster than the two-year budget cycle.  \n\nThe Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO was established to accelerate the development and transition of high-potential science and technology (S&T) projects through operationally useful virtual and proof-of-principle prototypes within the execution year of an identified need.  The RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T base and those of the other federal agencies, academia, and industry.  The office also stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation, expedites delivery of prototype capabilities and concepts to counter anticipated and emerging threats, and provides feedback to the S&T community to guide long term development strategies.  RRTO achieves this by anticipating adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responding to new threats and opportunities.  Projects support high level Department strategies and objectives, such as the building blocks for the Third Offset Strategy, the Defense Innovation Initiative, and geographic Combatant Command (CCMD) priorities.  Prototypes delivered and transitioned to operational users by RRTO demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and increase \u2018speed to market\u2019 by providing cost effective capabilities faster than typical acquisition cycles.\n\nIn prior years, RRTO, through RRF, explored novel methods and new approaches for persistent surveillance for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing emerging technologies.   \n\nIn FY 2017 and FY 2018, RRF will continue to provide a hedge against technology risk by identifying and developing near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.  RRF projects support goals from the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, & Logistics), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Emerging Capability & Prototyping).  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRF\u2019s current focus areas include: open source data analysis; autonomous systems and behaviors; urban characterization; prototypes for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; additive manufacturing to rapidly field prototypes; maritime technologies; and, wargaming for emerging threats and capabilities.   \n\nThe typical length of an RRTO project falls within a 6 to 18 month range to more effectively respond to Warfighter needs.\n\nRecent success stories and significant transitions of note include:\n\u2022 Next Generation Sequencing for Personnel Accounting Applications:  This project successfully developed, demonstrated, and made operational a new DNA analysis process and supporting analytic software to conduct mitochondrial DNA analysis on highly degraded samples.  This process allows familial matching on remains degraded by environmental conditions or contaminants that are recovered in support of the personnel accounting mission, or for the identification of high value individuals. \n\u2022 Biometric Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) Dissemination Management Server (BMDS):  This project successfully developed and demonstrated an automated BEWL dissemination prototype that improved the speed of delivering customized biometric watch lists by 38 times, while also significantly reducing errors.  The Army Program Manager for Biometrics will incorporate this tool into the Automated Biometric Identification System architecture.\n\u2022 Large Displacement Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (LDUUV) Common Control System (CCS):  LDUUV CCS successfully developed and demonstrated initial integration of the common control system software with a representative LDUUV to inform future acquisition activities.  This effort demonstrated command and control of LDUUVs from an unmanned air system workstation.  The technical data package and final report have been delivered to the Navy\u2019s Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) Program Office (PMS 406) to inform acquisition activities. \n\u2022 Flume:  The final phase of the Flume software project provided assured delivery of data over existing networks used by U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  The final phase of development consisted of tailoring the software to U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) missions.  The system demonstrated automated data transport, accelerated throughput, and high reliability through intermittent connections.  Flume has transitioned to AFSOC and other USSOCOM users.\n\u2022 Forward Firing Flare:  The Forward Firing Flare project delivered two ALE-47 chaff\/flare launchers in the forward firing configuration for nonstandard aircraft.  The products transitioned to assets deployed in support of U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM).\n\u2022 Intelligent Materials Sensor System (IMSS):  The IMSS prototype uses a unique phosphorescent nanomaterial to provide target identification information when illuminated.  Following a successful demonstration of this optically-transparent tagging mechanism USSOCOM and the U.S. Army contracted for procurement of the IMSS tags. \n\u2022 Laser Threat Detection and Defeat:  The project completed development of a phase one prototype system and demonstrated the ability to detect and locate indoor threats.  Subsequent demonstrations at Trident Spector 16 validated detection outdoors and the system transitioned to defense criminal investigative organizations."

This capability is critical to support the identification of remains lost from World War II and Korea as their direct relations may die before the service members\u2019 remains are located.  The final effort leverages FY 2016 funds to finish development and deliver an advanced file carving system.  This system will accelerate the extraction and categorization of files of interest from large data stores while simultaneously screening out useless junk files.  Depending on the file types, this carver will accelerate the process 25 percent to 80 percent over prior carving systems."

Due to increased speed from design to prototype, reduced cost, and reduced waste additive manufacturing provides a unique supporting capability for the Third Offset Strategy.  Additive manufacturing capabilities are rapidly developing in industry and other government agencies.  The Rapid Reaction Technology Office will leverage commercial innovation and emerging capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia to develop proof-of-principle prototypes focused on warfighter needs.  Projects include spare part replacement, jet engine repair, custom hardware enclosures, and three-dimensional (3-D) models.  Projects have the potential to significantly reduce the supply chain inefficiencies by storing parts as software and manufacturing on demand, and using rapid prototyping to reduce time and cost of design.  Projects can also reduce amount of labor required to produce functioning prototypes.  Deliverables will inform enhancement decisions and concept of operations development."

Specifically, if the U.S. Government is to respond effectively to the threats and opportunities presented in the increasingly gray security environment, it requires a more detailed map of the space between peace and war than it currently possesses.  The project provided a more rigorous and comprehensive articulation of the space between militarized conflict and peace.  The project team conducted a quantitative analysis of historical examples of gray conflicts and contemporary manifestations and geopolitical drivers.  The team assessed specific U.S. experience with \u2018Gray Zone\u2019 conflicts and what strategies and tactics have been most and least successful as instruments of U.S. policy.  The team also explored conceptual, procedural, and physical capabilities necessary for navigating this gray space.  The SMA team identified how the various elements of power need to be coordinated to effectively respond to \u2018Gray Zone\u2019 conflicts.  For example, by examining the interests, resources, and capabilities of violent extremist organizations and transnational criminal organizations in \u2018Gray Zone\u2019 regions.  The SMA team also investigated how violent non-state actors (VNSAs)\/violent extremist organizations (VEOs) and state actors create \u2018Gray Zones\u2019 differently.  The SMA team employed a variety of empirical approaches to this effort, involving simulation, geospatial, case-study, and statistical methodologies.  Products from the effort have been provided to USSOCOM, and all other CCMDs."

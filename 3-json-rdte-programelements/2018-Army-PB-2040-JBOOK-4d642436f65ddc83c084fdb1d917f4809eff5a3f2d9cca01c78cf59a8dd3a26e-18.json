This Project also investigates antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and to reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers, such as radios and jammers. Additionally, this Project investigates cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA), cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber attacks and new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. This Project also investigates software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and it design and develops spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of the congested RF spectrum. This Project also provides new capabilities to lower the size, weight, power and cost of networking systems deployed on Army platforms.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

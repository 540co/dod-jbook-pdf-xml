The gaps exist in several categories including threat density, type of threat and representation of specific threat systems and, if not mitigated, will prevent an effective OT for JSF.   The requested funding will procure 12 systems, in four categories, that increase the threat density, threat type and specific threat representation and upgrade an additional two systems to provide a higher fidelity representation of several threat types.   Additionally,  funding supports the initiation of site preparation and integration for radar signal emulators and the requirement to purchase additional materials for the open air radio frequency beam measurement capability.\n\nThe funding increase in the ENEWS program from FY17 to FY18 reflects the addition of one hardware simulator to the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems (ENEWS) hardware simulators to support the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 3. \n\nTechnical: Not applicable.\n\nSchedule: Not applicable."

The gaps exist in several categories including threat density, type of threat and representation of specific threat systems and, if not mitigated, will prevent an effective OT for JSF.   The requested funding will procure 12 systems, in four categories, that increase the threat density, threat type and specific threat representation and upgrade an additional two systems to provide a higher fidelity representation of several threat types.   Additionally,  funding supports the initiation of site preparation and integration for radar signal emulators and the requirement to purchase additional materials for the open air radio frequency beam measurement capability."

The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) Force, Special Operations, and other Electronic Warfare Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for Electronic Warfare system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield\/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems modeling tool that was developed to support Testing and Evaluation.  Simulation Display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) Testing and Evaluation and training ranges to provide visualization of Testing and Evaluation and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems Project is unique in that it is the only project within the Department of Defense dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard Electronic Warfare systems and tactics against these type threats.  The Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  Development Test, Operational Test and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation support includes AN\/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship InfraRed signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and Patrol Craft class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including Test and Evaluation of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' Electronic Warfare systems in joint allied exercises. Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets also support Joint Electronic Warfare exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations."

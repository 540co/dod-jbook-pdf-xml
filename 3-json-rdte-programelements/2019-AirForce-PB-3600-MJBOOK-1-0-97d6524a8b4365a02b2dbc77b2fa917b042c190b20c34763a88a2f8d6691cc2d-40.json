Its mission is being broadened to expedite developing and fielding operationally focused activities for immediate and near-term needs as directed by the Space RCO Executive Committee.  Key operating principles include a short and narrow chain of command, overarching programmatic insight, early and prominent war fighter involvement with small integrated operating teams within a single office.  U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) has identified three needs: 1) to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed to expand operational capability; 2) to rapidly reconstitute\/replenish critical space capabilities to preserve \"continuity of operations\" capability; 3) to rapidly exploit and infuse space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage.  Space RCO projects are optimized for prioritized theater use and\/or surge, augmentation and replenishment of traditional space capabilities.  The Space RCO Concept of Operations (CONOPS) drives the need for satellites featuring high degrees of modularity, standard interface vehicles, and the use of plug and play payloads and buses.\n\nThe Space RCO is ready to develop, test, train, and equip urgent needs of the warfighter as they are identified at any time.  First, the urgent needs must be validated by the commander, USSTRATCOM; second, the project must be approved by the Space RCO Executive Committee; third, the project will be executed by the Space RCO.  If the effort is initiated during execution year, it will be described in the next year's budget exhibit.\n\nThe highest priorities of the Space RCO are development and launch of the ORS-5 USSTRATCOM validated urgent need for space situational awareness; development and launch of the ORS-6 Compact Ocean Wind Vector Radiometer (COWVR) technology demonstration, and the low cost automated manufacturing initiative, ORS-7; and development and launch of the ORS-8 USSTRATCOM validated urgent need for an interim capability addressing weather gap 1 (cloud characterization) and gap 2 (theater weather imagery).  The remaining priorities are to satisfy the high priority needs for augmentation and reconstitution, including Missile Warning, Wideband Protected Communication, Narrowband Communication, Data Exfiltration, Space Situational Awareness, Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) imagery, Blue\/Friendly Force Situational Awareness, Maritime Domain Awareness, Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, Remote Access Solar Power, Weather, and Battlefield ISR.\n\nAdditional Space RCO efforts include maturing enabling elements which are transitioned as appropriate across the National Space Enterprise and allows the Space RCO to meet the USSTRATCOM specified responsiveness timelines and the 2007 NDAA goal ($40M satellites\/$20M launches).  This includes authenticating commercial space parts, confirming automated assembly lines, validating digital mission assurance processes, developing a modular open system architecture employing plug and play standards, and providing assembly, integration & test in the Rapid Response Space Works. It also includes integrating with the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) and Enterprise Ground Service (EGS) to proliferate common satellite command and control.  Additional developments include visionary, tailored, and future Space\/Cyber projects to special operations forces (SOF).\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\"\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver its capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

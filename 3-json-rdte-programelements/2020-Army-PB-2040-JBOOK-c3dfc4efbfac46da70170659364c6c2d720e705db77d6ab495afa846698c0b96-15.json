            "val": "Defensive Cyber Tool Development (DCTD) and Cyber Situational Understanding (SU) fall within Line of Effort (LOE) 1 of the Network Modernization Strategy framework, which incorporates cyber capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.\n\nOverall, Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and Cyber SU provide the tools and insight to proactively protect and defend the network at the tactical and strategic levels, thereby enabling the network to operate unfettered from the threat of cyberattacks.\n\nCY5 Cyber SU:\n\nCyber SU supports Cyber Electromagnetic Activity (CEMA) operations by providing visualization of CEMA information to improve planning, coordination, integration and synchronization of cyberspace operations and unified land operations. \n\nCyber SU provides the Brigade to Corps commanders the visualization of physical (geographically), logical (at a specific network internet protocol), and cyber persona layers (bad actors, from individuals to nation states) of cyberspace based on data\/information from multiple sources and sensors to produce a CEMA overlay on the commander's Common Operational Picture (COP) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE). Supporting CEMA, Cyber SU synchronizes and integrates red (enemy), grey (commercial\/private sector) and blue (friendly) cyberspace data, and enables collaboration at the tactical echelon. Further, in support of the Military Decision Making Process (planning and decision cycles), Cyber SU provides tactical commanders with a broad understanding of CEMA threats by informing the commander of any cyber related impacts to physical domains, unified land operations, and the overall mission. \n\nEV5 DCO:\n\nThe DCO group of programs develops, assesses, deploys, learns, and iterates essential cyberspace warfighting capabilities consisting of solutions based upon an infrastructure, platform, and tool\/payload approach. DCO capabilities are required in order to actively predict and conduct reconnaissance (search and discover) against advanced cyberspace threats (to include insider threats) and vulnerabilities that do not trigger or generate warnings using routine security measures. Additionally, DCO capabilities allow the Army to outmaneuver adversaries by performing preapproved, automated, agile, internal countermeasures that stop or mitigate cyberspace attacks. Moreover, DCO capabilities enable the Army to conduct cyberspace defense mission planning and protection that identifies and assures the availability of tasked critical assets and infrastructure supporting Army, DOD, host nation, and civil authority actions or missions. The overall objective is to achieve survivability of networks, IT platforms, and data through counter-mobility actions, dynamic movement of tasked critical assets, and security enhancement measures. This assures commanders from U.S. Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and other Army Service Component Commands Brigade through Corp down to the tactical level can execute national, joint, and\/or Army operational and tactical missions. These capabilities enable ARCYBER to support U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and defend all Army networks as part of its Service-retained responsibilities. DCO capabilities also enable Army National Guard and Reserve forces to support USC Title 10 missions under the auspices of ARCYBER or other major commands. \n\nDCO supports material solutions aligned to requirements outlined in the 26 October 2016 Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Defensive Cyberspace Operations Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD). DCO related infrastructure, platforms, and tools\/payloads enable the Army to maneuver, conduct reconnaissance, execute counter-mobility actions, and command and control DCO people, processes, and technologies within friendly cyberspace. DCO programs will allow near real-time employment of passive and active measures to preserve the ability to utilize friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems. These programs directly support USCYBERCOM Integrated Priority List #2 Produce Advanced Cyberspace Infrastructure and #5 Defensive Forces to execute passive and active defense operations at net-speed."

TCM Cyber is preparing Core Functionality and Understanding Cyberspace Requirement Definition Package (RDP) in support of Cyber SU. The RDP and subsequent Capability Drops (CDs) are to be approved by the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence in collaboration with U.S. Army Forces Command. Projected RDP approval is 29 January 2019 at the AROC Requirements Board. \n\nCyber SU will field increasing capability to meet the RDPs and CDs over the program's life cycle. Development of the capability will be depend on several factors, including (but not limited to) availability of commercial and\/or government-developed products and how easily the product(s) can be integrated. To that end, the program office intends to evaluate and leverage GOTS\/COTS products to the greatest extent and potentially leverage cyber solutions developed by related programs and science and technology efforts (e.g., Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) and Tactical DCO Infrastructure) to satisfy the requirements detailed in the Cyber SU RDPs\/CDs. The results of this analysis will inform the final decision on the acquisition strategy, which could include agile developer\/operator (DEVOPS) and Section 804. Coordination and integration with complimentary programs and systems-the sources of cyber data feeds-will be an integral part of the program to ensure the data is made available to be consumed by the Cyber SU solution.\n\nProgram Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), approved the Materiel Development Decision on 20 June 2018. The entry point into the acquisition life cycle and projected timeline to a milestone decision will be proposed to the MDA upon receipt and review of the validated RDPs."

The cyberspace analytics capability offers an integrated platform that can be leveraged across all security enclaves (NIPRNET, SIPRNET, and JWICS) to enhance both DCO and Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) operations (PEO EIS)\n-Mission Planning (MP): An application-based, scalable warfighting capability for Army DCO mission command and planning at the global, regional, and local levels. DCO MP enables integration, coordination, and synchronization of supported and supporting cyberspace defenders (PEO EIS)\n-Tools Suite: Flexible and dynamic suite of warfighting capabilities that enable Cyber Mission Forces and other cyberspace defenders to perform functional categories consisting of site survey; risk assessment; observation; intel support; counter-mobility; developer\/operator (DEVOPS), event correlation, and command and control (PEO EIS)\n-Garrison DCO Platform (GDP): Prepositioned, dedicated compute and storage resources residing at high\/extremely high risk installations. Provides cyberspace defenders a remote maneuver capability in order to augment and\/or support cyberspace defenders existing at designated bases, posts, camps, or stations by preserving an organization's ability to utilize mission critical data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems (PEO EIS)\n-Deployable DCO System (DDS): A deployable kit, with dedicated compute and storage for austere environments that do not have prepositioned infrastructure or locations for which prepositioned DCO resources do not provide adequate capacity. The DDS allows global cyberspace defenders (e.g. CPTs) the ability to jump into a network, physically, onsite and gain a position of advantage to augmenting organic local and\/or regional cyberspace defenders (PEO EIS)\n-User Activity Monitoring (UAM): The primary capability within the Army's overall insider threat detection (InT) program. UAM is a software-based, scalable solution that proactively identifies and mitigates internal risks associated with the theft and misuse of critical, mission essential data. UAM utilizes full-spectrum solutions to assess, deter, deny, defend, defeat, and evolve against the insider threat hub (PEO EIS)\n-Forensics and Malware Analysis (F&MA): Warfighting capability adheres to the global standard in digital investigation technology for global or regional cyberspace defenders who need to conduct efficient, forensically-sound, data collection and examination either remotely or locally using a repeatable and defensible process. Forensics gives cyberspace defenders the ability to  triage by quickly viewing and searching potential evidence in order to determine whether further examination is warranted (PEO EIS)\n-Advanced Sensors: Real-time discovery of specific advanced or sophisticated cyber threats and vulnerabilities on a critical system or segment of the network. Advanced sensors provides an automated monitoring and incident handling capability lower in the network architecture (access layer) to conduct over-watch for high-risk units or systems that normally operate out of view (\"last mile\") from traditional security or DCO measures (PEO EIS)\n-Threat Emulation: Software and hardware based suite of tools used by a Cyber OPFOR to gain access to evaluated networks and systems using multi-vectors of unknown (\"blackbox\"), partially known (\"graybox\"), or known (\"whitebox\") access methods. Enables the implementation of real world threat tactics, techniques, and procedures against risk areas in order to reveal extremely high-risk security exposures and demonstrate the operational impact of a potential attack (PEO EIS)\n-Counter Infiltration: Software\/hardware array of components that retrogrades mission critical assets from virtual areas under a cyber threat actor's control using stealth, deception, surprise, or clandestine movements. The capability allows commanders and leaders to trade space for time by slowing down the advanced persistent threat's without becoming decisively engaged (PEO EIS)\n-Forge: Provides integration and assessment capabilities during the development and integration phases of operations. DCO program will leverage non-FAR based Other Transaction Authorities (OTA) to solicit prototype\/new technologies for consideration of procurement decisions.\n-Rapid Cyber Prototyping: Rapidly develops cyber capabilities identified by the Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) in order to counter advanced, persistent, and sophisticated cyber threats (ARCYBER)"

The primary measure of effectiveness for an advanced cyber sensor is real-time discovery of specific advanced or sophisticated cyber threats and vulnerabilities on a critical system or segment of the network. When a TTP is detected, advanced sensors can execute a myriad of tailored response actions (block, neutralize, deceive, redirect, etc.) on the associated payload. The result is an increased ability to interrupt the adversary at the beginning of the cyber kill chain by employing counter-measures during the reconnaissance and weaponization phases; and neutralizing and\/or deceiving the adversary during the delivery, exploitation, and installation phases. To enable this approach, advanced cyber sensors incorporate indications and warnings (I&W) algorithmically to provide identification and reporting of time-sensitive information on developments that could involve a threat to the network."

The Army conducted Materiel Development Decisions (MDD) in FY18 based upon the DCO Information System Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD). DCO will develop and integrate the DCO Suite of Complimentary Systems (DSCS) using an incremental evolutionary acquisition approach that employs iterative development and acquisition reform principals, complying with the 1996 Clinger-Cohen Act. The approach leverages prototyping using the Operational Needs Statement (ONS) high-level objectives as a bridging strategy to establish the acquisition programs. The DSCS was initiated via four (4) ONSs, which have transitioned into Program of Records (PORs).\n\nSystem designs focus on open architecture and open source capabilities. Department will utilize Evolutionary Acquisition (Delivery, Assess, Deploy, Learn and Iterate). Implementation of a modular design to maximize innovation through continuous releases. Modules will be refined by industry as a component through adoption of prototypes. Each program will have a prime integrator (single contractor) that integrates the new modules. The Government will assess and create prototypes employing a combination of Government entities and commercial vendors via Other Transaction Authority contract vehicle.\n\nThe Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI) program's MDD was conducted in 2QFY18. Based on the validated DCO IS ICD and the TDI Requirements Definition Package (RDP), the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) delegating TDI as an ACAT III program. TDI will leverage the Simplified Acquisition Plan (SAMP) approach and will use acquisition tailoring in preparing for MSB, scheduled for 3QFY19. To support the Department's evolutionary acquisition approach, the TDI program office will develop the software infrastructure and deployment scripts that provide a technological solution that is converged with the Tactical Server Infrastructure in a series of incremental builds to deliver capabilities that align with DCO priorities. Execution of the TDI program will be a combination of government entities and commercial vendors."

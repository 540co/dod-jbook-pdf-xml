The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.\n\nNuclear terrorism is one of the most significant and pressing threats identified by national leadership.  A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  During the Deputy Management Advisory Group process shortfalls and resources to close these gaps were identified and supported by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems such as ground based prompt diagnostic systems and airborne sample collection systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of nuclear forensics. \n\nPer DoDD 2060.04 OSD AT&L NCB provides guidance and direction for the implementation of the Department of Defense National Technical Nuclear Forensics program.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but emphasizes post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post-detonation nuclear forensics capability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program."

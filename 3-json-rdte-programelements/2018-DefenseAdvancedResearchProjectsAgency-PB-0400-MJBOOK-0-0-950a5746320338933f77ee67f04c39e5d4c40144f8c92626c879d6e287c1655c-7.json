The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter.\n\nAdvances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority.  The Electronics Technology project therefore supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures.  Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors.  Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards.\n\nThis project also recognizes that phenomenal advancements in electronics will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, presenting a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. Beyond Scaling programs within the Electronics Technology project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware. These programs will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit  architectures, for instance by exploiting chip-scale heterogeneous integration of differing material technologies, using \"sticky logic\" devices that combine computation and memory functions, and vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices.\n\nThe project will also investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful devices, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low-cost, reliable, fast, and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  Rapid design and utilization of these new technologies will be a critical focus of ELT-01, as DoD looks for mechanisms to speed the development and fielding of advanced technologies.\n\nThis project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research."

The program aims to realize modular integrated circuits (ICs) that integrate designs using different commercial suppliers, silicon technologies, and compound semiconductor (CS) materials.  Although integrating CS and silicon has been shown to increase the performance of radio frequency devices, integration is both costly and time consuming.  CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of intellectual property (IP) blocks, including for CS and silicon materials, in the form of prefabricated chiplets.  The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers."

Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers.  DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of a ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers.

However, current phased array components are based on custom analog electronics, making them expensive to develop, difficult to upgrade, and time-consuming to deploy.  ACT will address this challenge by leveraging programmable, commercial-off-the-shelf, digital components that can undergo yearly technology refreshes in response to a continually changing threat environment.  This approach can dramatically reduce the time and cost required to develop and update DoD phased arrays.  Further, the ongoing cost reductions and performance improvements typical in the commercial sector could enable the DoD to place phased arrays on inexpensive platforms such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles where they have previously proven prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain."

HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  Opportunities for transferring HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the execution of the early phases of the program.  Technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur.

When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15."

Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.

These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.  WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time.  Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in the long-wave infrared thermal (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available.  However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR\/MWIR bands.  WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR\/MWIR.  The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art."

Specifically, MOABB aims to construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices.  These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems.  MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components.

CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months.  The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics.  To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies.  These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs.  CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes.  Finally, CRAFT will develop and validate various techniques for obscuring sensitive information during the IC manufacturing process, allowing DoD to leverage more of the available onshore semiconductor market.  These capabilities can help to ensure that the DoD has multiple potential suppliers for critical ICs and help keep military electronics at the leading edge."

Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare (EW); and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled.  By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations.  ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments.  Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability."

Practical application, however, has been limited.  Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities.  The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources.  The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal, preferably using the sensing mechanism to do this subtraction.  This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications.  In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and ultralow frequency (ULF) communications."

Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals.  Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  By contrast, existing RF transistor technologies amplify RF signals but produce undesired interference in the RF spectrum due to their poor linearity.  Traditional RF transistor design typically requires a trade-off between high linearity and broadcast range.  DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new ultra-wide band gap and high carrier mobility materials in novel transistor-level designs and highly-scaled transistor structures.  The resulting device technology should allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum while consuming less system power."

UAVs are currently powered by large, heavy chemical batteries or an engine, with associated liquid fuel.  This consumes a large percentage of the UAV's weight budget and places strict limitations on its range.  Wireless power transfer represents a paradigm-changing solution to power distribution by alleviating the need to carry all energy sources on-board, drastically reducing UAV weight, and increasing aircraft endurance.  Additional power can also be made available for the UAV's payload, allowing use of higher-functionality sensing and computing systems and enabling better data exploitation and threat response.  Previous wireless power transfer experiments have demonstrated delivery of over 30 kilowatts of power over a distance of one kilometer but have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitively large, meter-sized receivers required.  WAVPT will leverage recent advances in directed energy sources and beam-forming capabilities and develop new receiver architectures to demonstrate efficient wireless power transfer in a small form-factor.  Advanced semiconductor materials and processing techniques will be used to develop low-cost, centimeter-sized receivers with high efficiency and energy densities, enabling integration within a small platform.  The program will culminate with a demonstration of hundreds of watts of power being transferred from a ground-based transmitter to a UAV at least one kilometer away.  The technology that is developed within this program can break the inherent tradeoff between mission duration and weight for unmanned vehicles and transform next-generation military systems."

These hurdles limit DoD s ability to rapidly access high-performance electronic components and encourage the use of sub-optimal or insecure alternatives. IDEA would reduce the cost and expertise barriers to IC design by leveraging 50 years of chip design knowledge, ongoing advances in machine intelligence, and the incredible growth in public, cloud-based computational resources. The program would develop evolvable, open-source IC design tools and IC building block libraries that can be stored in publicly available cloud infrastructure. This would enable small teams of system and algorithm experts without chip design experience to develop custom ICs at a very low cost and quickly implement these designs in hardware.

Goals of the ART program include (1) developing a technology base enabling future radios to survey and adapt to the electromagnetic environment; (2) enabling the rapid deployment of radios in response to changing operational requirements; and (3) significantly reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of such radios.  ART will enable the use of a single design pathway for multiple, unique radio frequency (RF) systems, thus dramatically reducing military procurement and sustainment costs.  ART will also advance the hardware and software used in radio frequency (RF) systems by developing a flexible, reconfigurable architecture that can adapt to various RF waveforms."

DAHI, however, builds on previous DARPA and commercial efforts, which demonstrated that heterogeneously integrating CS and silicon can yield significant performance improvements over silicon or CS alone.  DAHI's applied research program focuses on developing and demonstrating high-performance SOC for DoD-specific applications.  The program should also enhance the manufacturing yield and reliability of heterogeneous integration capabilities and demonstrate innovative, advanced microsystems that leverage heterogeneous integration.

To support this new class of electronics and mechanical structures, VAPR will develop and establish an initial set of transient materials and components along with the required manufacturing processes.  The resulting systems should perform comparably to commercial-off-the-shelf systems while demonstrating system transience that can be programmed, adjusted, triggered, or made to respond to the deployment environment.  VAPR technologies will be demonstrated through two final test platforms.  A vanishing air delivery vehicle capable of precise, gentle drops of small payloads (~3 lbs.) seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of transient structural materials.  A sensor with a wireless link seeks to demonstrate the manufacturability of transient electronics.  Both demonstrations are intended to fully function on their own and to serve as a leading indicator of the potential systems and concepts-of-operation that VAPR could enable."

Today, RF links are allocated and confined to slices of spectrum to prevent interference among users; this however facilitates enemy attempts to jam the link.  HERMES explored a combination of techniques to suppress enemy jammers and guarantee communications in situations where the RF link is critical.  Technology developed under the HERMES program enabled RF links to access tremendous amounts of bandwidth without jeopardizing other links.  Advances under the HERMES program will prove increasingly important given the growing dependence of modern weapons systems on RF links for communications, command and control, geolocation and battle management."

            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, as well as combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides virtually 100 percent of the consumable items the military services need to operate \u2013 including food, uniforms, fuel and energy, medical supplies, construction and barrier materials and equipment, and more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts.  DLA also provides logistics services including logistics information data, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and documents automation and production services. DLAs Logistics Research and Development (Log R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are used to accomplish the agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure.  Log R&D identifies the best commercial business practices and tailors them, as necessary, into the most effective business processes for the agency.  Log R&D develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at the lowest possible costs. \n\nThe DLA Log R&D program is organized into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs):\n\u2022 Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (EAMD): R&D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.  \n\u2022 Improving Logistics Processes (ILP): R&D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.\n\u2022 Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements (ELR): R&D efforts to support emergent Logistics R&D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  This SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA scope includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes."

A portion of the MLN budget was realigned to other R&D efforts due to no specific projects identified.  Assessments are currently being conducted for viable R&D projects for the budgeted amounts.\n\nThe R&D Strategic Distribution & Disposition (SDD) Program collaborates with DLA Distribution and Disposition Services to identify capability shortfalls (gaps) that allow the opportunity to address these shortfalls through major applied research efforts and to further improve operational effectiveness and efficiency in support of Warfighter\u2019s requirements. A key objective of the SDD Program is to infuse innovative solutions into distribution and disposition operations that address inadequate legacy capabilities and the challenges of future worldwide distribution, disposition, reutilization, and retrograde requirements."

This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs. In the past DLA R&D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times. Saving the lead-time allows the agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs. The Program will initiate the Advanced Thermoelectric Technology project to improve the current thermoelectric heater technology so it is more fuel-efficient, has an increased heating range, reduced maintenance requirements, and a longer service life. The Advanced Thermoelectric Heater will replace the existing Space Heater Convective standard heaters currently stocked at DLA, and will provide DoD a single, versatile heater that reduces the logistics footprint and satisfies the space heating requirements of expeditionary forces. Additionally, SCM will support DLA Strategic Materials with one or more cost saving opportunities that exist for DLA via recycling and recovery initiatives.\n\nIn FY18, the AM project will be funded under PE 0603680S \/ Manufacturing Technology Program (ManTech) Project 7 - Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (formerly Material Availability). This realignment will maintain continuity of funding and activity for this program.\n\nERP will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers."

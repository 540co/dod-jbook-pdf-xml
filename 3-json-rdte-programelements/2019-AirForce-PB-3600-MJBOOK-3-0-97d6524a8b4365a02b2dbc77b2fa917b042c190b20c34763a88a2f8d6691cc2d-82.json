The SEWS continues to provide Theater Combatant Commanders and foreign nation customers direct operational benefit by improving the architectural design and equipment thereby providing enhanced mission capabilities (i.e., expanded coverage, emerging capability integration, etc.). Foreign customer arrangements are negotiated with individual countries on a bilateral basis to provide selected region-specific missile warning information. SEWS Integration and Test facility is kept current by enhancing systems to improve analysis of real world events.  To enhance mission capability the SEWS program tests message format updates, cross domain solution updates, mandatory crypto upgrades, SEWS integration with other warning systems, and the transition to \"coalition-based\" warning.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThe North Warning System (NWS) is composed of 1970s era radar systems. The existing radar technology is quickly approaching obsolescence with regards to future threats.\n\nIn FY 2018, PE 0308699F, Shared Early Warning (SEW) efforts were transferred to PE 1203699F, Shared Early Warning (SEW) due to the creation of a new Major Force Program for Space. FY 2017 funding is now documented in the exhibits for PE 1203699F.\n\nIn FY 2019, no funding is requested and no funding is required as all SEWS development will be complete.\n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

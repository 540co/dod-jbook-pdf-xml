                            "val": "This Program Element (PE) describes the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative. This program was originally established in the 1990s in response to the NDAA (FY99, Section 378 of Public Law 105-261) and granted additional authorities via Executive Orders (e.g., EO 13111) and other supporting publications (e.g., 10 U.S. Code \u00a72249d). The ADL Initiative supports innovation and provides policy oversight to help the Services, Joint Staff, and partner agencies deliver their training and education more efficiently and cost effectively\u2014anytime, anywhere. ADL provides policy oversight and coordination across DoD, Coalition partners, and other Federal agencies for distributed learning. Ultimately, this work supports DoD\u2019s training and education mission, increases personnel readiness, saves resources, ensures the right people receive the right training and education, at the right time, and at the right cost, and facilitates interorganizational interoperability. Organizationally, this PE reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&T)). \n\nThis PE provides policy oversight and guidance for distributed learning (e.g., online courses, smartphone-based learning, web browser\u2013based simulations) and supports associated innovation, modernization, and coordination across DoD, Coalition partners (e.g., NATO), and other federal agencies. This work focuses on distributed learning interoperability (i.e., ensuring interagency technical and organizational systems function together), supports interagency\/interorganizational coordination for its implementation, and helps agencies acquire new distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiency. \n\nThis PE\u2019s work falls into three interrelated categories: (1) Modernization, (2) Documentation, and (3) Coordination. The \u201cmodernization\u201d work involves Advanced Technology Development (6.3) in technical areas such as e-learning, mobile learning, learner modeling and analytics, and software interoperability. These efforts inform the PE\u2019s \u201cdocumentation\u201d work, including the authoring and upkeep of technical guidance and policy documents, such as DoD Instruction 1322.26 (\u201cDistributed Learning\u201d) and software interoperability specifications. Finally, the documentation work drives \u201ccoordination\u201d efforts, which consist of implementation support and interagency\/interorganizational coordination. \n\nThis PE\u2019s modernization investments are driven by requirements collected from the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, a working group of military personnel and DoD\/federal civilians (at the O-6 and GS-15 level) who represent their agencies\u2019 distributed learning equities and are key stakeholders in shaping the direction of these agencies (refer to DoDI 1322.26). These requirements are also aligned to DoD\/federal strategic direction, such as the Army Learning Concept for Training and Education for 2020\u20132040 (TP 525-8-2), Navy\u2019s Sailor 2025, and Air Force Strategic Master Plan, and they are considered against emerging industry trends and technologies. \n\nThis PE benefits DoD in three ways. (1) Interoperability: It strengthens interagency, interorganizational, and multinational interoperability by governing distributed learning interoperability policy, maintaining current technical reference guidelines, and fostering their implementation across communities of practice. (2) Efficiencies: It saves government resources by fostering unity of effort across DoD, other federal agencies, and Coalition Partners for distributed learning, eliminating duplications and identifying opportunities for interagency collaboration. (3) Learning Effectiveness: It helps improve training and education effectiveness by helping DoD, federal, and Coalition stakeholders acquire and implement emerging distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiently. In sum, this work supports the components\u2019 training and education missions, helping them increase personnel readiness while driving down training and education portfolio costs."

This program is supporting its development by investigating the specifications and web-based digital services needed to make training and education technologies interoperable. In FY17, an early \u201cTotal Learning Architecture\u201d prototype was tested with 75 Special Operators at Ft. Bragg. In FY18, this project will enter its second phase of development and will include additional empirical testing. \n\nLearning Data \u2013 In FY17, this program led a revision to DoD Instruction 1322.26, after extensive coordination with the Services and Joint Staff. The revised Instruction recommends the use of the Experience Application Programming Interface (xAPI), a technical specification that enables data exchange across training and education technologies. In FY18, this program will continue to refine the xAPI specification for semantic interoperability and will coordinate with stakeholders to deliver the implementation guidance, conformance testing tools, learning analytics, and data visualization capabilities they need to make most use of it. In FY18, this work is also expected to inform updates to DoD Instruction 1322.26\u2019s fungible technical references.\n\nCompetencies and Credentialing \u2013 In FY17, this program investigated competency and credentialing management technologies, and it prototyped a web-based competency framework tool as part of the Total Learning Architecture demonstration. In FY18, this PE will continue its coordination efforts across defense and federal agencies for competency-based learning, and it will continue working with professional specifications and standards bodies in development of associated interoperability specifications to aid permeability across organizational boundaries. \n\nPersonal Assistant for Learning \u2013 Adaptive learning tools promise to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of training and education, and these tools are critical parts of DoD\u2019s modern \u201clearning ecosystem\u201d vision. This program examines the science and technology needed to design such capabilities, using open-architecture and open-source methods. In FY17, this PE successfully tested several frameworks, including a smartphone-based system with Defense Language students and a table-based e-book capability with Special Operators. In FY18, this program plans to work with other agencies to transition some of these capabilities into operational use, coordinate with professional specifications and standards bodies to author relevant technical guidelines, and to continue development of these emerging capabilities. \n\nInteragency and Interorganizational Coordination \u2013 In FY17, this program provided distributed learning modernization support to more than 40 defense agencies (e.g., The Army Distributed Learning Program, Naval Education and Training Command, Air Education and Training Command, Marine Corps Training and Education Command, Joint Knowledge Online, Defense Acquisition University), more than 15 international partners (e.g., NATO, The Technical Cooperation Program, Partnership for Peace Consortium), and other federal agencies (e.g., National Park Service, Customs and Border Protection). In FY18, this program will continue to coordinate with these stakeholders and with relevant working groups, such as the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government."

Integrate research efforts and findings, as necessary into updates to the DoDI 1322.26.\n\n2.\tTotal Learning Architecture \u2013 Research and development activities for this spiral of TLA will provide the ability to adapt across learning trajectories, careers, and experiences. It also incorporates various activity providers, as traditional e-learning content, a browser-based concept-map assessment application, e-book, micro-learning activities, a computer-based serious game, and a physical instructor-led learning activity. This work continues to coincide with the emerging DoD-wide learning technology reform efforts.\n\n3.\tLearner Science \u2013 Collaborate with operational defense training and education organizations to help them evolve effective learning methodologies and solutions. Implement prototype capability through empirical and theoretical analysis of neuroscience, cognitive science, instructional design, data analytics, anthropology, linguistics, computer science, psychology, and education. Use data and information to develop learning data interoperability specifications, learning analytics, and visualization capabilities. Ongoing efforts will also continue to inform the DoD Instruction 1322.26\u2019s fungible technical references.\n\n4.\tCompetency and Credential Management \u2013 Continue coordinate efforts across defense and federal agencies for competency-based learning, with the associated technical guidance potentially informing DoD Instruction 1322.26\u2019s fungible technical references. Evolve a robust set of data, metadata, and interaction specifications to represent competencies and competency frameworks. Desired outcomes include evolution of an effective reference implementation of enterprise competency and credential management supporting DoD learning ecosystems; including refinement of a data strategy and associated lifecycle that builds on a solid foundation for expansion of TLA.\n\n5.\tPersonal Assistant for Learning \u2013 PERvasive Learning System (PERLS) transition, sustainment and formalization as an R&D project subprogram. PERLS allows capitalization of \u201cwhite space\u201d outside of formal learning activities and training exercises.\n\n6.\tInteragency and Interorganizational Coordination \u2013 Continue coordination with defense, federal, and international stakeholders, and with relevant working groups, such as the Defense ADL Advisory Committee and NATO Training Group, to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government."

Typical metrics include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged by other defense and federal agencies, the increase in the number of interoperable training and education digital systems, the impact of these efforts on defense\/federal strategic planning, and downstream reductions in training and education portfolio costs. \n\nDOCUMENTATION: For the policy and documentation efforts, metrics include at-least annual update of published guidance, ensuring the documentation adheres to current technical\/industry standards. The policy and documentation utility are also judged based upon its use, including both number of vendors adopting the policy and number of defense\/federal acquisition efforts adhering to the guidance.\n\nCOORDINATION: For the interagency and interorganizational coordination efforts, performance is first measured based upon the number of agencies, international organizations, and professional groups directly supported. Success is measured based upon the number of requirements consolidated across defense and federal stakeholders, an increase in partnering between agencies for distributed learning resource sharing, and, ultimately, in improved return on investment for distributed learning efforts."

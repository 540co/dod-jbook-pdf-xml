Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command, joint, and Military Service capability needs and research initiatives. The CWMD Systems program supports the National Defense Strategy objective of \u201cdissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition to fielded capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and guidance for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies, modifying existing systems, and utilizing technology-enabled analytical cells to provide support to Combatant Commands and other joint and Service commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nDuring FY 2018 and FY 2019 the CWMD Systems program utilized four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

The purpose is to develop, build, and test systems, verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and support product development decisions.\n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

            "val": "In FY2021, PE 1206422F, Weather System Follow-On efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1206422SF Weather System Follow-On from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 04 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nBased on completion of the Space-Based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM) Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Memo 092-14, capabilities will be developed to satisfy weather gaps for which no known mitigation exists. Weather System Follow-on (WSF) is a component of SBEM efforts to develop capabilities to satisfy weather Gap 3 Ocean Surface Vector Winds (OSVW), Gap 8 Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI), and Gap 11 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Energetic Charged Particles (LEO ECP). Gap 3 OSVW and Gap 8 TCI require a space-based microwave sensor to provide polarimetric ocean surface wind direction and speed required for naval sea operations, as well as fighter sortie generations and marine amphibious operations. Gap 11 LEO ECP requires in situ ECP sensor for space situational awareness. The earliest possible launch options are being integrated in the design for critical gaps.\n\nDoD established WSF as a Pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) with the Air force as the lead component. Based on the SBEM AoA results, the WSF initial\nthrusts will be to enable:\n1) DoD use of data collected by civil, international and other DoD space systems;\n2) Timely weather collection over broad oceans in support of maneuvering forces;\n3) Space weather capabilities to characterize operational orbits, space situational awareness, and the ionosphere.\n\nSecondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the SBEM AoA and validated by the JROC.\n\nThe Military Application of the Space Environment (MASE) is a program to demonstrate mature space environment technology to improve combat operations. MASE will enhance regional ionospheric specification (nowcasts) and predictions (forecasts) affecting signal propagation paths. MASE uses traditional and non-traditional ionospheric measurements in advanced space environment models to forecast and predict impacts to weapon systems. Contributes to satisfying Gaps 4 and 7 of the SBEM AoA results as supplemented by the AFRDM 02-17-02 (SBEM JDCR). MASE was a new start in FY 2019.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships,and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop\nnew or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WSF weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Weather System Follow-on (WSF) is a component of SBEM efforts to develop capabilities to satisfy weather Gap 3 Ocean Surface Vector Winds (OSVW), Gap 8 Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI), and Gap 11 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Energetic Charged Particles (LEO ECP). Gap 3 OSVW and Gap 8 TCI require a space-based microwave sensor to provide polarimetric ocean surface wind direction and speed required for naval sea operations, as well as fighter sortie generations and marine amphibious operations. Gap 11 LEO ECP requires in situ ECP sensor for space situational awareness. The earliest possible launch options are being integrated in the design for critical gaps.\n\nDoD established WSF as a Pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) with the Air force as the lead component.  Based on the SBEM AoA results, the WSF initial thrusts will be to enable:  \n1) DoD use of data collected by civil, international and other DoD space systems; \n2) Timely weather collection over broad oceans in support of maneuvering forces; \n3) Space weather capabilities to characterize operational orbits, space situational awareness, and the ionosphere. \n\nSecondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the SBEM AoA and validated by the JROC. \n\nThe Military Application of the Space Environment (MASE) is a program to demonstrate mature space environment technology to improve combat operations. MASE will enhance regional ionospheric specification (nowcasts) and predictions (forecasts) affecting signal propagation paths. MASE uses traditional and non-traditional ionospheric measurements in advanced space environment models to forecast and predict impacts to weapon systems. Contributes to satisfying Gaps 4 and 7 of the SBEM AoA results as supplemented by the AFRDM 02-17-02 (SBEM JDCR). MASE was a new start in FY 2019.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WSF weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F."

The acquisition strategy for WSF is based on validated SBEM AoA results from FY2014 and subsequent acquisition strategy development activities that were conducted in FY 2015.  The WSF acquisition strategy focuses on streamlined acquisition process for providing materiel solutions to OSVW, TCI & LEO ECP, as validated by the JROC; deliver microwave sensing solution to address DoD needs for OSVW and TCI capabilities and deliver space environment sensing solution to address LEO ECP capabilities for on-orbit attributions and anomaly resolutions.  \n\nThe Air Force is conducting a technology demonstration of the Compact Ocean Surface Wind Vector Radiometer (COWVR) sensor in partnership with NASA Space Test Program (STP) to launch and integrate with International Space Station (ISS), utilizing their unique technology demonstration capabilities for on-orbit demonstration of COWVR technology.  SMC's STP is the leading AF organization spearheading the NASA partnership, while SMC\/DCIF is responsible for the COWVR project and funding and providing programmatic support to enable COWVR sensor to ISS integration\/technology demonstration.\n\nThe program awarded a contract for WSF satellite, capable of meeting all three weather capability gaps, in a full and open competition environment, in order to reduce overall program cost.  The Air Force is procuring one WSF-M satellite with an option for a second satellite.  WSF-M first satellite (SV-1) ILC is FY 2024 to mitigate any potential weather coverage gaps.  WSF-M SV-2 ILC is currently projected for FY 2028.  The WSF SV-2 will be functionally equivalent to SV-1.  Naval Research Lab Blossom Point Tracking Facility (BPTF) will be used as a viable unclassified EGS-compatible SOC for WSF-M. BPTF consists of a satellite mission operations center, multiple ground antennas including via AFSCN, and an existing infrastructure capable of providing space system command, control, and communications (C3). \n\nThe WSF ECP sensor development will leverage current AFRL sensor and hazard assessment technology to accelerate availability of ECP sensor for integration on WSF-M and other planned AF satellite acquisitions.  The AF intends to transition AFRL's technology to industry for production via competitive award.  Two Tech Demo ECP sensors are projected to be delivered and ready for satellite integration by FY 2022.  Post-Tech Demo ECP phase, each respective program offices will be responsible for the procurement\/integration and sustainment of the sensors required to meet the SecAF's Space Situational Awareness (SSA) policy.\n\nThe program intends to continue research and development at AFRL to support the MASE baseline. Features to enhance and improve MASE related prototypes\/models will be added through capability drops while maintaining Risk Management Framework compliance.  Award contracts to conduct studies and perform technical analysis for external data sources and optimal sensor laydown, system development and external system integration. Conduct field campaigns to validate scientific algorithms. Provision cloud services, deploy ionospheric ground sensors and provide program office support."

The FoS will include both the recapitalization of current capabilities of the existing air wing and development of new capabilities for 2035 mission success across multiple domains.  This program provides analytical support to the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations as a basis for major policy, planning and acquisition program execution decisions and provides the initial airframe, avionics, and power\/propulsion efforts to develop and field the FoS necessary to replace the United States Navy's F\/A-18E\/F Super Hornet.  It supports research and development strategy development and planning and supports studies in the areas of manpower, personnel, training, and aviation.   It also develops and delivers Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Acquisition Plans and all supporting documents and security classification guides\/program protection plans.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

It will mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability across the Spectrum of Conflict. The AMPV will replace five mission roles currently performed by the M113 FoV by transferring the current M113 Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) to a new Military Vehicle Derivative (MVD) platform. In total, the AMPV FOV will account for approximately 30% of the ABCT's tracked fleet and consists of the following five variants:\n\n1.  Mission Command (MCmd) Vehicle: This platform enables effective mission command planning and execution for both the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and Tactical Command Vehicle (TAC) versions of the MCmd. It will host current Battle Command Systems, future replacements, and upgrades of hardware and software.\n2.  Medical Treatment (MT) Vehicle: This platform will provide a protected surgical environment, with adequate lighting and accessible medical equipment. It will provide a capability for immediate medical care for one patient by a medical crew of four.\n3.  Medical Evacuation (ME) Vehicle: This platform will conduct ambulance type activities and provide casualty evacuation for up to four litter or six ambulatory patients, with a crew of three medical attendants.\n4.  General Purpose (GP) Vehicle: This platform will operate throughout the battle space by conducting re-supply, maintenance, casualty evacuation, and other tasks within the formation.\n5.  Mortar Carrier (MC) Vehicle: This platform will provide immediate responsive fire support to conduct fast-paced offensive operations.\n\nThe AMPV program has been initiated on the basis of a Capability Development Document (CDD) that was approved on 21 June 2013. The CDD reflects a set of stable, technologically achievable requirements. A Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was held on 9 December 2014 and it was followed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) that was signed on 22 December 2014. The ADM approved MS B for the AMPV program and entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. In addition, the ADM authorized the Army to proceed with award of the EMD prime contract, which occurred on 23 December 2014 to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, L.P. (BAE).

The prime contractor supported team meetings and reviews and reported program progress through the use of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Technical Performance Measures (TPMs). Based on successful completion of the PDR, activities transitioned to detailed design of components and subsystems in FY2016. These detailed design efforts were focused on integration of existing components into the AMPV chassis, which were tailored to the five mission roles. Final prototype designs and related drawings were completed in FY2016. In addition, as nearly all of the subsystems that will be integrated into the prototype structures will be existing designs, most of the hardware at a component level was ordered 3-4QFY2016. Integration of these components into subsystems commenced 4QFY2016 and were mostly complete by 1-2QFY2017. Prototype final integration, assembly, and checkout were initiated to allow full vehicle prototypes to begin to be delivered late 1QFY2017. In addition to prototype development and fabrication, the engineering work was focused on the Critical Design Review (CDR), which took place 21-23 June 2016. All artifacts that supported CDR were delivered to the government prior to the review. Approximately 50 artifacts were delivered in support of CDR. Government Furnished Material for the system prototypes, mainly consisting of Mission Equipment Packages and communication hardware, was procured 2-3QFY2016. Final builds for armor coupons and ballistic hull test articles were completed to support live fire\/survivability testing in FY17."

In addition, for each of the first 5 prototype vehicles, the prime contractor will conduct 1,500 miles of shakedown testing prior to beginning government run system level tests. Also related to the prototype vehicles, the prime contractor will deliver and manage System Support Packages (SSPs) that consist of the necessary spare parts required to facilitate government testing. From an engineering perspective, the prime contractor will make informed design changes to respond to hardware and software upgrades and CDD updates, as well as utilize knowledge gained from system level testing to update vehicle designs, as required. Any updates will be presented in an Interim Design Review (IDR), currently planned for early 2QFY2018. In addition, the Vehicle Tactical Integration Lab (VTIL) and the Computer Software Integration Lab (CSIL) will continue to be used to trouble-shoot any emerging issues and, if necessary, verify design updates. During FY2017, the final three software builds will be delivered. These builds are primarily expected to be clean-up builds that will resolve any problems uncovered during system level testing.  The prime contractor will perform significant work related to Logistics\/Product Support in FY2017. This will include an update to the Level of Repair Analysis (LORA), provisioning of repair parts, development of packaging information, training at test sites, and the validation of technical manual tasks in preparation for the Logistics Demonstration starting in 2QFY2018. Logistics related documentation to be completed by BAE in FY2017 includes the Logistics Demonstration Plan, System Demilitarization and Disposal Plan, Preservation and Storage of Unique Tooling, Core Logistics Assessment, Core Depot Assessment, Depot Source of Repair, and Analysis of Product Support Alternatives."

In addition, the contractor will continue work related to Logistics\/Product Support. All 29 prototypes will undergo testing in FY2018, with tests often occurring simultaneously at multiple locations. The contractor will support these tests by providing Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to assist in repairing and maintaining the prototypes and by providing Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to troubleshoot any issues that might arise during testing. As required, the contractor will update the AMPV designs to address any shortcomings that are uncovered during testing or to incorporate any updates to government performance requirements. A Corrective Action Period (CAP) is planned for late 1QFY2018 through late 2QFY2018. During the CAP, the contractor will incorporate any design changes that are deemed necessary. An Interim Design Review (IDR) will be conducted at the conclusion of the CAP. The IDR will demonstrate that design changes made after the CDR are baselined and the system design is ready for manufacturing. A minimum of seventeen (17) artifacts will be generated by the contractor in support of IDR. Additional system level testing will take place following the CAP. At least 9,950 miles (not including contractor shakedown testing) will accrue during formal government testing prior to the CAP and at least an additional 9,500 miles will accrue following the CAP. Following completion of the post-CAP system level tests, a Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) will occur 4QFY2018. During the FCA, the contractor will demonstrate that the as-tested performance of the vehicles complies with design and interface requirements. Immediately following the FCA, the contractor will support the Limited User Test (LUT) in 4QFY2018. Eighteen (18) of the prototypes will be used during the LUT and the contractor will support the test by having FSRs and Test Engineers (TEs) on site and SMEs on call. Besides ensuring that the prototypes are adequately supported before and during testing, the contractor will provide all facilities, parts, tools, and other support items necessary to conduct a Logistics Demonstration (Log Demo) 2-4QFY2018. The contractor will validate the logistics support package prior to the Log Demo and will ensure that the nine (9) primary objectives of the Log Demo are achieved. The first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract option covers 52 vehicles, 10 of which (2 of each variant type) will support Full-Up System Level (FUSL) live fire testing. The recurring manufacturing cost associated with these 10 live fire assets will be Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funded, while the remaining 42 vehicles will be Procurement funded. Further, the live fire testing is scheduled to begin 2QFY2020 and the lead times associated with select hardware, such as electronic components, is expected to be such that some items must be procured as early as 3QFY2018. In accordance with the Full Funding Policy, the entire procurement cost of the live fire test assets is being budgeted in the fiscal year in which select items are initially procured. Accordingly, the FY2018 cost in this element includes the full recurring manufacturing cost necessary to procure 10 FUSL live fire test assets."

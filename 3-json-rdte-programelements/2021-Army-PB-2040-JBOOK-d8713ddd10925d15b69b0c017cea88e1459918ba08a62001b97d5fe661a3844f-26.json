AMF radios were planned to ensure the Soldier's ability to communicate both horizontally and vertically via voice and data within all mission areas and Common Operating Environment.  AMF radios were planned to operate waveforms that are deployed by Joint Forces today, and would have introduced networking waveforms to the Aviation community that would have enabled interoperability between air and ground forces and transport operational and Mission Command information through the tactical network.  AMF radios were planned to help close capability gaps by extending data networking to company and below echelons, enabling network services to the platform and connecting Army Aviation platforms to Army ground and Joint air network domains. \n\nOn 17 July 18, the Army Acquisition Executive signed both the SANR Closeout Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) and SANR Termination plan.  The ADM and plan initiated a program termination action and directed an orderly shutdown of the SANR program.  \n\nThe SANR subprogram (Project EG6) has no approved requirement and all SANR funding has been withdrawn in FY 2020 and beyond."

On May 2, 2014, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, issued an ADM that designated Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) and Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) as subprograms under the AMF Program. In FY 2015, Project EA9 represented the total Airborne Maritime Fixed Small Airborne (AMF-SA, or SALT) RDT&E budget.

The SANR was planned as a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency Type 1 certified networking radio providing seamless real-time information for operation in mobile and dynamic combat environments to meet tactical communications requirements as validated by the Army Aviation community.  SANR was planned to provide increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms via advanced networking capabilities supporting Mid-Tier and Lower Tier tactical networks, and maintain Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capability.  SANR was planned to replace the current SINCGARS radios on Army Aviation platforms.  SANR was planned for implementation on the following platforms: Apache (AH-64E), Black Hawk (UH-60V, UH-60M, HH-60M, and MH-60M), Chinook (CH-47F and MH-47G), and Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (MQ-1C) aircraft.  SANR was planned to enhance and further enable the ability of the maneuver commander to integrate and synchronize aviation forces with land based operational forces. SANR, was planned to be employed on Army aviation platforms, enable aviation combat elements (Combat Aviation Brigades, Theater Aviation Brigades, and Special Operations Aviation Regiment) to better utilize the inherent versatility of airborne communications as a complement to the unique capabilities of the other combat arms.  SANR planned to provide commanders enhanced Situational Awareness and Mission Command in a package that provides a more responsive means of directing aircraft to match changing maneuver forces situations and missions.\n\nOn 17 July 18, the Army Acquisition Executive signed both the SANR Closeout Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) and SANR Termination plan.

Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 2009.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOTE) on 12 Jun 2015.\n\nThis RDTE element funds a propulsion reliability improvement with the development of the Heavy Fuel Engine (HFE) 2.0 engine system.  The current MQ-1C aircraft engine has experienced material failures that have resulted in aircraft mishaps (loss of aircraft) and a high number lost flight hours due to Return to Base (RTB) events.  HFE 2.0 implements aviation grade components and focused reliability improvements that will address previous material failures and RTB drivers.  Additionally, the Army was notified by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that the current engine core is obsolete and the current manufacture will no longer supply the engine core.   HFE 2.0 also resolves this obsolescence\/supply issue.  In 2018, the Army issued an RFI to industry to assess the state of engine technology and availability of a COTS\/NDI engine solution that could meet MQ-1C capability needs and requirements.  The primary goal of the RFI was to establish an alternative engine for MQ-1C that is reliable and could be integrated and qualified in a two year timeframe to resolve critical reliability and supply issues with the current engine.  Upon completion of the RFI evaluations, an industry day event was held with all vendors to answer questions and gain additional information from each potential vendor in key areas such as reliability, cost and schedule.   As a result of the Army's RFI and Industry day event, it was determined that the HFE 2.0 was the only engine to meet requirements for an alternative MQ-1C engine.  Funded RDTE elements will support completion of integration, test, and qualification of the HFE 2.0 engine system on the MQ-1C aircraft.  This effort will secure engine supply and result in greater propulsion system reliability and increased operational readiness to the commander in the field.  Funds are planned for award on the Gray Eagle Technical Services contract as a Technical Services Memorandum (TSM) task order, and as a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requisitions (MIPRs) to various other Government agencies.  Upon completion of qualification, HFE 2.0 engine systems will be procured under the PBL contract and fielded through attrition."

The EGS capability will become the primary ground command and control (C2) suite of services for the Space Force Space Enterprise to meet evolving current and future space domain demands. EGS is based on Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) C2 capabilities developed under the Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program. \n\nThe EGS C2 program will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and resiliency in space program systems. EGS will focus efforts on the rapid development and deployment of tactical C2 services, developing and integrating on-premises and cloud infrastructure and laboratories at multiple sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cyber security development and implementation. Programs and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats. Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.\n\nOver the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) EGS will be developing and deploying C2 services and software applications that support transitioning legacy and new missions such as Missile Warning, Missile Defense, MILSATCOM, Space Situational Awareness and various classified and experimental satellites and missions to the EGS open architecture.  The modifications to core software applications provided by EGS are being made in an Agile DevSecOps environment, which has been fundamentally designed into EGS since its inception. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThe program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EGS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Leverage the two SBIR Phase 3 contracts that were awarded in late FY 2019 to scale EGS capabilities and enable more rapid development and deployment of tactical C2 services to operational users."

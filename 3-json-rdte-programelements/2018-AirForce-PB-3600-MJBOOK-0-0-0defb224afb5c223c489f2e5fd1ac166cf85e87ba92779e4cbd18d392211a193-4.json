            "val": "This program investigates, develops, and analyzes aerospace vehicle technologies in the three primary areas of structures, controls, and aerodynamics for legacy and future aerospace vehicles. Advanced structures concepts are explored and developed to exploit new materials, fabrication processes, and design techniques. Vehicle, inter-vehicle, and intra-vehicle control technologies are developed and simulated for aerospace vehicles. Advanced aerodynamic vehicle configurations are developed and analyzed through simulations, experiments, and multi-disciplinary analyses. Resulting technologies improve performance of existing and future manned and remotely piloted air vehicles, sustained high speed, and space access vehicles. Improvements include, but are not limited to, reduced energy use by efficient air platform designs, use of lightweight composite structures, and improved sustainment methods based on the condition of the platform and sub-systems. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

Evaluate interactions between air flow and structural deformations for a complex built-up hypersonic inlet.  Continue to mature critical technologies for high speed\/hypersonic flight. Continue development of design\/analysis techniques\/ tools and experimental approaches to enable enhanced high-speed air induction system starting, operability, and performance for propulsion integration concepts over a wide range of flight conditions. Continue development of high speed system concepts that provide revolutionary capabilities. Continue investigation of aeromechanic technologies to reduced drag and enable robust stability and control at low dynamic pressure flight conditions. Continue efforts to characterize high-speed phenomena and develop and validate fundamental high- speed technologies through experimental testing. As part of international collaborative effort, complete flight testing of Mach 6 adaptive guidance and control flight experiment and initiate boundary layer transition flight experiment program. Continue assessment of mission-level effectiveness and refinement of definition of preferred high speed weapon alternatives and limited life hypersonic intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance vehicles. Continue assessment of campaign-level benefits of preferred high speed weapon alternatives."

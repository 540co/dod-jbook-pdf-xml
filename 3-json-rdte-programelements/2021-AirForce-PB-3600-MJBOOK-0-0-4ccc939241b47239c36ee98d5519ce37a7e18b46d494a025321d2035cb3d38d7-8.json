Advances in aerospace sensors are required to increase combat effectiveness by providing anytime, anywhere surveillance, reconnaissance, precision targeting, and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities. To achieve this progress, this program pursues simultaneous advances in: 1) generating, controlling, receiving, and processing electronic and photonic signals for radio frequency (RF) sensor aerospace applications; 2) electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) aerospace sensor technologies for a variety of offensive and defensive uses; 3) radio frequency antennas and associated electronics for airborne and space surveillance, together with active and passive electro-optical\/infrared sensors; 4) technologies to manage and fuse on-board sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness; 5) technology for affordable, trusted, and reliable, all-weather surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike radio frequency sensors and electronic combat systems; and 6) technologies that aid in the development of agile and resilient mission systems. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

The enabling technologies developed under this project will be used for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, battlespace access, and precision engagement capabilities. The technologies developed include exploratory electronic and optoelectronic devices, components, microsystems and subsystems.  \n\nThis project also assesses designs, develops, fabricates, and demonstrates the associated technologies for integrating combinations of these component technologies. The project demonstrates significantly smaller size, lower weight, lower cost, lower power dissipation, higher reliability, trustworthiness and improved performance. The device and subsystem technology developments under this project are military unique; they are based on Air Force and other Department of Defense weapon systems requirements in the areas of radar, communications, electronic warfare, positioning, navigation, timing, and smart weapons."

One of the project's goals is to improve electro-optical and related technologies for the detection, tracking, and identification of non-cooperative and difficult targets, such as those obscured by camouflage or acquired at great range.  This project also develops the passive and active imaging sensors and algorithms needed to enable precision targeting in severe weather. These technologies are critical to future aerospace surveillance and targeting.  Other project goals include advanced electro-optical threat warning and countermeasures."

This project conducts exploratory investigations to determine technology feasibility and estimate operational capability constraints associated with missions in future contested and highly contested operating environments, using cooperative and non-cooperative sensing sources.  This project develops techniques to automate multi-sensor exploitation and information processing that leverage the data fusion, adaptive signal processing, and artificial intelligence \/ machine learning research communities.  This project develops concepts and algorithms for efficient parallel processing, distributed processing, and high-performance computing in sensor data processing and synthetic data generation."

This project also develops and evaluates technology for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensors, fire control radars, electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and offensive information operations systems.  It emphasizes the detection and tracking of surface and airborne targets with radio frequency signatures that are difficult to detect due to reduced radar cross sections, concealment and camouflage measures, severe clutter, or heavy jamming.  Techniques exploited include the use of multiple radio frequency phenomenologies, multi-dimensional adaptive processing, advanced waveforms and knowledge-aided processing techniques. This project also develops concepts to counter threats to our aerospace systems. It develops and evaluates technology for electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and electro-optical\/infrared seeker defeat. This project develops the radio frequency warning and countermeasure technology for advanced electronic warfare and information operations applications. The project also explores technologies to maintain a military advantage in positioning, navigation and timing integrity, accuracy, and resiliency."

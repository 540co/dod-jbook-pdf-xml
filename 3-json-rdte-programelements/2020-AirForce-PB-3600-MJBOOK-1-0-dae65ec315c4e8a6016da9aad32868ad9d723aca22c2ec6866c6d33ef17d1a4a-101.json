The $0.182M FY20 (FY19 PB) to FY20 (FY20 PB) increase is due to 16 fewer authorizations ($2.076M), a budgeted Average Work Year Cost (AWYC) increase ($2.032M) and increased non-civilian pay funding ($0.226M) due to inflation.   The loss of 16 authorizations in this program element is due to multiple incremental workload transitions within the Center. The budgeted AWYC increased approximately $1.179K per authorization due to the FY19 PB not funding the FY20 authorizations to the estimated AWYC."

The acquisition and product support workforce provides cutting edge weapon systems, sustainment capabilities, and is charged with providing management, tools, and technical and business capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs throughout their life cycle.  The direct funded acquisition workforce funded in this program element will support all phases of acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel.  These program elements support both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

Cyber Security threats continue to evolve and it has become more challenging for the Navy to protect systems, detect threats, react to threatens and restore system functionality after a cyber attack.  These evolving threats require specialized training, tool sets and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.  The funding increase supports additional Cyber Security manpower to meet the Program Cyber Security Operational Tests (OT) required by DoD.\n\nThe cyber manpower increase is offset by the realignment of 14 Management Headquarters Activity (MHA) FTE from this program element into 0902498N Management Headquarters (Departmental Support Accounts).\n\n\nTechnical: N\/A\n\nSchedule: N\/A"

This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop \"minimum, adequate\" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems. OT&E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and warfighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources."

The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&S costs for day to day operations of the staff\/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDTEN programs, these funds provide for O&S costs typical of military field commands\/activities). Within this project, over 1\/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead\/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV\/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned\/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&E offices\/activities, and miscellaneous other customers\/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint\/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.                            \n                              \nNumber of Tests Conducted - FY16 = 103; FY17 = 104; FY18 = 108\nNumber of Programs Supported - FY16 = 422; FY17 = 424; FY18 = 424"

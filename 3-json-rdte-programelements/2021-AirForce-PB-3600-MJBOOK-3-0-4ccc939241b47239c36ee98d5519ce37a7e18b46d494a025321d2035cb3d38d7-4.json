The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). \n\nThis program's developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment), and Systems Integration Lab. Additionally, modifications may enhance the aircraft's operations center facilities, to include but not limited to those necessary for the Senior Leadership Command, Control and Communications System (SL3CS), National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC), Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) and other communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Funds may also be used to explore and develop modifications, upgrades, and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements. This budget supports the following developmental modifications and studies\/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment:\n\n- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal\/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal, and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.\n\n- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program replaces the currently installed Very Low Frequency\/Low Frequency (VLF\/LF) Transmit system, which is no longer sustainable after over 35 years of operation. In order to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 requirements and ensure there is assured connectivity between civilian and military leadership and military forces during real world situations, this system must be replaced. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Control\/Monitor group, a Power Amplifier\/Coupler (PA\/C) group, and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.\n\n- The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program upgrades the E-4B's Ultra-High Frequency Radio transmitters to be MUOS capable to meet E-4B Capability Development Document (CDD) and CJCSI 6250.01F requirements.  MUOS provides securable data and full duplex voice communications while simultaneously monitoring a second frequency.  The MUOS upgrade will provide interoperability with MUOS waveforms for voice and data communications and with other nuclear and national C2 centers and aircraft by replacing the legacy USC-42 UHF SATCOM radios with a MUOS capable radio.\n\n- Survivable SHF will upgrade and replace portions of the E-4B's Jam-Resistant Secure Communications (JRSC) system to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 and National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-51\/Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20 requirements and to ensure continued connectivity and interoperability as satellite and communications infrastructure evolves.  Expected modifications include, but are not limited to, component and sub-system upgrades and replacement of portions of the current SHF system that are obsolete or near end of service life. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure, survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).  A risk-reduction study was completed in FY19 to help further define the acquisition strategy of the SSHF modernization program.  The program will be acquired in 2 phases:  Phase 1 will include technical solutions such as upgrading the existing modems, systems integration lab, and Ka-band system.  Phase 2 will include new modem technology, new Ku-band system, common workstation, and upgrades to the X-band system.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-4B weapon system capability; furthermore, it may include support funding for emerging modification requirements to support PMA, A&AS, equipment and other government cost.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-4B weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F or 0605833F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

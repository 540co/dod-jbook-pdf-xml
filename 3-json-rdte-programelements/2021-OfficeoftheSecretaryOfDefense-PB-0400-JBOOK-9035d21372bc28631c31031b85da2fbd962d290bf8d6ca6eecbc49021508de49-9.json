            "val": "This program advances and demonstrates munitions components (warheads, propulsion systems, advanced lethality mechanisms, fuzes and fuze components, etc.) in relevant environments with joint applicability. The goal is to demonstrate joint enabling technologies that increase or improve the lethality, range, reliability, safety, and survivability for existing and future weapons systems. The program invests in research of technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technologies with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts. Increasing the lethality, range and performance of munitions, while striving to increase the safety for our warfighters for munitions in procurement and under development guide program investments. This munitions based Science and Technology (S&T) program focuses on enhancements in weapon speed, range, and lethality while largely utilizing existing advanced insensitive munitions (IM) technology to maximize weapon safety. US power projection capabilities related to near peer competition are lagging and there is an urgent need to provide our warfighters with increased or new capabilities. The program will strive to develop the most lethal weapons possible and communicating associated risks intelligently, so U.S. warfighters can make informed decisions about their weapon systems capabilities and safe handling requirements. IM compliance requirements remain an important aspect of munitions reliability and readiness and thus will remain a critical characteristic of the program. The 2018 National Defense Strategy denotes that \u201cChallenges to the U.S. military advantage represent another shift in the global security environment. For decades the United States has enjoyed uncontested or dominant superiority in every operating domain. Today, every domain is contested\u2014air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.\u201d Therefore, the program will invest in technologies that will enable U.S. warfighters to regain the operational and battlefield advantages that technologies can provide through increased performance, range, and lethality to improve the Joint Force military advantages and build a more lethal force.  This program is has aligned its investment portfolio to complement and utilize priority technology areas (hypersonics, autonomy, artificial intelligence\/machine learning, and microelectronics) defined by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) are established for each technology area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2025, 2030, and 2035 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their weapons system strategic plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plans, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate. The Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) utilize a Technical Advisory Board (TAB) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) technology experts and laboratory representatives, plus senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting."

Mature demonstrated Enhanced Munitions technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing the PEO\u2019s program costs and schedule risk, facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios. Technologies demonstrated seek to improve the performance, lethality, and range of weapons to ensure the U.S. is not outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.\nThe Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (Area Effects Warheads), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (Hard Target Effects Warheads), and 5) Gun Propulsion. Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan. These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs."

Mature demonstrated Enhanced Munitions technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing the PEO\u2019s program costs and schedule risk, facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios. Technologies demonstrated seek to improve the performance, lethality, and range of weapons to ensure the U.S. is not outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.\nThe Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Propulsion - Alternative propulsion designs and systems for increased range, e.g. rotating detonation engines, solid fuel ramjets, highly loaded grain technology, etc.; 2) Minimum Signature Propulsion \u2013 new propellant compositions and hybrid propulsion for reduced time to target\/increased range; 3) Area Effects Warheads \u2013 high performance explosives, reactive materials, multiphase blast, etc.; 4) Hard Target Effects Warheads \u2013 improved penetration for shaped charge jets, lethality enhancements for area effects munitions; and 5) Gun Propulsion \u2013 novel ignition schemes, advanced propellant design, etc. Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri- service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments."

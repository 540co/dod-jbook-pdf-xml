These new ships embark, transport, and land elements of Marine landing forces in an assault by helicopters, landing craft, and amphibious vehicles.  Tactics, techniques, and tools for naval expeditionary warfare continue to evolve.  The LPD 17 Class configuration must continue to adapt to this evolutionary process, because these ships are expected to be in service until almost 2050.  The LPD 17 design includes system configurations that reduce operating and support costs and facilitate operational performance improvements.   System engineering and integration efforts that began in FY97 will develop further reductions in life cycle costs and will integrate performance upgrades in a rapid, affordable manner.

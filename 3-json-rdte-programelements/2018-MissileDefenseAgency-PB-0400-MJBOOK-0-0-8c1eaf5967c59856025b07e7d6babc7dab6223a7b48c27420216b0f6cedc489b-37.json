SBIR and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts."

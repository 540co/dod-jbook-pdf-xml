            "val": "Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  \n\nIt includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commanders'.  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  \n\nThe Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  Project 675135, Warfighter Readiness, includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT) and its follow on program Command & Control Simulation Environment for Training (C2SET), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS). \n\nThe program element also contains Project 674567, M&S Foundations, the Air, Space and Cyberspace Collaborative Environment - Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS).  ACE-IOS is a federation of constructive models for the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is developed and operated by the Air Force Cyber Simulation Center (CSC) to support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises, tests, and experiments. The CSC provides cyber live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environments to support the development and fielding of offensive and defensive cyber capabilities for the AF, DoD, and national agencies.  This program also supports the DoD Training Transformation Initiative.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFMSTT and ACE-IOS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  MSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated\nwith concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsals.\n\nAir, Space and Cyberspace Constructive Environment - Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS) project is a federation of constructive models for the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is developed and operated by the Air Force Cyber Simulation Center (CSC) to support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commands battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises, tests and experiments.  \n\nThe CSC provides cyber live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environments to support the development and fielding of offensive and defensive cyber capabilities for the AF, DoD, and national agencies.  The CSC is managed by the 90th Cyberspace Operations Squadron, a unit of the 318th Cyberspace Operations Group, 67th Cyberspace Wing, 24th Air Force (AFCYBER).  The Distributed Mission Operations Center for Cyberspace (DMOC-C) is a subset of the CSC focused on training and exercising tactical cyber mission forces (CMF) and cyber service providers (CSP) and operational-level command and control, intelligence, and cyber planners and operators.  DMOC-C provides the ACE-IOS to support Air Force information operations.  DMOC-C, using ACE-IOS, directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  DMOC-C thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations covering cyberspace, intelligence and command and control activities as part of the constructive backbone of Air Force capabilities within DOD and coalition LVC environments. \n\nDMOC-C's development and integration efforts on ACE-IOS are imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  LVC environments today are used as one of the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  These efforts enable more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.\n\nAuthorization and Accreditation and Networthiness is maintained via the Information Technology (IT) systems Risk Management Framework (RMF) for seven classified systems and five supported cross domain solutions, which includes code and ruleset development, testing, and fielding, and meets AF Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) and AF Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) net worthiness standards and evaluations.\n\nThis program also supports the DoD Training Transformation Initiative.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFMSTT and ACE-IOS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

Warfighter Readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  \n\nIt includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands.  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  \n\nThe Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  This presently includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT) and its follow on program Command & Control Simulation Environment for Training (C2SET), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS). \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFMSTT and ACE-IOS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

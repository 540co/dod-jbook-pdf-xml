By facilitating the export of U.S. defense systems, the DoD enhances the U.S. defense industrial base, strengthens the military capabilities of U.S. allies around the world, and increases coalition interoperability."

Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. \n\nFailure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace."

            "val": "The DoD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the FY96 National Defense Authorization Act. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP). The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment serves as the OSD Principal Staff Assistant and oversees, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the DoD NLW Executive Agent.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect Joint Service research and development (R&D) investment decisions by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management of the JNLWP for the EA. Research conducted is based on the requirements and capabilities sought by the Services and the Coast Guard, as identified in JROC-approved Joint Non-Lethal Effects Initial Capabilities Documents. This coordinated joint Research and Development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the most relevant non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative Service investment.  Advanced Component Development and Prototypes non-lethal weapons initiatives provide non-lethal capabilities in direct support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objective of strategic competition by providing options to the joint force in pursuit of national objectives in legal or policy constrained scenarios, as well as complementing the use of lethal effects in complex combat scenarios, for example, in urban environments with large civilian populations. Ongoing NLW studies, analyses and exercise efforts with NATO and Allies also support NDS objectives to strengthen alliances and partnerships. Resulting capabilities facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for below lethal threshold engagements.\n\nThis PE funds Joint Service research, development, test, and evaluation of non-lethal weapons, devices, munitions and technologies which provide a non-lethal capability to minimize significant injuries as well as undesired damage to property and the environment. Counter-personnel and counter-materiel capability investment areas include directed energy (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave), multi-sensory suppression\/incapacitation initiatives (acoustics, optical, electro-muscular incapacitation), and other emergent technologies transitioning from coordinated JNLWP Science and Technology PE initiatives.  Investments also focus on Joint and allied experimentation, exercise, demonstration and assessment of advanced component and prototype initiatives in order to assist transition of suitable and effective capabilities to both joint and allied operational applications.\n\nThe Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate is designated as a R&D organization and was established by the EA to manage the day to day research and development activities of the DoD's JNLWP. Each Service is responsible for their procurement and operating support costs."

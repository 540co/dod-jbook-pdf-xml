SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. The SBIRS Next-Gen OPIR will provide improved strategic missile warning coverage and increased resiliency in a strategic constellation to meet the requirements laid out in the Air Force draft Capability Development Document (CDD) based on the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Space Warfighter Construct (SWC) in response to the Space Enterprise Vision (SEV).\n\nThe SBIRS Next Gen OPIR systems includes both space and ground elements. The Next Gen OPIR space segment will consist of Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) satellites, providing real-time persistent global infrared coverage using highly resilient bus with modernized payloads. The space segment will begin development of HEO space vehicles in FY21.  The Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) and Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) are infrastructure modernization efforts to meet guidance laid out in SWC. The FORGE effort will implement an open framework for mission data processing and migration of C2 of satellite operations to integrate with EGS. FORGE and EGS efforts will provide the flexibility to integrate new mission data processing capabilities and more efficiently allow the system to meet evolving warfighter needs."

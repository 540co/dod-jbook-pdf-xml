            "val": "This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment & Program Evaluation (CAPE) by funding assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department\u2019s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, as well as the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department\u2019s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the National Defense Strategy. These RDT&E resources support critical studies and analyses to assist senior DoD leaders in optimally balancing the lethality, partnership, and reform levels of effort to carry out the National Defense Strategy.  \n\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda focuses on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense,  addressing difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.\n\nIn FY 2019 CAPE received increased funding from the DoD Joint Service Provider to support the migration, implementation, and sustainment of its DoD Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) efforts. In addition to the one-year increased RDT&E funding for FY 2019 itemized in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Procurement and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding throughout the FY 2019-2023 FYDP to support the migration and sustainment of these developmental solutions. CAPE's  funds are included in the total Internet DMZ Migration amount transferred from JSP to OSD so that CAPE and three other affected OSD Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs) can execute their own long-term solutions outside of the JSP DMZ.\n\nThe FY 2021 budget proposal includes additional resources to support the Enterprise Visiability and Maintainability of Operation and Support Costs (EVAMOSC). This was a new project in FY 2020. EVAMOSC supports CAPE's responsibility to develop and maintain a database of actual operating and support (O&S) costs for major weapons systems, as required in 10 USC Ch. 137, Sec. 2337a and further refined by Sec. 832 of the 2019 NDAA.  Additionally, the EVAMOSC data capability will directly support development and reporting of readiness metrics associated with implementation of the National Defense Strategy. In FY 2021 CAPE will continue to design and develop an enterprise data platform to serve as the authoritative source of Operating and Support (O&S) cost data for major weapon systems."

The FY 2021 funding increase reflects direction for CAPE to continue work started in FY 2020 to develop and maintain a database of actual operating and support costs for major weapons systems, known as EVAMOSC. In addition to the RDT&E funding for EVAMOSC described in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding in FY 2023, FY 2024, and FY 2025 to support EVAMOSC operational efforts. These funds will enable CAPE to develop and maintain a reference database of actual operating and support (O&S) costs for major weapons systems. Finally the Defense Wide Review realigned RDT&E study funding to provide additional resources directly to CAPE for budget and program assessments."

It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department\u2019s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department\u2019s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda focuses on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance DoD senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development."

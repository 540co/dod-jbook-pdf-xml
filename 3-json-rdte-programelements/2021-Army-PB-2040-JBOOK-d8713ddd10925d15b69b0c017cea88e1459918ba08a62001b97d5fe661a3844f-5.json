            "val": "The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the materiel solution for replacement of the Army's Armored Personnel Carrier (M113) Family of Vehicles (FoV) within the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). It will mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability across the Spectrum of Conflict. The AMPV will replace five mission roles currently performed by the M113 FoV by transferring the current M113 Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) to a new Military Vehicle Derivative (MVD) platform. In total, the AMPV FoV will account for approximately 30% of the ABCT's tracked fleet and consists of the following five variants:\n1. Mission Command (MCmd) Vehicle: This platform enables effective mission command planning and execution for both the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and Tactical Command (TAC) Vehicle versions of the MCmd. It will host current Battle Command Systems, future replacements, and upgrades of hardware and software.\n2. Medical Treatment (MT) Vehicle: This platform will provide a protected surgical environment, with adequate lighting and accessible medical equipment. It will provide a capability for immediate medical care for one patient by a medical crew of four.\n3. Medical Evacuation (ME) Vehicle: This platform will conduct ambulance type activities and provide casualty evacuation for up to four litters or six ambulatory patients, with a crew of three medical attendants.\n4. General Purpose (GP) Vehicle: This platform will operate throughout the battle space by conducting re-supply, maintenance, casualty evacuation, and other tasks within the formation.\n5. Mortar Carrier (MC) Vehicle: This platform will provide immediate responsive fire support to conduct fast-paced offensive operations.\n\nThe AMPV program was initiated with a Capability Development Document (CDD) that was approved on 21 June 2013 and subsequently revised on 24 October 2016. The CDD reflects a set of stable, technologically achievable requirements. A Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was held on 9 December 2014 and it was followed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) that was signed on 22 December 2014. The ADM approved MS B for the AMPV program and entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. In addition, the ADM authorized the Army to proceed with award of the EMD prime contract, which occurred on 23 December 2014 to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, L.P. (BAE). A subsequent ADM was issued on 26 September 2017 and it approved: a revised acquisition documentation tailoring plan, revised Milestone C entrance criteria, and an increase in the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity to 551 vehicles (to recognize the Army's desire for early fielding of AMPVs for the European Deterrence Initiative). An ADM was then issued on 1 November 2017 and it delegated Milestone Decision Authority to the Secretary of the Army and re-designated AMPV as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC program. An Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) was held on December 20, 2018 with the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) and the Vice Chief of Staff Army (VCSA) approving the program to enter LRIP. The program received its LRIP ADM on January 25, 2019.\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 planned program primarily consists of efforts associated with Production Qualification Testing (PQT), Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E), and the Production and Deployment phase Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E). Prime contractor support will be required for testing and engineering to ensure adequate system support packages will be available during the tests. Government test locations will be used for the tests and government personnel will be responsible for the overall management of the efforts.  This program supports the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) Cross Functional Team (CFT)."

The contractor provided support of EMD testing activities at government test locations; including Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) testing at the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), system live fire testing of prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), and Limited User Testing (LUT) at a location to be determined. All testing activities were completed by the end of 1QFY2019. As required, the contractor analyzed the results of the testing program and incorporated any necessary design changes into selected prototypes. In addition to test support, the contractor completed a System Verification Review \/ Production Readiness Review (SVR\/PRR) 1QFY2019. The SVR\/PRR is a formal examination of the program to ensure that the AMPV design is ready for production and that the contractor has accomplished adequate production planning. As part of the AMPV design assessment, the contractor evaluates the capabilities of the AMPV design to satisfy other emerging Army requirements. Based on all engineering design work completed under the EMD contract, the contractor will also complete and deliver a final Technical Data Package (TDP). A final significant area of effort for the prime contractor during the EMD contract is continued work related to Logistics Support. This includes completion of the Logistics Demonstration, completion of the entire Technical Manual validation, and the start of Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) verification. In support of Milestone C, the contractor will support an update to the Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP), completion of the Product Support Business Case Analysis, completion of the Depots Source of Repair (DSOR) Analysis, completion of the Core Depot Assessment (CDA), and completion of the Item Unique Identification (IUID) Plan. Following completion of Milestone C (completed 1QFY2019), the program exercised the existing option for the first year of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP-1). Under the LRIP-1 contract option, the prime contractor provides support to planned Production Qualification Testing (PQT) and, therefore, this element also includes costs related to PQT support. FY2019 prime contractor efforts included support to PQT planning and the identification\/procurement of System Support Packages (SSPs) that are required for PQT. In support of PQT, the Government procured selected mission equipment for the PQT test articles."

PQT is scheduled to begin 4QFY2020 and complete in 4QFY2021, with the exception of natural environmental testing that will continue into 3QFY2022.  LFT&E will begin in 1QFY2021 and end in 4QFY2021. Currently, a total of 25 vehicles will undergo PQT. As part of PQT, and in support of RAM assessments, six vehicles will run a total of 14,000 miles. The miles will be equally split between the ATC and the YTC. An additional 19 vehicles will undergo performance testing as part of PQT. This testing will be performed at ATC, YTC, WSMR, EPG, CRTC, TRTC, and DPG. PQT is conducted with production-representative vehicles from LRIP. The objectives include verification that the production-representative systems meet performance requirements, generation of data to support the system evaluation in support of the FRP decision, and determination of system readiness to enter IOT. Government costs include all costs incurred at the test sites and costs associated with Government personnel that will be collecting\/analyzing test data, as well as personnel associated with providing oversight of the activities. The LFT&E will yield information to complement earlier vulnerability tests and modeling and analysis efforts. It will also be used to fill data voids from prior testing and will validate ballistic and blast performance at the system level to completely evaluate vehicle, crew, and occupant survivability. Ten vehicles will undergo testing at ATC. There are three elements to the testing: CDE, FUSL testing. CDE will be conducted on selected subsystems integrated into the AMPV to determine the consequences of various types of damage. This information will be used to confirm the impact of subsystem damage on platform functionality. Fire Survivability Testing will generate the data required to evaluate the effectiveness of the AFES. Its purpose is to protect crews and internal, stowed equipment from fires expected to be initiated by ballistic impacts. FUSL testing will demonstrate the ballistic resiliency and crew survivability of fully functional, production-representative, combat-loaded AMPV variants and investigate the synergistic effects of various damage mechanisms and failure modes. 30 AMPV LRIP vehicles will participate in the IOT&E, with an additional 6 AMPV LRIP vehicles located at the test location to serve as back-up vehicles. The IOT&E events will be conducted under realistic operational conditions using Army units executing decisive action operations IAW U.S. Army doctrine against a representative OPFOR. The test events are designed to produce data to satisfy the evaluation requirements in order to assess the operational effectiveness and suitability of the system under test. The AMPV IOT&E is scheduled to be conducted 4QFY2021-1QFY2022. The location of the IOT will be determined by the Army TSARC based on availability of units and maneuver area (At this time the location is assumed to be Ft. Stewart, GA). PM AMPV will plan and coordinate any follow-on developmental and\/or operational testing that will be required due to configuration changes during production, or verification that any post production deficiencies in materiel, training, or concepts have been satisfactorily corrected. PM AMPV will support Instructor and Key Personnel Training (I&KPT), OPNET, and FLMNET. PM AMPV will provide a NMIB to the IOT unit prior to OPNET, and finalize with the unit the target audience for New Equipment Training."

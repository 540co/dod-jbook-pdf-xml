Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.\n\n    The Cyber Security project is developing the computing, networking, and cyber security technologies required to protect DoD, U.S. government, and U.S. civilian information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems. Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. industry.\n\n   The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.  Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act."

The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems.  Advances in these areas could allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations.  Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, should help develop new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications."

SC2 will address the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access.  Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack.  First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized.  Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack.  SC2 will address this challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time.  In particular, SC2 participants will be challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies.  SC2 will conduct two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years.  The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum."

We currently lack both the algorithms and computational power to manage the volume of data and complexity of decision-making that will be required.

Because of these limitations the amount of information gathered is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in computational efficiency to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.  Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlespace in real time.  The HIVE program moves to PE 0602716E\/ Project ELT-02 in FY 2019."

At present, enterprises and Internet-based information technology service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers, which brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing.  The Dispersed Computing program will develop a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources.  A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements.  These dual-purposed network-compute elements make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks\/chokepoints and to mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data given network conditions and available network-compute elements.  With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so."

The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering.  The CASE technical approach formulates cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering.  CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber physical systems.  If successful, CASE technologies will enable the design of cyber physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries."

These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls: attackers will assimilate poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets.

To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems. The SSITH program moves to Project ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technology, in FY 2019."

Authenticating parts or detecting counterfeit components by current means has proven expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness.

SHIELD instead sought to incorporate a small, inexpensive silicon chip (\"dielet\") into the packaging of genuine components.  The dielet provided unique and encrypted component identification, enabling authentication from very close proximity.  Since counterfeit electronic components pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of both commercial and DoD systems, SHIELD fulfilled a large, pressing, and evolving need for anti-counterfeit technologies."

If current trends continue, future U.S. military autonomous systems will need to perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions, and AI will be critical to such systems. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust.  Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, or not meaningful to a human user.  XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models meaningful to end-users.  XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation autonomous, data analytics, and decision-support systems."

At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, resulting in only one interpretation with alternatives being eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence.  AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from multiple sources into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends.  If successful, AIDA will provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly."

Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets.  As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand.  LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources.  These capabilities will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance\/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response."

Performing this mapping is difficult even when design documentation for the source is available, and so it represents a significant barrier to data interoperability and knowledge acquisition.  AKA will leverage advances in semantic technology and machine learning to enable machines to perform the entire data integration function without human intervention.  AKA technology will automatically learn the semantics of a new data source, characterize source content, align source schema to the target, transform and load values, and reconcile inconsistencies by learning from previously integrated sources.  AKA technologies will automatically create and maintain, in real-time, broad knowledge of local and regional military, political, economic, social, and cultural information for warfighters in theater."

In particular, this program is focused on improving DoD processes that, because of the need for excessive human involvement, create bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities.  If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly reduce the time and cost associated with many important developmental, approval and certification processes.  One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to minimal human intervention.  Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems.  Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models.  AAI application areas include the following:  (1) machine-enabled techniques to reduce human engagement in determining trustworthiness and intent; (2) automated approaches for accreditation of military software systems; and (3) technologies to restore movement and sensation to central nervous system impaired patients."

For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human society.  Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security.  Many important events are not simple occurrences but complex phenomena that are composed of numerous subsidiary event elements, some of which happen simultaneously while others are sequential and dependent on each other.  Humans make sense of event sequences by organizing them into narrative structures that may occur or re-occur frequently.  These structures are abstracted into schemas - organized units of knowledge that represent patterns - for the purpose of cognition. The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that use existing schemas and, when needed, create new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators. Given multi-media inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events. KAIROS technologies will enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately."

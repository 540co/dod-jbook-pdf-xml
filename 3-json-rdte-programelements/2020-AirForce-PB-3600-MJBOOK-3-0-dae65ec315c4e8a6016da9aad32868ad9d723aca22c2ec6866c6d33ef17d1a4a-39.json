Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment, sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during air\/land operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.\n\nC-17 Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) funding efforts support, but are not limited to:  Aircraft performance improvements, aircraft mission execution and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications\/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering\/program management administration support; support for avionics laboratories; software development, test and integration; block development\/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering\/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-17 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nIn FY20 the efforts are:  Roll-On Conference Capsule (ROCC)and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) which will be covered in more detail on subsequent pages.\n\nThis funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform-related rapid capability development process activities including early planning, analysis and systems engineering activities which provide linkages between operational needs, system performance requirements, technology needs and opportunities, potential lifecycle costs and enabling the technical foundation for material development.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

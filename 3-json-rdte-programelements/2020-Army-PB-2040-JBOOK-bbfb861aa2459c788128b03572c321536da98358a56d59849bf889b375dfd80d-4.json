This PE executes the Army's Combat Vehicle Prototyping program to mature, integrate and demonstrate ground vehicle leap ahead technologies in support of future combat vehicles. Project 221 (Combat Vehicle Survivability) matures, integrates and demonstrates protection and survivability technologies such as active protection systems, advanced vehicle armors, blast mitigation and occupant safety devices to address both current and emerging advanced threats to ground vehicles. Project 441 (Combat Vehicle Mobility) matures and demonstrates advanced ground vehicle power and mobility technologies such as powertrains, power generation and storage, water and fuel logistics, and running gear subsystems for military ground vehicles to enable a more efficient, mobile and deployable force. Project 497 (Combat Vehicle Electro) matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware (computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command\/control\/driving mechanisms) and software that result in increased crew efficiencies, vehicle performance, reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) burdens and vehicle maintenance costs. Project 515 (Robotic Ground Systems) matures and demonstrates unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) technologies with a focus on sensors, perception hardware and software, and robotic control algorithms that enable UGV systems to maneuver on and off road at speeds which meet mission requirements with minimal human intervention.\n\nIn FY 2018\/FY 2019, work in this PE is coordinated with, PE 0602105A (Materials), 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability, Robotics Technology), 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), 0602784 (Military Engineering Technology), 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), 0603005 (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology), 0603734 (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), 0604115A (Technology Maturation Initiatives), and 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).  \n\nBeginning in FY 2020, work in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology), PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology), and 0603119A (Ground Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command."

This effort leverages lessons learned from prior and ongoing individual component efforts within industry, academia and Department of Defense (DoD). This effort is done in coordination with efforts in PEs 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), and 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology)."

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces.\nOvercoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities."

Mature technologies are incorporated onto existing, Army owned UGV technology demonstrators so that performance of the enabling technologies can be evaluated.\n\nThe approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office. Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio. Ground Maneuver Portfolio investments are greatly improving logistics throughput and surge capability supporting maneuver forces (Leader Follower technology) and allow experimentation with manned and unmanned teams to develop the advantages that inform\/protect the maneuver force (Robotic Wingman JCTD).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities."

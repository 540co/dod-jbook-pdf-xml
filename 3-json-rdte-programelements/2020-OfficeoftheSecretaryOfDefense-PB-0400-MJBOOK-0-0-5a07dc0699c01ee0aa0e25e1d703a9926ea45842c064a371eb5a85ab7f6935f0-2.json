The program is authorized by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2362 and is funded by annual appropriations.  This competitive program provides support through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts for research, education assistance, and instrumentation purchases.\n\nWork in this PE provides a foundation to enhance participation of HBCUs\/MIs in DoD research, including infrastructure; strengthen research and educational opportunities at HBCUs\/MIs and increase the number of minority graduates in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines important to the national defense; and build a more diverse pool of scientists and engineers to meet future workforce needs.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Services\u2019 Research Offices and DoD Laboratories (includes the Army Research Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory) for Centers of Excellence (COE).  Centers currently funded through cooperative agreements include COEs in Autonomy, Cyber Security, Research Data Analysis, and STEM Scholars."

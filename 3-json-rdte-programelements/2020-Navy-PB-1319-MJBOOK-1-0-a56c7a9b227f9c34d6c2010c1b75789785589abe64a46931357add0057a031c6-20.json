ATA expands the automated test methods currently in use such as Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT), adds new methods of testing and use of automated test technologies, and standardizes automated test practices, methods and tools. Examples from FY16 include but are not limited to improvements to Link-16 Non-C2 data collection, essential Mission Planning, Service Oriented Architecture Framework, AEGIS Enterprise Solution Enhancements, Strike Force Interoperability testing and Control System Restoration and Validation. In addition, funding supports the development of enterprise level strategies to apply ATA technology to the software-intensive acquisition programs. The FY 2015 ATRT project was funded on Program Element 0603597N: \"Automated Test and Re-Test\". Starting in FY16 and through the out-years, the project is renamed \"Automated Test and Analysis\" on Program Element 0603597N."

Proposals selected by the ESG will typically be funded for one year, in which time they must demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce the time to complete critical testing, improve and speed test analysis, or find and correct critical design flaws in testing of Naval acquisition programs. Successful funded proposals and artifacts will be advertised and made available across the Naval enterprise for acquisition program consideration, funding, and use."

ATA expands the automated test methods currently in use such as Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT), adds new methods of testing and use of automated test technologies, and standardizes automated test practices, methods and tools. Examples from FY16 include but are not limited to improvements to Link-16 Non-C2 data collection, essential Mission Planning, Service Oriented Architecture Framework, AEGIS Enterprise Solution Enhancements, Strike Force Interoperability testing and Control System Restoration and Validation. In addition, funding supports the development of enterprise level strategies to apply ATA technology to the software-intensive acquisition programs. The FY 2015 ATRT project was funded on Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88: \"Automated Test and Re-Test\". Starting in FY16 and through the out-years, the project is renamed \"Automated Test and Analysis\" on Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88."

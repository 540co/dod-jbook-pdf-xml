The first project area develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for electro-optical sensors, radar sensors and electronic counter-countermeasures, and components and algorithms. The second project area develops and demonstrates radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) sensors for detecting, locating, and targeting airborne, fixed, and time-critical mobile ground targets obscured by natural or man-made means. Together, the projects in this program develop the means to find, fix, target, track, and engage air and ground targets anytime, anywhere, and in any weather. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

This includes developing and demonstrating integrated and cooperative fire control techniques to provide for adverse-weather precision air strikes against multiple targets per pass and at maximum weapon launch ranges.  Specific fire control technologies under development include attack management, sensor fusion, automated decision aids, advanced tracking for low radar cross section threats, and targeting using both on-board and off-board sensor information.  This project area also evaluates targeting techniques to support theater missile defense efforts in surveillance and attack.  These fire control technologies will provide force multiplication and reduce warfighter exposure to hostile fire.  This project area also develops and demonstrates target identification and recognition technologies for positive, high confidence cueing, recognition, and identification of airborne and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets at longer ranges than are currently possible.  The goal is to apply these technologies to tactical air-to-air and air-to-surface weapon systems so they are able to operate in all weather conditions, during day or night, and in high-threat, multiple target environments.  Model-based vision algorithms and target signature development techniques are the key to target identification and recognition.  This project is maturing these technologies in partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and evaluating the techniques to support theater missile defense efforts in surveillance and attack.  Fire control and recognition technologies developed and demonstrated in this project area are high leverage efforts, providing for significant advancements in operational capabilities largely through software improvements readily transitionable to new and existing weapon systems."

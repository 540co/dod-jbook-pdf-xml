Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.  \n\nThe Basic Research Initiatives program element (PE) supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative, and the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship Program (Vannevar Bush), formerly known as the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program."

This plan defines actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of producing high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for the Department. SSBR initiatives support the five Basic Research Office strategic goals:  (1) drive the direction of DoD basic research investments; (2) coordinate and conduct oversight of DoD basic research programs; (3) improve science and engineering (S&E) workforce and public outreach; (4) enhance university-industry collaboration; and (5) engage with academic research community and international partners. \n\nThe Minerva Research Initiative, a department-wide basic research program in the social sciences directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, seeks to build a fundamental understanding of the sources of present and future conflict.  It is one of the Nation\u2019s only social science basic research programs in support of national security (especially funding field research).  Minerva promotes a deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radicalization and regional instabilities develop, and supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally, and are updated annually according to inputs from across the defense enterprise."

There were 16 collaborative research projects conducted between DoD researchers and Vannevar Bush Fellows in areas of scientific or technological importance to DoD, while also expanding the research capabilities of DoD laboratories.  Additionally, the I-Corps Pilot Program aimed at accelerating commercialization of basic research innovations was successfully launched, with one team selected for support, and five additional teams in the queue.  Modeled after the National Science Foundation's I-Corps program, the DoD program facilitates collaboration between academia and industry to spur the transition of defense innovations of interest into emerging products and services.  Those emerging products and services have the potential for commercialization into industry or transition into DoD programs of record."

All components contribute to Minerva goals of revitalizing connections between DoD and academic social science communities and building cultural and foreign area knowledge on topics ranging from the mechanisms of radicalization to geopolitical power projection strategies in a multipolar world.  This deeper scientific understanding will provide a more informed basis to shape doctrine, analysis, and other strategic and operational decisions made by war planners and warfighters."

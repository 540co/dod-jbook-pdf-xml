In addition, the PE enables concept exploration efforts and studies of alternative concepts.  The research projects are aligned with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priorities and designated focus areas that include non-system specific technology efforts and feasibility assessments and are formulated and managed by teams of subject matter experts drawn from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Services, and the Defense Agencies.

The proposed work intends to achieve new, cheaper, high-yield, production routes to CL-20.\n- Research CL-20 production with fewer organic synthesis reactions, thereby reducing production costs; these reactions will employ commercially available metal catalysts, instead of the current expensive Palladium catalyst required.\n- Pursue the CL-20 precursor known as TetraAcetylDiAminohexaazaisowurtzitane (TADA), utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) starting materials.\n- Work on small-scale mixing of CL-20 propellant formulations to achieve reasonable viscosity, pot life, mechanical and safety properties.\n\nDevelopment of Prototype Soft Epidermal Biosystems with Advanced Sensing Capabilities for Warfighters in Triage Settings: To develop a wireless epidermal system that integrates flexible electronics and a range of biosensors to provide rapid vital sign screening solution for battlefield triage of combat casualties. \n- Development of stretchable circuit and biosensor designs.\n- Integration of soft elastomeric substrates and fluidic channel.\n- Validation of porcine animal model and test conditions for future evaluation of novel epidermal biosystems.\n- Evaluation of epidermal biosystems in porcine animal models and clinical settings."

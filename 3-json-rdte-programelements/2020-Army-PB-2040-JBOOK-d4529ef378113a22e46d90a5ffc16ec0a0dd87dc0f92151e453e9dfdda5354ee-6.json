Further detail provided in R2A.     \n\nProject 323, the Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 Network Enabling Functions. CHS is a designated Army Strategic Source that acquires and sustains highly flexible, cost effective, and simplified non developmental C4ISR solutions that integrates the latest and emerging commercial technology onto the Converged Mission Command Network. \n\nCHS provides technical support, environmental and survivability testing, system design, end of life\/configuration management, and strengthens cyber security\/supply chain risk management across Army tactical programs to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the computing infrastructure. CHS continuously analyzes and tracks hardware from cradle-to-grave, from emerging technology until end-of-life. CHS conducts hardware evaluations that facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across numerous Army programs and agencies including: Mission Command; Tactical Network; Tactical Radios; Distributed Common Ground Station Army; Aviation Systems; Counter Rocket, Artillery, Mortar; Communication Electronics Command; Communications Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Command, among others. CHS rapidly procures common hardware configurations across the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), Common Operating Environment (COE), the sustainment community, and tactical programs that enables the continuous modernization in support of all four Network Modernization Lines of Effort and future Network CFT experimentation. CHS logistical services include worldwide 72 hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, tailorable supply chain and cybersecurity measures, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements. CHS supports better buying power initiatives by creating efficiencies through economies of scale, price breaks, streamlined processes, reduced cycle times, and centralized contracting.\n \nProject 334, the Common Software (CS) program, is the suite of systems through which the Army develops, integrates and tests common software products and\/or components used for communication between Army Mission Command Systems and Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Mission Command (MC) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort. The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems. The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's COE modernization efforts. There is no FY20 RDTE funding since Common SW will be transitioning into sustainment in FY19.\n \nProject C29, the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF), is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of system verification\/validation checkout, testing, and configuration management for the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. The Centralized Technical Support Facility (CTSF) funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort LOE 1B Network Enabling Functions.\n\nProject C34 supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. The Army Tac C2 Sys Eng project funds the PEO Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Technical Management Division (TMD), which effectively manages the System-of-Systems engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts for the continuing evolution of the network within the PEO C3T portfolio of technology across the capability enhancement packages to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solutions.  \n\nProject EJ4, the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), is one of the computing environments under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative, a major Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort of the Network Cross-Functional Team (N-CFT). CPCE provides a common software infrastructure framework (common interface, data, and services) upon which future Warfighter capabilities can be built. CPCE development efforts initially target Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA) capability development at tactical echelons that span from Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to Battalion level. The CPCE will be the central computing environment developed to support command posts and combat operations, and will be interoperable with Mounted and Mobile\/Handheld systems.\n\nProject EJ5, the Mounted Computing Environment (MCE), is one of the six computing environments (CEs) formalized by the AAE under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative. MCE standardizes end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications while leveraging existing hardware under the Joint Battle Command - Platform program. Requirements for the MCE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the draft Mounted Computing Environment Requirements Definition Package (RDP 1). FY20 funding provides the means to continue to manage and develop MCE in concert with the Army's future COE strategy.\n\nProject EJ6, Tactical Enhancement supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Sight and beyond line of sight radio systems. In addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current WIN-T SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti- jam capability and resiliency to WIN-T Program of Record satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on WIN-T satellite modems.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY28\/29). The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events. \n .\nProject EK9, Unified Network Operations (UNO) will deliver an integrated Network Operations (NetOps) capability, based upon an open framework, aggregating data, which enables common planning, configuration, management, monitoring, and defense of the Network. This will be accomplished through the integration, co-hosting, and federation of multiple NetOps systems from the hand held devices to the Enterprise. UNO aligns with the Army's intent to develop NetOps prototypes, conduct development operations (DevOps), get user feedback, make adjustments and ultimately deliver enhanced capabilities to the operational force in the shortest time possible using what is available in industry or through other government agencies through an adapt and buy approach based on experimentation and demonstration.\n\nProject ER9, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2), fields mobile Command Post Nodes by integrating supporting mission command solutions in accordance with Directed Requirement with a FY20 First Unit Equipped in order to enhance the survivability and mobility of brigade and below command post formations. On order, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure will replace selected elements of the legacy command post to provide improved expeditionary capability, survivability, agility, and scalability for Corps and Division Main and Tactical Command Posts, Brigade Main and Tactical Command Posts, and Battalion Command Posts. It will ensure information and support systems are introduced into the Command Post through physical integration allowing the commander to tailor the Command Post as missions dictate.\n\nProject EQ8, Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment, supports the Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program.  The program leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations.  The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader.  \n\nProject EW3, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR),supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. UTR is the process performed by the S6 and their staff to affect change on the network in order to support the operational mission and dynamic nature of the Army.  Currently network challenges exist during this process with regard to:  maintaining accurate and up to date information,  distributing configuration files and activating \/ re-establishing the network.  UTR strives to make authoritative NETOPS Data available across all systems, reduce cognitive burden for soldiers to plan and manage the network and reduce manual touch labor."

The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the C4ISR systems, and a core communication component of the virtualized infrastructure and will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command (PM MC) General Services Administration (GSA) engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on a single development solicitation. This strategy is designed to optimize opportunities for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition, and to ensure the rapid integration of new capabilities into warfighter systems. This strategy is also designed to reduce the physical footprint, the logistics support requirements, and to increase operational efficiency by integration of additional system interoperability services which reduce duplication of effort and cost; and allows for development of communication standards across the DoD community."

The CTSF accomplishes this through the enforcement of a standards based architecture while supporting the development and implementation of an integrated computing infrastructure and a converged network.  The CTSF functions as the CIO\/G6's designated independent test agent and Land\/WarNet\/Mission Command (LWN\/MC) configuration manager. The CTSF provides validated test data to the Department of the Army and Joint agencies to accredit interoperability certifications. The distributed test environment of the CTSF is accomplished through the Federation of Net-centric Sites (FaNS) construct. This FaNS construct addresses distributed integration development and testing using the core infrastructure of the CTSF to harness Army and Joint expertise\/resources. Through these federated resources, the CTSF executes or supports interoperability development, integration and certification testing of the systems and system of systems in the Warfighter Mission Area, to include Network Evaluation spinouts, as they become part of the Army's LandWarNet. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan."

This software infrastructure will be central to the COE, allowing interoperability between command posts, mounted platforms, and dismounted handheld devices while supporting collaboration using a common picture with Joint and Unified Action partners. CPCE will provide a core software infrastructure including a common operating picture (COP) tool, common look and feel (user interface), common data strategy, interoperable tactical messaging\/chat, and essential movement and maneuver capabilities. CPCE software infrastructure and applications will reside on Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) hardware and previously fielded BCCS\/TSI servers. The CPCE eliminates \"stove-piped\" legacy systems, duplicative or redundant implementations, simplifies future application development efforts, and enhances interoperability and data sharing across multiple echelons.  Acquisition Goals of the CPCE include: Acquisition Agility, Open System Architectures, Reduced Life Cycle Costs, and a Cyber-Hardened Foundation for applications and services.\n\nThe initial version of CPCE completed Initial Operational Test and Evaluation at NIE 18.2 in November 2018, a Fielding \/ Software Deployment decision is targeted for 2QFY19 along with entering the acquisition life cycle.  The new program of record will be comprised of the tactical server infrastructure, Mission Command software infrastructure, and movement\/maneuver Warfighting function applications.  First Unit Equipped in 4QFY19.\n\nRequirements for the CPCE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the CPCE Requirements Definition Package (RDP)."

The JBC-P program provides the hardware and network, while JBC-P software will be replaced with MCE. Future development will continue to leverage JBC-P hardware and MCE software and integrate multiple warfighting systems into the platform (mounted) environment.\n\nMCE is being developed over time, with the initial set of v3 Minimum Essential Capabilities (MECs) being delivered in 4QFY19. Subsequent deliveries of capabilities are expected on a 5 year cycle, in accordance with the AROC approved COE IS ICD. This cycle may be adjusted depending on many factors, including fielding priorities, effectiveness of backwards compatibility, and time required to develop and test new capabilities.\n\nTo accomplish the goals of the MCE, PEO C3T PM MC architects, designs, and develops the hardware, software, network solutions and capabilities required to achieve compliance with the COE. Primary systems architecture engineering is conducted by in-house Government engineering staff with contracted support, matrix elements and MITRE Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center. Test and Evaluation support is provided by in-house PM MC TMD staff, with support from contractor firms, for preparation and conduct of specific risk reduction events and test events. Developmental testing is being conducted by the software development teams with Government oversight and coordination. IOT&E efforts will be supported by the ATEC community. Hardware to support system architecture and software development is comprised of standardized equipment and is procured using existing contract vehicles such as Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS)."

TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Sight and beyond line of sight radio systems. \n\nIn addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current WIN-T SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti- jam capability and resiliency to WIN-T Program of Record satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on WIN-T satellite modems.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY28\/29). The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events. \n\nSIGMOD Capabilities: \nTRILOS: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS).  TRILOS will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) radio verses the aging HCLOS system. \nTROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System.  TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth.\n\nFY20 funds support NCW-R developmental testing effort to add a projected satellite communication capability to tactical network"

This will be accomplished through the integration, co-hosting, and federation of multiple NetOps systems from the hand held devices to the Enterprise. UNO aligns with the Army's intent to develop NetOps prototypes, conduct DevOps, get user feedback, make adjustments and ultimately deliver enhanced capabilities to the operational force in the shortest time possible using what is available in industry or through other government agencies through an adapt and buy approach based on experimentation and demonstration.\n\nFY20 funding will continue support of MTA (Mid-Tier Acquisition) (Section 804) rapid prototyping efforts of UNO v1.0 via capabilities that will be expanded upon based on Network CFT initiatives and directed requirements. UNO v1.0 will be comprised of Network Management, Integrated Planner, Radio Planner, and Federated Data Repository capabilities that utilize the try, buy, decide strategy put forth by Army leadership.

The Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment (M\/HH CE) is one of the six computing environments under the COE, which provides the standards for all Army hand held applications enabling the use of common End User Devices by Soldiers, thereby eliminating redundant devices and reducing the Soldiers' load.\n\nThe M\/HH CE supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 (Unified Network) and LOE 2 (Common Operating Environment) by utilizing (1) interoperable data, message, and waveforms, (2) sensors and applications that enable operations across domains and (3) integration with Joint C4ISR and strike capabilities. Nett Warrior (NW) complies with the technical standards documented by the M\/HH CE and provides the dismounted common computational platform for other products relevant to dismounted Soldiers. Through compliance with the M\/HH CE, software applications from other programs are integrated with the NW system, reducing the need for duplicate hardware and resulting in reduced Soldier Load. NW leverages commercial smart phone devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness for use during combat operations. NW applied feedback from conventional and Special Operations units to procure and implement Secure but Unclassified (SBU) networking equipment for Security Force Assistance Brigades to enable faster, more flexible Mission Command data exchanges with Joint and Coalition forces while maintaining the existing integrated mission command capability with Joint Battle Command Platform systems. NW uses Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Non Developmental (NDI) communications equipment to create a robust and flexible SBU network that enables faster and more accurate decision making in fights at the tactical level.\n\nRequirements for the M\/HH CE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the draft M\/HH CE Requirements Definition Package (RDP)."

Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures.  The Nett Warrior (NW) program provides situational awareness and mission command to dismounted combat leaders through a secure commercial smart device, power source, cables and the Integrated Tactical Network.  NW funds development and evaluation of new technology and software integration through a combination of competitively awarded contracts.  Various existing follow on procurement contracts are utilized to procure a combination of COTs and GOTs NW equipment to include supporting services.  NW program completed LRIP\/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&E under DOT&E oversight in 4QFY14- 1QFY15. This IOT&E event led to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision in FY17. Now in production, NW aggressively seeks operational feedback and, using the DevOps process, identifies and implements capability improvements."

This Line of Effort (LOE) will focus on developing and obtaining approval of requirements for integrated command posts, then delivering these integrated command post designs to Army units.\n\nThe CPI2 program addresses the requirements for more mobile, scalable, interoperable, and agile command posts. Current stationary command posts are deemed too large and take too long to setup and teardown making them vulnerable to near peer detection and targeting technologies. By integrating mission command warfighting functions on to formation appropriate vehicle platforms, a dispersed command post construct will enable the battle staff to blend in with the overall maneuver formation while giving the commander the ability to synchronize the close fight on the move. This dispersed mobile command post consists of Mission Command Platforms (MCPs) and Command Post Support Vehicles (CPSVs). The MCP is a formation appropriate vehicle that provides digital workstations for all mission command warfighting functions. The CPSV is the hub of the dispersed command post; it hosts mission command servers, radios, local area network components and a secure wireless capability.\n\nThe CPI2 Materiel Development Decision Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed on 21 June 2018 and directs CPI2 to be executed in a two increment approach. Increment 1 will develop capabilities to address needs identified in the signed Command Post (CP) Directed Requirement (DR) while Increment 2 will execute requirements as identified in the emerging CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD).  Using the buy, try, assess, and decide improved acquisition model which leverages user experimentation to inform follow on program requirements, Increment 1 will prototype and integrate available commercial off the shelf and government programs of record (PORs) that provide mission command and communications functions within the command post. Subsequently, CPI2 will initiate Increment 2 based on an emerging CDD to replace legacy command post systems at Corps, Division, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) and their subordinate Battalion formations.\n\nFY20 funding provides for the design engineering, prototype manufacturing, and integration efforts for BCTs, with a government solution for First Unit Equipped and an industry solution for the following BCTs. FY20 funding also delivers an experimental Mobile Command Group formation to 1 Corps\/Division.  Funding includes obtaining the required MCP\/CPSV vehicle platforms and Command Post infrastructure systems. In FY20, CPI2 will conduct several training and test events that will provide user assessments on all experimental solutions to inform future design updates and program requirements."

Additionally, CPI2 will leverage industry advancements and innovation using full and open competition with the C5SIR Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to design and prototype the MCP\/CPSV for the second BCT set.  Finally, CPI2 will deliver an experimental Mobile Command Group formation to 1 Corps\/Division. FY20 will culminate with test events on all prototype designs, leading to a Milestone C in FY21 to select the Command Post (CP) solution set for fielding the remaining 3 BCTs and 1 Corps\/Division identified in the CP DR.\n\nThe CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD) is projected to re-enter JCIDS staffing in FY19, which will specify the requirements for the CPI2 Increment 2. Increment 2 will execute a competitive contract award planned based on Request For Proposal (RFP) responses and source selection process. This contract is projected to be a 5 year Firm Fixed Priced\/Cost Plus Fixed Fee (FFP\/CPFF) contract for the design, engineering, prototyping, Developmental Test (DT), New Equipment Training (NET), one Limited User Test (LUT), and one Operational Test (OT) which will encompass CPI2 variants at Corps, Division, and Brigade and Battalion echelons with Option Years for production.\n\nWhere needed, CPI2 will leverage existing contracts managed by Project Manager (PM) Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Project Manager (PM) Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and Project Manager (PM) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) for integration efforts associated with their respective platforms."

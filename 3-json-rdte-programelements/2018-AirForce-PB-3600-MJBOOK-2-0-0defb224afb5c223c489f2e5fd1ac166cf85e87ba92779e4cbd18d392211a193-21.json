The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed on specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.\n\nIn FY17, MQ-9 Upgrade, was a new start.\n\nIn FY18 the MQ-9 Reaper system has three separate development programs. This PE includes:\n\n1. MQ-9 Development and Fielding. This effort is for development and fielding of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft and GCSs and associated communications systems, sensors, payloads, simulators and support equipment.\n\n2. Squadron Operations Centers (SOC). This effort is for development and fielding of standardized operations centers to provide mission data and tasking information to the aircrew and disseminate and\/or exchange mission data with decision-makers and the intelligence community.\n\n3. MQ-9 Upgrade. This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data\/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed on specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.\n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties. The aircraft is designed to primarily prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) using a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Electro-optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill weapon capability (hunter-killer). It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).\n\nThe MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capabilities to meet evolving mission needs through incremental upgrades, including but not limited to: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight; increasing operational range and endurance; propulsion system improvements; integrated redundant avionics; incorporating provisions for a Foreign Military Sales(FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; communications upgrades to include datalink encryption, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, secure voice and data communications; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; sensor\/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); software updates needed to support new configurations and development; integrating additional precision weapons; hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station.  The program will also complete airworthiness and weapon system certification and accreditation; produce applicable training for payloads funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF), Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons). Development efforts will address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues. Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.\n\nThe GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support reach back Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to: perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; and enable personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status. It incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions. Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) is used for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within LOS range of the LRGCS. GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to other MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance\/certification and accreditation requirements.\n\nThis project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools."

L3Comm is the prime contractor for the Predator Satellite Link. Raytheon is the prime contractor for the MTS-B EO\/IR sensor system. Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process (referred to as a Hybrid Release). This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide."

The first two releases are under the auspices of the baseline MQ-9 Development and Fielding program. Candidate Release 3 and 4 upgrades include, but are not limited to, implementing an Autonomous Systems upgrade, upgrading the data links to use the new Bandwidth Efficient Common Data Link (BE-CDL), enhancing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and AGM-114 HELLFIRE targeting and employment, integration of new weapons such as Guided Bomb Unit (GBU)-54, and Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) implementing the results of the Technology Insertion program, and software updates needed to support new configurations and development. Development efforts will address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues. Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning."

Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process (referred to as a Hybrid Release).  This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide."

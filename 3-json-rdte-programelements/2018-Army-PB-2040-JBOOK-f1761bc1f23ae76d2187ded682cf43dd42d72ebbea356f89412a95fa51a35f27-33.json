Platoon Power Generator - PM E2S2: This project supports the demonstration and development of a Platoon Power Generation (PPG). The SUP PPG (1kW Generator) will provide small units with sufficient portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8). It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices.\n\nProject EY2 - Integrated Soldier Power Data System - Core:  Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core, Conformal Wearable Battery, Squad Power Manager (SPI) fills the power and energy gaps created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as situational awareness displays, GPS systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices.  \n\nProject EY4 - Universal Battery Charger:  Universal Battery Charger (UBC) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, by providing a sole charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries.  \n\nProject S75 - Nett Warrior (NW), [named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient COL Robert Nett], previously known as Ground Soldier System (GSS):  NW provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster and more accurate decisions in the tactical fight.  This translates into Soldiers being at the right place, at the right time, with the right equipment making them more effective, more lethal, and more survivable in the execution of their combat mission.\n\nProject DX7 - Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS):  TCAPS enables Soldiers to communicate over radios in combat environments while simultaneously providing hearing protection from both steady state and impulse noise."

TCAPS protects Soldiers against harmful impulse and steady-state noises characteristic of combat environments while also enabling Soldiers to communicate with each other using voice communications over a tactical radio, while TCAPS-Lite provides protection for Soldiers without a radio. Both systems enhance survivability and situational awareness by allowing Soldiers to selectively amplify faint sounds that would not be otherwise audible or intelligible. TCAPS and TCAPS-Lite reduces Soldiers\u2019 noise induced hearing damage. Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.\n\nTCAPS and TCAPS-Lite contribute to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injuries. TCAPS Program of Record will continue to employ commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions that are evaluated periodically. The commercial solutions that meet the technical requirements and are rated the best by the Soldiers will transition to production and fielding.\n\nJustification: FY18 RDTE funding supports continued testing and evaluation of enhanced protective hearing devices for soldiers in combat environments. Funding also supports annual efforts to relook technology for improved future capabilities."

Specific systems of SPI are the Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core (ISPDS-C), the Conformal Wearable Battery (CWB) and the Squad Power Manager (SPM). This RDT&E line develops power sources and solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier, but for the team and squad. These power solutions are intended for use in the most austere operating environments and include, but are not limited to, individual Soldier worn systems, integrated power management, and renewable energy. SPI systems will enable dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions more efficiently, for longer durations and with fewer battery resupplies. SPI systems will also reduce the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries, and allow dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort is consistent with the Soldier Protection Capability Development Document (CDD) (March 2011), Operational Energy Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) (26 April 2012), the Sep 2013 Small Unit Power CDD (26 September 2013), and the draft SPM, ISPDS-C with Conformal Central Power Source (CCPS) Capability Production Document (CPD).\n\nJustification: Beginning in FY18, funding for ISPDS-C was realigned from Program Element: 0604827A (Soldier Systems \u2013 Warrior Dem\/Val)\/Project: S65 (Soldier Power). FY18 RDTE funding develops power sources and solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier, but for the team and squad.

For example, the SPM acquisition strategy will consist of two phases: Phase one includes the purchase of test articles using the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Special Operational (Spec Ops) Equipment Tailored Logistic Support Program (TLSP). Phase two includes the procurement of additional test articles through Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts established through the Army Contracting Command (ACC). The Project Manager office will establish IDIQ contracts to support the SPI requirements over time. Each SPI system will be procured under purchase orders for production quantities that will be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract."

The UBC charging solution is suited for the squad and platoon and intended for use in the most austere operating environments and can draw power from wall outlets, vehicle power, and solar power sources. The UBC enables dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions with fewer battery resupplies, thus reducing the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries. Develops the vehicle integration kits that allow for the UBC to be mounted on vehicle platforms. The UBC capability also allows dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort is consistent with the Operational Energy ICD (26 April 2012) and the Universal Battery Charger CPD (27 May 2015).\n\nJustification: Beginning in FY18, funding for Integrated Soldier Power Data System-Core (ISPDS-C) was realigned from Program Element: 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem\/Val)\/Project S65 (Soldier Power). FY18 RDTE funding develops battery power solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier and the team and squad."

Power solutions address energy deficits resulting from increased power demands associated with providing the Soldier with increased situational awareness displays, Global Positioning System (GPS) systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices. The Soldier and Small Unit Power system develops and tests power sources and solutions suited for the individual Soldier, team, squad, and platoon in the most austere operating environments, while also providing dismounted Soldiers the ability to execute their missions more efficiently, for longer durations and with fewer battery resupplies. An integrated Soldier power system will provide the Soldier with a wearable power supply that will be significantly more efficient than carrying separate batteries for each device. Soldier power systems will also reduce the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries, and allow dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle,  or supply train. SUP develops systems that consist of the Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core (ISPDS-C), Conformal Wearable Battery (CWB), Squad Power Manager (SPM), Universal Battery Charger (UBC), and Soldier Power Generation (SPG) Technologies. Develops and evaluates additional sources of power such as individual Soldier worn systems, renewable energy, and kinetic energy harvesting technologies. This effort is consistent with the Sep 2013 Small Unit Power CDD, the Dec 2011 Operational Energy ICD, and the Mar 2011 Soldier Protection CDD, and the Universal Battery Charger CPD (May 2015).\n\nJustification: Beginning in FY18, funding for SUP was realigned to Program Element: 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem\/Val)\/Projects: EY2 (Integrated Soldier Power Data System - Core) and EY3 (Soldier Power Generator) and EY4 (Universal Battery Charger). Under this realignment Soldier and Small Unit Power will continue to develop and test power solutions for the ISPDS, UBC, CWB, SPM and SPG technologies.\n\nPlatoon Power Generator - PM E2S2: This project supports the demonstration and development of a Platoon Power Generation (PPG). The Small Unit Power PPG (1kW Generator) will provide small units with sufficient portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8). It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices. It will provide sufficient power to recharge and power all Platoon equipment and fulfill residual power gaps at the Squad and Soldier level. The generator will provide Platoon power for charging batteries when away from vehicles in Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT), Armor Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) and as a power source for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in austere environments.  FY17 funds will be used for the preparation of MS \"B\" and allow for the award and management of R&D contracts to two manufacturers to develop and demonstrate a 1kW PPG in FY18."

These initiatives range from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to developmental efforts. The type of solicitation depends on the maturity of the technology.  The power initiatives will be evaluated through scheduled test and evaluation events, and if successful, selected for procurement and subsequent fielding and sustainment. The acquisition strategy varies by product. For example, the SPM acquisition strategy will consist of two phases:  Phase one includes the purchase of test articles using the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Special Operational (Spec Ops) Equipment Tailored Logistic Support Program (TLSP).   Phase two includes the procurement of additional test articles through Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts established through the Army Contracting Command (ACC). The Project Manager office will establish IDIQ contracts to support the SUP requirements over time. Each SUP system will be procured under purchase orders for production quantities that will be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.\n\nPEO CS\/CSS Effort on the Platoon Power Generation - PM E2S2:\n\nFull and open competitive acquisition will be conducted culminating in an award of up to two (2) Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contracts supporting a 24 month Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  Two selected contractors will be awarded EMD contracts and will separately perform a 15 month effort (Phase I) to fabricate and produce the minimum order of 10 Small Unit Power Platoon Power Generation (1kW Generator) systems (5 per vendor). Phase I will be followed by a down-select evaluation to choose the manufacturer that could produce the best value system. During Phase II, selected vendor will produce 5 additional systems to undergo developmental test (DT), a logistics demonstration (LD), pre-production qualification test, and limited user \/ operational test (LUT\/OT). Upon successful completion of these tests and completion of logistics supportability, the performance data and Soldier's feedback will be utilized in preparation for Milestone C (MS C)."

Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to the tactical vehicle-mounted leaders so that when dismounted, the leader still maintains the common operating picture (COP) and has continuous situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and enhanced communications to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight. Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.\n\nThe continued development and integration of the NW program also integrates applications from other programs aimed at considerably reducing the weight and bulk of the dismounted Soldier's load by using a single End User Device. The NW program harnesses Soldiers' experience in combat operations and employs combat veterans for Soldier feedback enhancing human factors design and fightability of the system. This project funds the following: 1) Incorporation of additional new hardware applications and capabilities into Nett Warrior, 2) Yearly developmental and operational tests of the NW with continually advancing commercial smart device technology inserted, 3) Software development for planned updates, 4) Integration of new End User Devices with the existing and re-competed Army Tactical Radios, including vehicle power integration, 5) Government led integration and system engineering and program management, and 6) Conduct NW Operational Test and Evaluation with Mechanized and Infantry units in FY16\/17.\n\nNOTE:  Beginning in FY17, funding for Nett Warrior was realigned to 0604818A (Army Tactical Command & Control Hardware & Software)\/Project EQ8 (Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment).  Under this realignment Nett Warrior will continue to integrate, conduct developmental and operational test, etc. as stated above."

The NW is focused on Team Leader and higher echelons and provides an integrated secure information-centric Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) mobile application-based computation platform with data collection, enhanced SA, mission planning, and navigational aid functions overlaid on geo-referenced maps and high resolution imagery throughout a brigade.  The NW enables real-time ground tactical-level knowledge sharing and command and control (C2), directly impacting combat effectiveness and decision-making.  The NW also improves lower echelon intelligence production and analysis capabilities which are central to efficient and effective counter-insurgency warfare.  NW program completed LRIP\/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&E under DOT&E oversight in 4QFY14-1QFY15.  This IOT&E event led to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision is planned for early FY18.  Upon a successful FRP Decision, NW will complete annual production and fielding events based on yearly development, integration and testing of emerging advanced smart devices to lower cost, weigh and power.  To capitalize on commercial industry\u2019s investment in advanced smart device technology as well as innovation and changes within Army, NW requires annual RDT&E funding for integration and evaluation.  Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures."

The ACS capabilities have continually evolved starting with AEGIS Baseline (BL) 2 on Guided Missile Cruisers (CG) 52-58, BL 3 on CG 59-64, and BL 4 on CG 65-73. In FY 1992, AEGIS BL 5 was introduced on Guided Missile Destroyer (DDG) 51-78, BL 6 on DDG 79-90, BL 7 on DDG 91-112, and BL 9 113 and follow.\n\nThe AEGIS Modernization Baselines will provide new technology to replace aging military equipment, extend service life, and maintain combat viability of AEGIS combatants into the future. These baselines reduce combat system maintenance life cycle costs and streamline the development of capabilities. AEGIS BL 8 (Cruiser Modernization) upgraded CG 52-58, while AEGIS BL 9, consisting of an upgraded computing infrastructure and computer program enhancements, will modernize CGs 59,60,62 and DDG 51,52,53,57,61,65 and 69. AEGIS BL 9 will provide updated computer program to CG 52-58 to improve warfighter effectiveness by introducing Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA), SM-6 and Fleet Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) and reduce the number of AEGIS Baselines within the AEGIS Fleet. AEGIS BL 9 will also be introduced on the new construction destroyers, starting with DDG 113 and follow.\n\nAEGIS Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 16 and the required Technical Insertions (TI) 12\/12H\/16 Computing and Display Plant will provide warfighter upgrades to AEGIS Cruisers and Destroyers to include improved Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities (DDG only), SEWIP BLK II, MH-60R Integration, IFF Mode 5\/S, SPQ-9B in the Fire Control Loop, Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC), Condition Based Maintenance, Combat System Boundary Defense, NIFC-CA 2019, and NIFC-CA Collateral #3. ACB16 will support 3 hardware configurations: PHASE 0 AEGIS BL 9.C2.0 TI12 will support 15 DDGs (51\/52\/57\/61\/65\/69\/80\/113-120) and 2 AEGIS ASHORE (AA) facilities (Poland\/Romania); PHASE 1 AEGIS BL 9.C2.1 \/ 9.A2.1 TI12H will support 2 DDGs (79\/83) and 7 CGs (63-65\/66\/68\/69\/71); and PHASE 2 AEGIS BL 9.C2.2 TI16 will support 13 DDGs (81-82\/84-89\/92\/94\/121-123) and 3 CGs (70\/72\/73).  \n\nAEGIS Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 20 and Technical Insertion (TI) 16 will provide critical warfighter upgrades to AEGIS FLT III Destroyers. ACB 20 combat system development and integration efforts will support the Air Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) acquisition milestone requirements and build upon ACB 16 to form the foundation for the AEGIS Flight III DDG Combat System. Provide Computer program updates that can be backfit to AEGIS TI 16 hardware configurations. \n\nAEGIS BL 7.2 will provide a common Computer Program build that consolidates 2 (BL 7.1.3 and BL 7.1R) to one software configuration (BL 7.2) for a 22 ship superset (DDG 91-112). Also addresses operations and maintenance deficiencies to improve warfighting readiness and delivers critical warfighting improvements in air defense.\n\nAEGIS Far Term Interoperability Improvement Plan will address the remaining interoperability issues within fielded AEGIS Combat System configurations to integrate F\/A-18 Digital Air Control (Phase 1) in support of F\/A-18 and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter initial deployment, integration of the Shipboard Gridlock System\/Automatic Correlation (SGS\/AC). These updates will be implemented in a phased approach to align with current and future AEGIS development efforts.\n\nAEGIS Task Force Cyber Awakening will assess and provide corrective actions to improve AEGIS Combat System Computer Program and Hardware configurations against emerging threats within the Cyber arena. These improvements will be implemented within AEGIS Combat Systems currently under development and include updates to Boundary Defense Components (BDC).  \n\nAEGIS BL 5.3.X combines AEGIS BL 5.3.9 and BMD 4.1 into single AEGIS Computer Program enabling a near simultaneous shift from AAW to BMD to AEGIS Flight I\/II DDGs to ensure viability against emerging threats until end of service life (ESL). These improvements will include Computer Program updates to integrate the improved radar performance provided by the hardware upgrades to the SPY-1D radar.\n\nAEGIS BL 5.3 SEARAM Integration and Test program will introduce SEARAM as part of the AEGIS Combat System to address Combatant Commander Requirements to improve warfighter capabilities against advanced anti-ship cruise missiles. These updates will be focused on completing integration and test requirements to validate the performance of the integrated capability. These updates will support Demonstration and Operational Test efforts planned for FY16\/17 and introduction into BL 9 DDGs.\n\nAEGIS IFF MODE 4\/5 Integration program will address Mode 4 Inoculation, implement Mode 5 IFF within the Fire Control Loop for AEGIS Baselines"

The computer program is a Government Furnished Computer Program (GFCP) deliverable to the Production Test Center for equipment test and check out. Future Combat System deliveries will be provided in Advanced Capability Builds (ACBs) and Technology Insertions (TIs) using the Combat System Engineering Agent (CSEA) contract.

Capability Development and integration are related to Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Underwater, Surface, and other warfare areas.  Capability enhancements and upgrades include development of re-useable common components that can be leveraged by SSDS MK2 combat systems, and\/or integration of re-usable common components developed by the TSTC Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT) Program and Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) MK2 TSTC Training Improvement programs to meet AEGIS combat system training requirements.\n\nTSTC provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict, realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas (e.g. NIFC-CA and BMD missions to support IAMD). TSTC provides ships' Commanding Officers and Battle Group\/Battle Force Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Organization, the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F Fleet Synthetic Trainers (FSTs)."

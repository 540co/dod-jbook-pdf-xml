It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the AF inventory. The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision (and non-precision) weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current structural service life extends beyond 2040.\n\nThe B-1B modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing.\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED TARGETING POD (FITP)\nThe Fully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) modification permanently integrates the Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) capability into the B-1B's avionics flight software architecture and replaces the B-1B's Temporary T-1 Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) \/ Laptop Controlled Targeting Pod (LCTP) system with a digital, high-definition video-streaming targeting pod. This will provide increased B-1B aircrew situational awareness, weapons de-confliction, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) within the Combat Air Forces (CAF). FITP will provide robust combat targeting processing power, computing speed and throughput for aircrew mission planning, and a permanent sustainment support structure. It will provide all four crew members access to targeting pod information displayed on digital-quality video using the Integrated Battle Station (IBS), Multi-Function Displays (MFDs), and the cursor controller. FITP will address the aircrew ergonomic issues caused by the current system configuration, allowing more rapid prosecution of targets through improved integration with Avionics Flight Software (AFS) capabilities. In addition, FITP will provide growth capability for implementation and interaction with follow-on systems to augment targeting pod use. Furthermore, the FITP removes the need for an Interim Contractor Support (ICS) sustainment support structure, which will resolve DMS issues.\n\nMODE 5\/S AUTOMATIC SURVEILLANCE BROADCAST (ADS-B) OUT\nB-1B Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5\/S is the replacement for the B-1B Mark XII IFF Mode 4. Mode 5 will provide secure target identification and will be a response system for combat identification. Mode Select (Mode S) and ADS-B Out provides timely aircraft position and flight path prediction to receiver units for aircraft, Air Traffic Control, and the Air Defense System . The IFF Mode 5 upgrade uses an automated system that responds to interrogations to avoid the loss of B-1B aircraft through fratricide. Mode 5 is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) mandate. Funds are included to accommodate the DoD mandate as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.\n\nRADIO CRYPTO COMPLIANCE \nThe B-1B Radio Crypto Compliance requirements originated to meet DoD mandates by a classified need date. If the requirements are not met, the B-1B is at risk of losing secure Line of Sight (LOS) and BLOS communication with ground and air forces. The Air Force is in the process of negotiating a short-term waiver to the mandate.  Without the radio crypto compliance the B-1B will not be able to participate in CONUS\/OCONUS military operations. The program replaces the existing radios with crypto-compliant radios providing BLOS communications. Funds are included to accommodate the DoD mandate as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.\n\nMultifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) - Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)\nThe B-1B Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) - Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) replaces the existing MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) 1 Link 16 terminal to meet National Security Agency (NSA) Crypto Modernization (CM) Device Cease Key and FAA Frequency Remap mandates: Current systems become non-compliant in 2025. MIDS-JTRS resolves all LVT 1 deficiencies and adds substantial combat capability enhancements to Link 16 Enhanced Throughput (LET) and Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN-4) with Concurrent Retention Receive (CRR). MIDS-JTRS also provides multi-datalink capability, improving situational awareness and allowing rapid in-flight retargeting in a cooperative combat environment. Funds are included to accommodate DoT\/DoD-approved Frequency Remap and Crypto Modernization Device Cease mandates as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.\n\nBomb Rack Unit 56 (BRU-56) \nThe Bomb Rack Unit 56 (BRU-56) upgrade will mitigate a safety risk present within the legacy BRU-56 ejector rack. The upgrade will alleviate the deficiency within the current ejector rack as well as add increased carriage capability. Prolonged use has resulted in a deficiency of the rivets within the linkage of the rack. This deficiency led to multiple failures, to include one Class A mishap in 2003, one Class C mishap in 2010, and multiple ground mishaps. The BRU-56 modification guards against future bomb rack mishaps and the possibility of a catastrophic aircraft loss as well as the loss of life.\n\nGAP AND INTEGRATION ANALYSIS\nProgram funds cover engineering\/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and the auxiliary equipment needed for development projects that have not yet been fielded. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. Costs includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs, total ownership cost, as well as initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts for improving weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, and reliability. All B-1B development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. Funding is also required to ensure test asset availability for testing of aircraft RDT&E efforts. \n\nThis PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-1B weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This will provide increased B-1B aircrew situational awareness, weapons de-confliction, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) within the Combat Air Forces (CAF). FITP will provide robust combat targeting processing power, computing speed and throughput for aircrew mission planning, and a permanent sustainment support structure. It will provide all four crew members access to targeting pod information displayed on digital-quality video using the Integrated Battle Station (IBS), Multi-Function Displays (MFDs), and the cursor controller. FITP will address the aircrew ergonomic issues caused by the current system configuration, allowing more rapid prosecution of targets through improved integration with Avionics Flight Software (AFS) capabilities.

Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of a qualified foreign item in the United States.  Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. Defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement.

Perform Electro-Magnetic Interference testing of prototypes to ensure there is no degradation to nearby communications systems as well as evaluate detectability of the soldier with handheld radios connected to the e-textile vest.  Phase 3 will support a Go\/No-Go decision by evaluating test data to determine if the hardware is mature enough to warrant evaluation in a field environment.

Applications of particular interest are those able to provide an innovative technology offset and\/or cost calculus advantage.  Our allies have made particular progress in the development of systems that offer a significant cost advantage in procurement or operation and reduce the amount of manpower necessary to effectively conduct operations.  In addition, FCT will continue to seek out increased interoperability across platforms and systems.  These technologies will be likely candidates for evaluation under the FCT program."

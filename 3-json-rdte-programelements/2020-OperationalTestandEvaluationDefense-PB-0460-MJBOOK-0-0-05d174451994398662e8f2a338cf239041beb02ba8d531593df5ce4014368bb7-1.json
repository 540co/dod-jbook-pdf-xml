            "val": "This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME).  \n\nThis Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives. JLF was initiated in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets. Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command, and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to increase the affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of Tri-Service aircraft through joint coordination and development of survivability technologies, design tools and assessment methodologies.  The JASP coordinates and conducts RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability, and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) and is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E.\n\nThe Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME) was chartered 50 years ago to serve as Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) focal point for munitions effectiveness information. The JTCG\/ME produces Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) that are the sole source for all Joint Service Authenticated non-nuclear weapons effectiveness data and methodology for DoD. The JMEMs are the \u201chow to\u201d manuals for putting ordnance on target and as such, directly impacts combat readiness, effectiveness, and survivability. JMEMs are used by the Warfighters in operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training; by the DoD, Joint, and Service planners in force-on-force modeling, mission area analysis, requirements studies and weapon procurement planning; and by the service acquisition community in performance assessment, analysis of alternatives and survivability enhancement studies. The JTCG\/ME continually evolves weapons effectiveness and target vulnerability data, standards, methodologies, and processes based on the strategic environment for better munitions effectiveness evaluation and support to a more lethal force. JTCG\/ME also increases efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department\u2019s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering and targeting capability to Coalition partners. The JMEM requirements and development processes are driven by operational lessons learned (Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support and Freedom Sentinel), Joint Staff Data Call and the needs of Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Military Targeting Committee (MTC) guided by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5140.01, Munitions Requirements Process (MRP) - DoD Instruction (DoDI) 3000.04 and Operational Users Working Groups (OUWGs) input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. Considerable effort goes into these User forums to establish Warfighter requirements for current and future JTCG\/ME products, as well as continued training events and day-to-day support -- all with the goal of enabling greater force lethality, strengthening partner capabilities, and optimal use of resources.\n\nThis program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E, JASP and JTCG\/ME programs."

JLF projects have been focused to either (1) build a more lethal force, (2) strengthen alliances and attract new partners, or (3) reform the department for greater performance and affordability.\n\nBuild a More Lethal Force\nIn FY 2019, JLF will continue to investigate means to advance the survivability therefore lethality of our systems in expected theater of operations. As an example, JLF will assess the vulnerability of aircraft to fuel tank fires due to ullage ignition in order to explore methods to reduce aircraft losses while maintaining mission effectiveness.  JLF will investigate the penetration of long yawed rods in order to support munition development such as the AIM-9X, ensuring the desired lethal effects are achieved when these weapons are employed.  JLF will also improve test instrumentation to allow more accurate assessment of imposed forces and crew casualties during mine or improvised explosive device attacks.  JLF will be performing assessments of flammable materiel commonly found in current Naval vessels during operations to better model and prevent fire initiation, as well as promote better design to contain the spread of fire and improve fire suppression techniques.\n\nStrengthen Alliances and Attract New Partners\nJLF is leveraging existing M&S tools and expanding their capabilities to expand evaluation of active protection systems that may be installed on a variety of U.S. platforms to defend against a variety of threats.  This work will be performed particularly in conjunction with efforts of partner nations such as Israel.  Furthermore, JLF will conduct a variety of underwater explosion tests and analyses of effects upon ship hulls.  These tests will be using hardware from a decommissioned Canadian ship and test execution conducted in cooperation with both Canadian and European Union partners.\n\nReform the Department for Greater Performance and Affordability\nIn FY 2019, the JLF program is sponsoring work by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Air Force Institution of Technology to assess the merits of test program methodologies utilized across industry, academia, and government, with the goal of leveraging the merits of these communities toward evaluating lethality\/survivability.  JLF will produce frameworks to allow the DoD to better tailor Live Fire test rigor for a variety of program timelines, including a sensitivity analysis to determine what general qualities are most important to test before rapidly fielding hardware or software.  In addition, JLF will better quantify the point of diminishing returns for major program of record Live Fire test programs in order to maximize return on investment.  Finally, JLF efforts will allow the DoD to better model the combined effects of multiple complex systems in a multi-model threat environment (for example, combined air and ground threats combined with electronic attack and cyber attack), enhancing performance in battle as well as focusing DoD investment in new hardware technologies.\n\nJASP\nIn FY 2019 the JASP will continue work on at least 23 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiate 11 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness. Improve aircraft survivability to fire by increasing the speed and efficiency of fire detection and suppression systems and the accuracy and confidence in prediction of threat initiated fires onboard aircraft. The Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness\nIn FY 2019, JTCG\/ME will continue to develop, enhance, and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness.

Specifically, JTCG\/ME will support approximately 30 JWS training sessions with about 500 students. The training sessions allow users to optimize use of JWS capabilities, while providing JTCG\/ME with critical input on Warfighter use for future development. OUWGs are critical venues for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regard to needed software enhancements and capabilities in support of air\u2011to\u2011surface and surface-to-surface weaponeering. In addition, direct forward support to Combatant Commanders\/Task Forces will be provided to enable target materiel development, weaponeering, and CDE solution development. JTCG\/ME will continue to chair OUWGs, with participation from USCENTCOM, USAFRICOM, USSTRATCOM, USPACOM, USSOCOM, the Services, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Fires Center of Excellence, Service School Houses, the Marine Aviation Weapons\/Tactics Squadron, Operations Support Squadrons, Intelligence Squadrons, and numerous other operational units.\n-Facilitate coalition interoperability and information exchange forums. JTCG\/ME will deliver JWS version releases and standalone Pk Lookup tools to key coalition partners in support of current operations under Foreign Military Sales agreements. These deliveries increase efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department\u2019s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering and targeting capability to Coalition partners, as well as improve the effectiveness of U.S. fires and targeting personnel working in combined environments. JTCG\/ME will also hold information exchange forums via information exchange agreements (IEAs) with the United  Kingdom and Republic of Korea. These exchanges facilitate collaboration on methodologies and efforts of mutual interest in the area of weapons effectiveness\/collateral damage estimation. \n-Develop and enhance processes to supply target vulnerability data to operational and acquisition communities. The JTCG\/ME conducts detailed vulnerability analysis to produce tri-service approved target vulnerability information (i.e., Target Geometric Model (TGM) development, Failure Analysis Logic Tree (FALT), Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), etc). These data are used to feed the approved vulnerability models to generate the target data used on JMEMs. In addition, acquisition programs leverage JTCG\/ME target vulnerability data to conduct detailed analysis of their new capabilities against threat targets. The leveraging of this information saves programs valuable time and resources, and ensures the acquisition community is using consistent and valid threat representation.\n-Support urgent operational needs for target vulnerability data with rapid response surrogation and development of Pk Lookup data for high priority weapons and targets. These specialized products directly assist CCMDs to meet the operational requirements of a dynamic environment as formal products are developed.\n-Continue to collect, approve, and supply weapons characteristics data and standards for the tri-service community to include soon to be fielded systems. These weapons are:  Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) II; Small Guide Munition (SGM) GBU-69; Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) GBU-39; Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM); Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System (JMEWS); Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM); and High speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM).\n-Enhance weapons characterization processes and communication through the JTCG\/ME Test Assistance Group (TAG). The TAG provides a forum that fuses science and art of weapon testing with subject matter experts from all the services and test ranges to review, adopt technologies and methods that reduce expense, time, anomalies, and expanded data collection. JTCG\/ME archives and publishes these weapon characterization standards in updates to the JTCG\/ME Weapon Test Procedures Manual (TPM) used by weapon test ranges. The TAG also facilitates partnerships and leveraging. These technologies and partnerships have the potential to reduce the number of weapon test articles required and remove labor-intensive activities from weapon testing.\n-Update and execute strategic roadmaps for underlying vulnerability and lethality models used as standards by the tri-service community to better support JWS 3.x development and Live Fire Testing and Evaluation (LFT&E). These roadmaps align JTCG\/ME funded and related tasks by other services and programs to facilitate leveraging. In addition, the roadmaps provide a tool for future investment planning to support modeling and simulation validation and resolution of capability gaps. A key roadmap component included several interconnected model sensitivity studies. The goal of these studies is to understand the range of potential model outputs, including stochastic variations in penetration and other processes, so that differences between test data and predictive models can be better understood. This will be used to guide live fire testing requirements for validation of the models for a program office's specific operational envelope. These studies will also provide data to support several model reaccreditations.\n-Develop and accredit Collateral Effects Radii (CER) Reference Tables in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01C, \u201cNo-Strike and the Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Methodology\u201d  for air-to-surface and surface-to-surface weapons, which are the basic data that support the CDE methodology. The JTCG\/ME CER tables and CDE methodology are used in every planned kinetic strike in all Areas of Responsibility Operation (AORs) to meet Commanders\u2019 intent and to minimize civilian casualties. As such, it is critical to the Warfighters\u2019 ability to meet urgent operational needs. JTCG\/ME implements the CER and CDE methodology within the DCiDE tool. DCiDE is an accredited and automated CDE tool that expedites and simplifies the CDE process. DCiDE enables JTCG\/ME to continuously support the CJCSI 3160.01 series, DCiDE was the only automated CDE tool authorized for use in the USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM AORs.\n-Maintain and support DIEE v2.1, DIEE is an enterprise targeting solution that provides both seamless planning and linkage to various mission planning systems and tools in operational units. It is a \u201cGovernment off the shelf\u201d (GOTS) product for advanced target development that integrates Target Coordinate Mensuration (TCM), Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE), Weaponeering, and data basing functions. DIEE was selected as the preferred operational solution of a 2018 Air Force Advanced Target Development (ATD) Software Fly-off based on 135 hours of hands-on time and 451 scored line items. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued guidance stating that,\u201dThe Services, Combatant Commands, and Combat Support Agencies will upload and use DIEE v2.1 for automated CDE to comply with the updated methodology and reporting requirement.\u201d DIEE v2.1 includes user requested enhancements, more advanced JWS interface for weaponeering capability, CJCSI 3160.01C compliant CER Reference Tables and DCiDE for CDE capability, and updated Common Geopositioning Services (CGS) for Precision Point Mensuration (PPM) capability.\n-Continue to develop future DIEE versions that will include CGS updates, 3-D viewer capability, direct Collateral Effects Library (CEL) interfacing, route tool user requested enhancements, battle damage assessment graphic production, and initial android tablet capabilities, while maintaining Warfighter support and future requirements through training and User forums.\n-Leverage CEL and other high fidelity techniques to deliver analysis packages for collateral damage mitigation, post-forensic, and force protect analyses packages to operational Users for high value targets in current operations (i.e., Operations Inherent Resolve, Operation Resolute Support, and Operation Freedom Sentinel). These efforts directly assist Combatant Commands to meet commander\u2019s intent and minimize collateral damage.\n-Continue the Enhanced Weaponeering and Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Program, a multi-year test program focused on enhancing and validating JTCG\/ME CDE tools. This program will support improvements in weaponeering methodology to minimize risk to mission and risk to forces while not increasing risk of collateral damage by providing foundational data for the development of higher fidelity predictive tools. Specific efforts will generate buried ordnance characterization data based upon usage statistics from CCMD Expenditure reports, and AOR specific building debris data to enhance and validate current weaponeering\/collateral damage estimation methodologies required by Strike Approval Authorities to make their strike decision calls. FY 2019 efforts leverage seven FY 2018 testing events and multiple collaboration forums. FY 2019 tests will include four buried ordnance tests to evaluate the effects of burial and weapon class on warhead performance, crater ejecta, and collateral damage, and five building debris characterization tests. \n-Initiate the \u201cBattle Damage Assessment (BDA) of Deliberate and Dynamic Strikes\u201canalysis to directly support the solution offered by the Munition Strategic Portfolio Review to address the current state of the Department's munitions stockpile. The effort is a multi-year task to analyze ongoing strikes required to update JWS to: (1) ensure effective and efficient munition expenditure rates and (2) mitigate the stockpile stress. The analysis approach will include: (1) establishing an analytical cell to provide a detailed and usable Department-level combat assessment of past, current, and future strikes\/weapons employments, (2) establishing an archival database that captures the pre- and post-strike assessments of these engagements, in a format that will be called upon by the JWS to select strike packages with optimal and efficient munition expenditures, and (3) guiding tactics improvement for evolving environments and methodology development to improve weaponeering tools.  Overall impact of effort will result in increased operational agility for the Combatant Commands in terms of weapons employment, as well as directly link current JMEM predictions to operational battlefield performance.\n-Sustain\/support fielded J-ACE v5.3. Efforts will include multiple training and user forums for the fielded product. These forums\nare pivotal for J-ACE developers to understand requirements and align development with other external debrief and analytical\ncapabilities that use J-ACE as the underlying analytical engine to underpin results. Many users leverage J-ACE\u2019s API to link\ndebrief and analysis tools at training and test ranges across the Joint community.

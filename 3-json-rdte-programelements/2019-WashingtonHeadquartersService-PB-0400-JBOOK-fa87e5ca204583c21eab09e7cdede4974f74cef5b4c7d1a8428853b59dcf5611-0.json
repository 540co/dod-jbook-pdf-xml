One of the tenets of this priority is to expand the Department's ability to access leading edge technological innovations through commercial partnerships.  The funding DIUx executes is critical as it incentivizes non-traditional defense sector companies to work with and invest in advancing DoD future capabilities.  \n\n Some of the projects undertaken include:  \n- Hardened Network Defense that provides warfighters improved network security by obscuring vital services and data, thereby significantly decreasing the ability of advancing cyber threats to map, attack or exploit tactical systems.\n- Command, Control, and Situational Awareness web-based software platform that supports user's ability to visualize relevant activities and operational metrics, collaboratively plan and approve defense activities, and monitor\/manage subsequent.  DIUx projects signal investment targets for venture capital opportunities.  While these are small when compared to the DoD total budget, the 3rd party investment multiplier they generate are without equal."

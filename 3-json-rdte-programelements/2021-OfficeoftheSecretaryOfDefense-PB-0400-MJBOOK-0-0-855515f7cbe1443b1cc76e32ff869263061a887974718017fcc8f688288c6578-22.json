            "val": "In alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) modernization priorities, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program conducts prototype demonstrations and experiments to address Combatant Commands' (CCMDs), and Joint Service urgent and emergent warfighting needs.  The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes, generally within two to four years, culminating in a sponsored military utility assessment (MUA), thus enabling scale-up of science and technology from the laboratories into defense acquisition programs.  The key tenets of the JCTD program are to fulfill national objectives to build a more lethal force, strengthen alliances, and enable the DoD to achieve greater performance and affordability.  Following the Undersecretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (USD(R&E))'s Modernization Priority guidance, mission focused areas were co-developed with the Joint Staff to address the Chairman's gap assessment which include, but are not limited to: time-sensitive targeting (TST), advanced electronic warfare (AEW), integrated fires (IF), and fully networked command, control and communications (FNC3).\n\nThe JCTD program achieves its objectives by engaging the CCMDs, the Joint Services, interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the DoD's access to prototyping and innovation.  JCTDs serve as a vehicle primarily for CCMDs to address the Joint force's strategic priority mission areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment.  JCTDs often address technology needs that fall into the seams between the urgent\/emergent needs of CCMDs and Title-10 functions of the Military Services.  Subsequently, JCTD investments are further informed by the CCMDs' integrated priority list, the capability gaps assessed through the Joint Staff, and the Military Services' science and technology roadmaps to achieve warfighter dominance.  As U.S. and partner nations are increasingly orienting toward peer competition in contested environments across multiple, inter-dependent domains, and where feasible through CCMD\u2019s sponsorship, the JCTD program looks to deliver leap-ahead operational capability in reduced time with the coordination of allied research and development (R&D) funding, technology, and industry participation.  The value proposition is to affordably operationalize technologies more quickly, that enable Joint\/Combined forces to access novel\/leap-ahead capabilities.\n\nJCTD outcomes are designed to accelerate technology transition by evaluating and demonstrating prototyped technologies in operationally relevant environments.  Based on the results of the MUA performed under the cognizance of a CCMD sponsor, the products of a JCTD are \"left behind\" for additional assessment or operational use, transitioned to a program of record (PoR), or returned to the technical baseline inventory for further development.  The JCTD program uses MUAs to further inform acquisition pathways to field initial capabilities faster, or prompt major acquisition program decisions prior to milestone A or B approvals.  Therefore, the JCTD program serves as a technology catalyst and transition-bridge between the USD(R&E) and the Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) offices. \n\nIn FY 2019, the JCTD program successfully completed four MUAs and transitioned ten JCTD prototypes.  Nine JCTDs transitioned all or select components to new or existing PoRs, and one operational prototype was directly fielded and is being sustained by non-JCTD funds in operational theaters.  Since the JCTD Program was reframed in 2006, it has executed 116 prototyping projects.  The historical transition rate for the JCTD program is 84 percent, including: 63 prototypes (54 percent) transitioning to a PoR; 29 prototypes (26 percent) providing \"leave-behind\" assets for operational fielding; and five (5) prototypes (4 percent) placed on the General Services Administration schedule.  The remaining 19 prototypes (16 percent) were returned to the technical base for further development or were terminated.  Overall, the JCTD program has directly supported multiple key operations by rapidly accelerating the fielding of game changing technologies and capabilities into the hands of the Joint Warfighter."

Using low probability of intercept\/low probability of detection technology, the Under C-WOLF JCTD accomplished this by exploiting the air-water-interface (AWI) OCOMMS system and the all-through-water (ATW) OCOMMS system to operate at tactically useful bandwidths, depths, and ranges.  The bandwidth for the AWI OCOMMS system provides real-time command and control capability to the submarine.  The bandwidth for the ATW OCOMMS system allows an unmanned underwater vehicle to provide results of extensive surveys to a submarine.  Both systems together increase operational effectiveness of underwater communications in a radio frequency denied, degraded, or contested area, particularly in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and U.S. European Command areas of responsibility."

The three programs are (1) CCMD direct liaison support, (2) JCTD pre-transition and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) CCMD direct liaison support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project identification, demonstration venues, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling them to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD pre-transition: In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD demonstration phase.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD pre-transition funds may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office: Executes a select number of highly classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance."

In these cases, existing PoR documentation (such as the capabilities development document (CDD) or capabilities production document (CPD)) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the PoR.\n-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring PoR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  \n- The results of JCTD can be used to inform research and engineering, or validate a joint requirement per the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System.  This includes identification of the need through development of an initial capability description (ICD) document or accelerating the development of a CDD or CPD to establish a new PoR.\n- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products are listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability."

            "val": "The AF requires a comprehensive set of indoor and outdoor test facilities to implement the Air Force Electronic Warfare (EW) Test Process in order to test EW systems, including Directed Energy (DE).  To manage program risk effectively throughout the EW weapons system acquisition process, and to conduct T&E effectively and efficiently, a broad multi-spectrum integrated set of T&E capabilities, ranging from Modeling and Simulation (M&S), to full-scale chamber testing, to flight testing on open-air ranges (OAR), is required. The EW Test Process Support task provides investment management and coordinated technical oversight of EW T&E facilities, including studies, analyses, and related documentation.  Additionally, successful EW capabilities in battle are predicated upon a thorough understanding of the threat.  To meet that requirement, this PE also includes funding to acquire foreign materiel, and to thoroughly test and evaluate that foreign materiel to understand how those threat systems affect and are affected by our EW systems.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

This funding is used to improve and modernize threat system simulators, stimulators, emitters and supporting infrastructure to sufficiently and cost effectively test and evaluate current and future weapon systems' ability to perform in realistic EW threat representative environments. The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) at Holloman AFB, NM, provides timely, accurate, and secure RCS and antenna measurements for tri-service and joint program offices, DoD laboratories, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and industry. The NRTF tests fielded and developmental systems and technologies to meet Low Observable (LO) and EW customer requirements. The Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF) at Eglin AFB, FL, and the Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) at Edwards AFB, CA, provide the ability to realistically evaluate hardware and software components of US weapon systems against manned hardware threat representations throughout the acquisition process. The GWEF provides simulations of advanced Infrared (IR) Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) and Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs), IR and Laser countermeasure functions, and the integration of actual threat hardware and ground clutter into advanced threat IR missile simulations. DIADS provides mission level simulations of both algorithm-based and man-in-the-loop-based enemy command and control (C2) capabilities that integrate early warning radar detection, SAM engagement capabilities, and limited ground-controlled fighter intercepts.  The Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB, CA, and the Joint Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems (J-PRIMES) facility at Eglin AFB, FL, both provide threat-representative EW emitters and stimulators to replicate a variety of land, sea and airborne threats in a controlled RF environment to evaluate full-scale weapon systems. The BAF additionally provides an ability to perform Electromagnetic Interference\/Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) testing to ensure radars, jammers, radios, and other flight-critical electronic systems will not interfere with each other during a mission. The Central Inertial and GPS Test Facility (CIGTF) at the 704th Test Group at Holloman AFB, NM provides threat-representative GPS jammers and laydowns in both lab and open-air environments to test avionics systems' performance when under various GPS-denial conditions.  Provides EW test process support, conducting requirements analyses and other studies in support of AF T&E investments in test infrastructure and capabilities.\n\nIn previous R-2 Exhibits, EW T&E modernization efforts within this PE's BPAC were identified via two mission area categories: Improvement and Modernization (I&M) and EC Test Process Support.  To more accurately align this R-2 Exhibit with the funding\/execution baseline for this BPAC, the two aforementioned mission area categories have been combined into a single mission area titled, \"Electronic Warfare Ground Test Resources\"."

Items considered for these Foreign Materiel Acquisition (FMA) funds are included in the prioritized Air Force FMA Top 20 list established each year. Each Major Command (MAJCOM) prepares and approves a Foreign Materiel - Mission Requirements Statement for each requirement.  Annually, the MAJCOM commanders establish a list of their top 20 requirements. The MAJCOMs' requirements lists are integrated and prioritized into a classified Air Force requirement list.  Each MAJCOM then approves the FMA Top 20 List and final validation comes from the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.  System analyses are based on and driven by acquisitions.  The USAF provides assessments and data for threat systems to all DoD components."

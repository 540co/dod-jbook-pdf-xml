Joint funding is programmed in the Navy PE 0605030N and Air Force PE 0605030F. Prior to submission of the President's Budget, the funding is consolidated in the Army PE (0605031A) for execution.\n\nNOTE:\nThe Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) of 20 Jan 2014 officially chartered the JTNC, assigned responsibility for the development and sustainment of JENM to the PM Joint Tactical Networks (JTN), and transitioned waveform development and sustainment to the Services. The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Command Control Communications Tactical (C3T) Memos of 25 Jun 2015 transferred all program, development, and configuration control of JENM from Product Manager (PdM) JENM under PM JTN to the Army as Lead service under PdM Tactical Cyber Network Operations (TCNO) under PM Tactical Network (formally PM WIN-T). Waveform development transferred to PM Tactical Radios, who is responsible for program of record development.\n\nJENM, funded in project EF5, is a software only program."

JENM configures numerous Tactical radios such as the ManPack and Rifleman, enabling them to utilize the Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) waveforms such as the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA), Integrated Waveform (IW), and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveforms. Furthermore, JENM provides the Commander the ability to quickly reconfigure critical networks using its Over the Air Management (OTAM) functionality. JENM enhances the S6's ability to conduct Course of Action (COA) Analysis and the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) providing commanders critical information regarding their ability to effectively communicate.  JENM is deployed on the Joint Tactical Networking Environment NetOps Toolkit (J-TNT) from Division to the Company level based upon the Basis of Issue Plan.\n\nEX6 project: Beginning in FY 2018, based on the results of the FY 2017 Army Network Analysis, the EX6 project refocused efforts to improve waveforms for lower and mid-tier networks.  The effort focuses on development to achieve improved performance, network simplification, improved spectrum efficiency and improved Electronic Warfare (EW)\/Cyber resistance.  The planned waveforms may include changes to a mid-tier waveform, SRW 2.0\/Narrow Band, and SINCGARS upgrades.  This new capability must be completed by FY20-21 to support future tactical radio procurements.  \n\nFY 2020 Base RDTE dollars in the amount of $40.808 million supports the continued development of the Waveforms and JENM, testing support and the program management office."

PdM Waveforms' technology assessments, integration, and configuration management enable more fluid and swift updates to the Unified Network capabilities by focusing on the Soldier's mission and safety.\n\nPdM Waveforms delivers, maintains, and upgrades portable, interoperable, mobile ad hoc networking waveforms (MANET), advance networking waveforms, and network enterprise services to enhance tactical warfighting capabilities. PdM Waveforms provides the Lower Tactical Internet with a suite of waveforms and network services that are: (1) Interoperable - used by all Services; (2) Capable of operating on a variety of hardware platforms, both Program of Record and non-developmental commercial radios; (3) Secure - meet all Department of Defense and US Government information assurance requirements; (4) Operationally relevant - quickly and effectively meet evolving network mission requirements of Combatant Commanders and the Services; and (5) Affordable - drive down procurement and support costs via a robust, competitive market which adheres to open government standards.  \n\nPdM Waveforms will remain agile to accommodate emerging warfighter needs by refocusing effort strategies to address the following:\n\n  - Work with Industry Partners to assess, analyze, and vet Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)\/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) waveforms in support of the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN)  \n  - Pursue alternative waveforms to reduce the complexity of MANET\n  - Improve spectral efficiency\n  - Seek Electronic Counter-Counter Measure (ECCM) improvements for operations in contested environment\n  - Implement improvements that allow the tactical radios to be operated in a radio silence mode.\n\nFY 2020 Base RDTE dollars in the amount of $25.484 million supports the continued development of the waveforms, testing support, and the program management office."

The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army LandWarNet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies. EMC supports Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forcible entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command.  \n\nThis program is designated as a DoD Space Program."

Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future."

MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial & International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.\n\nFY 2017 funds support the continued systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the follow-on Wideband AoA, and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations.\n\nFY 2018 and out funding will be realigned to 1203142A\/FE2 to reflect the new Major Force Program 12 (MFP12) Space configuration."

T2C2 will provide a high bandwidth tactical network extension for small unit CPs operating beyond line-of-sight from their higher headquarters and for teams operating outside the full tactical network architecture. The acquisition strategy leverages an existing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase III Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract supporting the commercialization of the preceding SBIR efforts. T2C2 will utilize a two-level maintenance concept, will be Soldier-maintained, and initially supported by Interim Contractor Support. An analysis will be conducted to determine the ultimate supportability path. This strategy will allow a capability to be integrated and delivered quickly to support a limited deployment of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units in FY17 required for Production Verification and the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), with Full-Rate Production (FRP) planned for 4Q FY17."

The MDA signed an ADM on 11 May 2015 selecting the KuKa Antenna and Radome for the Full Operational Capability (FOC). An ADM was signed on 20 May 2015 granting approval to enter into production and deployment phase.  \n\nDue to rephasing of FY17 OPA funding into FY18\/19, program has been restructured.  Initial Operational Capability met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on\/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Node (KEN).   Full Operational Capability (FOC) is 35 C-17s, seven KENs and 21 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN) and an airborne command post suite (CASPAN).  FOC is currently projected for FY20.

JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information, automated tools, and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft, weapon, or sensor missions, load mission data into aircraft and weapons, and conduct post-mission analysis. JMPS is a mission critical system which is a co-development effort between the United States Navy (USN) and United States Air Force (USAF). Common requirements are identified and core JMPS capabilities are developed and prioritized in an evolutionary approach. An individual JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) is a combination of the JMPS framework, common components, unique planning components (UPCs), federated applications, and the necessary system hardware required to satisfy mission planning objectives. Most tactical naval aviation platforms are dependent solely on JMPS to plan precision guided munitions, sensor systems, tactical data links, secure voice communications, and basic Safety of Flight functions. \n\nThe JMPS Increment 4 release delivers JMPS FW 1.5 and transitions JMPS from Windows 7\/32-bit Operating System (OS) to Windows 10\/64-bit OS. Transition to 64-bit allows for memory space expansion to accommodate future Microsoft Operating Systems, emerging technologies, and critical cybersecurity updates. Increment 4 development requires software conversion and refactoring to address memory limitations and system errors resulting in JMPS computer crashes. The transition from the current 32-bit architecture to a 64-bit architecture provides additional memory access, increased planning efficiencies; creating an increased stability in the architecture resulting in fewer system crashes and improved cybersecurity. Delaying JMPS 64-bit transition efforts (Increment 4) will allow existing system crashes to persist, and will decrease system stability in the future due to platform capability enhancements that require increased amounts of data and processing power.\n\nNext Generation Naval Mission Planning, a new start program in 2018, will provide a new mission planning system, with improved mission management, and post-flight mission analysis capabilities on a modular\/services architecture. Next Generation Naval Mission Planning will deliver collaboration and automation capabilities and provide revolutionary improvements in workflow, usability, cybersecurity, portability of mission planning, mission management, and post-flight mission analysis functions across multiple hardware configurations."

The primary focus of this system is to provide an automated capability to assist planners with mission analysis, course of action development and automated creation of doctrinal orders based on planning data in the system.  Current expeditionary planning is done manually on paper charts.  JMPS-E provides a digital map enabling better response times to changing plans, easier distribution of planning artifacts and a reduction in human error during the planning process.  The variety and geographically separated nature of forces involved with Ship to Shore Maneuver amplifies the need for web-based technologies to enable collaborative planning, improve overall situational awareness and enable the monitoring of mission execution from different locations.  The primary outputs are tasking orders, route plans, battlespace geometries and decision briefs.  The system will also incorporate modeling and simulation tools to rehearse and deconflict mission plans."

Additional phases focused on strike planning requirements (i.e., support Precision Guided Missions and other tactical data intensive missions) in order to migrate platforms from legacy mission planning systems to JMPS.  The USAF continued development of JMPS Framework Versions 1.3 and 1.5 and owns the Mission Planning Enterprise Contract, which is used for JMPS Framework software development.  The USN integration and fielding strategy supports a Mission Planning Environment (MPE) focus, where the JMPS Framework and other software components are integrated, tested, and fielded by T\/M\/S.  The USN Increment 4, and beyond, will address increased Mission Planning system capabilities required by the 21st Century Warfighter and modernizes the architecture of JMPS to address technological obsolescence.  As platforms plan their migration to newer versions of JMPS, the acquisition strategy, plan, and program baseline will be updated in order to divest legacy mission planning systems, meet the evolving requirements for integrated mission planning, and lower total life cycle cost."

WASP is approved by Air Warfare Division (N98) as a flight clearance implementation system for the F\/A-18 A, A+, B, C, D, D (RC), E, F, EA-18G; potential support for other platforms, to include F-35.  WASP components will alert pilots if their planned weapon release conditions meet flight clearance limits, will result in bomb-to-bomb collisions, bomb-to-aircraft collisions, aircraft overstress, or excessive risk of aircraft loss\/damage in the event of fuze early bursts. Weapon employment planning is fundamental to the Joint Capability Area of Force Application and joint mission areas of Strike and Amphibious Warfare.  WASP provides the Navy and Marine Corp with weaponeering capabilities that are critical requirements for Interdiction, Armed Reconnaissance and Close Air Support mission planning.  Therefore, WASP product availability is critical to successful employment of the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS)  for the F\/A-18 A-F and EA-18G.  The WASP product encompasses a multitude of Government Furnished Information software components and tools (aircraft target maneuver simulations, weapon flyout models, target probability of damage calculators).  WASP products will require updates as emergent requirements for new aircraft T\/M\/S, stores and weapons are approved, new flight clearances and flight restrictions are issued by Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters (NAVAIRSYSCOM), and developing WASP as a software application."

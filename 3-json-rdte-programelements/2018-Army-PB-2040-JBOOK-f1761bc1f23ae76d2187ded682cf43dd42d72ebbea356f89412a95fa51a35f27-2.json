All radios awarded a contract will be required to go through the Qualification Test (QT) to qualify for a Customer Test (CT) and gain eligibility to participate at the Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers. The QT and CT will be executed by Electronic Proving Ground and will serve as risk reduction events prior to the IOT&E as opposed to developmental test to support incremental system improvement.\n\nThe QT phase will facilitate selection of the radios able to participate in the CT. The QT will validate the manufacturer\u2019s ability to meet the minimum functional requirements identified in the Performance Requirements Document. Radios that successfully demonstrate key capabilities during QT will proceed to the CT; however, there will be an opportunity to re-enter competition during an On-Ramp phase in the future. The CT will serve as a risk reduction event for the IOT&E as data from this event will be considered for manufacturer down-select and an initial buy decision.\n\nThe IOT&E will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary \/ Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The operational tests will be designed to validate that the HMS products meets the users\u2019 needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment. Results from the IOT&E will facilitate the delivery orders for Full Rate Production."

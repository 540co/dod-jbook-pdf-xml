Specifically, improvements are needed to strengthen Government Furnished Property management (an identified material weakness) of property loss while in the hands of contractors as well as to implement data exchange standards across the finance and procurement community.  DoD must also implement across enterprise-wide systems the new data standard replacing the Dun and Bradstreet identifier.  The new data element is the Unique Entity Identifier that will impact every finance, logistics, and procurement system across DoD.  Additionally, an enterprise-wide searchable Commercial Item Determination repository will be established as directed in the NDAA. Initial steps will be taken to define a data standard for a Commercial Catalog critical to underpinning DoD\u2019s ability to track prices of commercial items as well as capture item provenance as required in statute. The ability to enhance supply chain risk data mining will continue and the use of robotics will be explored. Issues identified with existing capability for contract closeout, contract clause execution, Contracting Officer Representatives and Purchase Card officials, Procurement Administrative Lead Time and DoD organization hierarchy will continue as operational implementation matures."

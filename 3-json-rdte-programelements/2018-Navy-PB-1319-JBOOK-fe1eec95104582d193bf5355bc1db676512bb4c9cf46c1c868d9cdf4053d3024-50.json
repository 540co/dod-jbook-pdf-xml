Individual efforts focus on developing or evaluating approaches to optimize training, assessments and acquisition functional, mission objectives through more efficient development and use of M&S.  This activity develops methodologies and standards that will result in model and data reusability and interoperability through the formulation of a technical framework.  These standards support the full range of architecture and engineering design requirements across the Navy.  \nThis activity also supports Fleet exercises and experiments through the application of distributed simulations across a wide variety of warfighting and supporting communities.  Specifically, it develops and integrates appropriate M&S into Fleet Synthetic Training (FST), and develops simulation efforts to test and evolve the standards for models, interfaces, and data.  It supports development of tools necessary to enable the seamless access and use of operationally relevant M&S products to support Navy training, warfare assessments and acquisition requirements."

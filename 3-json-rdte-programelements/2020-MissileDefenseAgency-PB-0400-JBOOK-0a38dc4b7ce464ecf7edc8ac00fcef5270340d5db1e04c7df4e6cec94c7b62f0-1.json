The Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) High Energy Laser (HEL) investment incrementally develops scalable, efficient, and compact HEL technology in the laboratory before beginning a high power laser flight test program.  The technology required for tracking the target, aiming the laser, and building flight demonstrators is being developed under the TMI PE (0604115C).\n\nIn FY 2019, this PE provides the Hypersonic Defense Weapon Systems Concept Definition efforts to enable the Warfighter to counter the growing global hypersonic threat.  The concept architectures must provide a kill chain that is highly maneuverable and agile, yet able to engage the hypersonic threats at much greater ranges during the threat's glide phase. \n\nThe Phase I Concept Definition effort will contract with twenty-one industry partners to start development of weapon systems concept architectures through a multi-phased approach to provide a near term capability to defeat hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nFor FY 2020, MDA in coordination with the United States Air Force (USAF) is developing engineering and test requirements to support joint USAF\/MDA program oversight and verification of a USAF system under development to provide a missile defense capability.  Additional details on the USAF system are available at higher classification levels."

This approach has the benefit of simplicity of design, but must address very high energy levels within the single cell.  LLNL successfully demonstrated over 16 kilowatts (kW) in FY 2016.\n\nMDAs key fiber laser investments are targeted at driving the weight per kW of power in the fiber amplifier system down while increasing the individual fiber amplifier power output.  MDA joined with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the USAF to demonstrate 44 kWs in a room-sized, 40 kilogram per kW configuration in FY 2015, to a packaged 7 kilograms per kW, 30 kW system in FY 2018.\n\nSpecific and\/or unique accomplishments to each FY are as follows:"

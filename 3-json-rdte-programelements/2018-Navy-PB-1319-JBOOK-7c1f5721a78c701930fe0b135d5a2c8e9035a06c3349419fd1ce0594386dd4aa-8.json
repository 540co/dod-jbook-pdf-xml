            "val": "The Tactical Command System upgrades the Navy's Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) systems and processes C4I information for all warfare mission areas including planning, direction and reconstruction of missions for peacetime, wartime and times of crises.\n\nTactical Support Center: The Tactical Mobile (TacMobile) program provides evolutionary systems and equipment upgrades to support the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force Commanders with the capability to plan, direct and control the tactical operations of Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft and other assigned units within their respective area of responsibility. Looking ahead, TacMobile provides critical reach-back capabilities between the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft, primarily the P-8A\/Poseidon, and MQ-4C\/Triton, and the Maritime Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Enterprise. These operations include littoral, open ocean, and over land long-dwell surveillance, anti-surface warfare, over-the-horizon targeting, counter-drug operations, power projection, anti-submarine warfare, mining, search and rescue, indications and warnings, and special operations. The missions are supported by the Tactical Operations Centers and the Mobile Tactical Operations Centers.\n\nMission Planning:  The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is the designated automated mission planning system for the Navy.  JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information, automated tools, and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft, weapon, or sensor missions, load mission data into aircraft and weapons, and conduct post-mission analysis.  JMPS is a mission critical system which is a co-development effort between the United States Navy (USN) and United States Air Force (USAF). Common requirements are identified and capabilities are developed and prioritized in an evolutionary approach.  An individual JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) is a combination of the JMPS framework, common components, and the necessary system hardware required to satisfy mission planning objectives.  Most Tactical Naval Aviation platforms are dependent solely on JMPS to plan precision guided munitions, sensor systems, tactical data links, secure voice communications, and basic Safety of Flight functions.  The following type\/model\/series (T\/M\/S) naval aircraft are supported by JMPS:  AH-1W, F\/A-18 A-F, E-2C, EP-3E, EA-6B, AV-8B, S-3, V-22, Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA), EA-18G, MV-22, C-2, MH-53E, P-3, Aircraft Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC), SH-60B\/F, HH-60H, CH-53D\/E, CH-46E, UH-1N, VH-3\/VH-60, AH-1Z, UH-1Y, MH-60R\/S and E-2D. All T\/M\/S are required to transition to Microsoft Windows 7 due to End of Life (EOL) of Microsoft XP (April 2014)using Framework (FW) Version 1.3.5. Custom support for Windows XP is planned to allow remaining naval aircraft to be supported during the transition.  Future JMPS platforms include: MQ-4C (Triton) and CH-53K. The re-architecture of JMPS will support net-centric goals by providing route \"publish and subscribe\" capabilities, transition to 64 bit allows for memory space expansion to accommodate future Microsoft Operating Systems, emerging technologies, and critical Cyber Security updates.  Funding profile includes JMPS baseline efforts for all existing T\/M\/S on Windows 7 32 bit framework while concurrently re-architecting to a 64 bit framework.  64-bit development requires complete software restructure to address memory limitations and system errors resulting in JMPS computer crashes.  The transition from the current 32-bit architecture (4GB RAM) to a 64-bit architecture (196GB RAM) provides additional memory access, increased planning efficiencies; creating a more stabilized architecture with fewer fleet memory crashes.  Delaying JMPS 64-bit transition to the fleet will cause system crashes to continue. It will also delay required mission planning fixes based upon known software obsolescence, and decreases platform stability.  \n\nNaval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS): The NTCSS is a multi-function program designed to provide standard tactical support information systems to various afloat and associated shore-based fleet activities.  The mission is to provide the Navy and Marine Corps with an integrated, scalable system that supports the management of logistical information, personnel, material and funds required to maintain and operate ships, submarines, and aircraft.\n\nThe Naval Operational Business Logistics Enterprise (NOBLE) family of programs will provide direct support to warfighter readiness with maintenance, supply, and personnel administration capabilities using an open architecture framework that incorporates business process re-engineering (BPR) allowing for the consolidation of over 23 standalone application systems.  These capabilities include enhanced situational awareness, planning, execution, personnel administration, and management of maintenance and supply logistics and business functions to ships\/submarines, aviation squadrons, shore operational sites, and expeditionary units with a total user base exceeding 150,000.   NOBLE will meet current and emerging  demands for cyber, Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR), Navy logistics and maritime maintenance  mission requirements, and eliminate over 700 application\/database servers.  NOBLE will deploy to Navy Enterprise Data Centers (NEDC) ashore, the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) afloat, and Department of the Navy (DON) commercial cloud computing environments. \n\nMaritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2) is the next generation C2 solution that will deliver Battle Management Aids (BMA) and Maritime Planning Tools (MPT) to dynamically plan, direct, monitor, and assess maritime operations in support of Joint, Multi-Service, Coalition Forces planning.  MTC2 will leverage a System of Services (SoServ) to deliver capabilities improving decision speed and dynamic synchronization of forces.  BMAs\/MPTs are small, capability-focused deliveries that can be rapidly developed, tested, and fielded.  MTC2 will engage with the OPNAV-led Requirements Governance Board to define and prioritize the BMAs and MPTs that MTC2 will be on deliver and align to the PEO enterprise architecture (Consolidated Afloat Network Enterprise Service (CANES), Agile Core Services (ACS)) for fielding  to all echelons of command (afloat and ashore) within the Navy.  The program's objective is to provide a suite of maritime applications (BMAs\/MPTs) that enable planning, execution, monitoring, and assessment in support of operational and tactical level of war requirements.  MTC2 will field BMAs\/MPTs designed to provide automated and structured support for tactical and operational planning, decision-making, and execution.  MTC2 will incorporate distributed data transfer capability for enhanced operational data exchange between command and control systems, combat systems, logistics, and intelligence systems for timely threat identification, location, and status alongside blue force data.  MTC2 will provide Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) is the Department-wide enterprise solution that enables visibility\/accessibility\/sharing of data applicable to the entire Department of Defense (DoD)  force structure. MTC2 will be the program that fulfills a portion of the Navy's GFM-DI requirements.\n\nNavy Air Operations Command and Control (NAOC2): NAOC2 integrates and tests Air Force program of record systems that provide an integrated and scalable planning system for standardized, secure, and automated decision support for Air Force, Joint, and Allied commanders worldwide. These programs provide automated air operations planning, execution management and intelligence capabilities at the Force level to include fleet commanders, numbered fleet commanders, Commander Carrier Strike Groups, Commander Expeditionary Strike Groups, Commander Landing Forces, and Joint Task Force Commanders. NAOC2 includes Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) and Command and Control Air Operations Suite - Command and Control Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS). C2AOS-C2IS is being developed as a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) service to allow for scalability and integration with Common Computing Environments (CCE). Continuation of these efforts will significantly enhance the Joint Force Air Component Commander and Combined Air Operations Center personnel to plan daily air operations including strike, airlift, offensive\/defensive air, and refueling missions in support of combat operations, addressing the requirement of war fighter distributed planning and execution processes along with significantly improving Joint interoperability. TBMCS continues a hardware transition to CCEs such as Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES). Currently, TBMCS is the key system that is used to conduct real world air planning in the Joint and Navy environments. C2AOS-C2IS will replace TBMCS in a SOA environment while bringing more flexibility to the war fighter.\n\nDigital Warfare Office (DWO): Supports the development of requirements modeling and data science experimentation environment, mission area model-based engineering (MBE) teams, development of digital technical baselines, development of digital architectures, and the development of workforce training in model-based systems engineering.\n\nFORCEnet: Initiative's mission is to deliver Information Dominance by (a) accelerating the transformation to a Distributed, Networked force; (b) achieve interoperability based on Architectures and Standards; and (c) Experiment with, evaluate and employ the enabling technologies.  Effort is a non-acquisition program that is the operational instantiation of FORCEnet. The end-state is a distributed network of weapons, sensors, Command and Control (C2), platforms and warriors."

                "val": "Technical: Not applicable.\n\nSchedule:\n\nTACTICAL SUPPORT CENTER (Project 0486):\nIncrease in FY2018 is in support of the focus on Systems Engineering and Primary Hardware Development efforts as TacMobile approaches the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for Increment 3, to prepare for support of ACAT I P-8A Increment 3 Integrated Test events by FY20.  Specific efforts include: Engineering and development of TacMobile architecture for P-8A Applications Based Architecture (ABA) interface and building an Engineering Development Model with appropriate P-8A ABA interface to enable and test net ready application; Engineering and development of a TacMobile architecture interface for P-8A Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Signals Intelligence (SIGINT);  Engineering, development and integration of Multiple Security Level enclaves, or common solution to remain interoperable with P-8A security interfaces. \n\nNaval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) (Project 3032):\nFunding in Project 3032 decreases from FY2017 to FY2018 as NTCSS transitioned development of tactical support information systems to the Naval Operational Business Logistics Enterprise (NOBLE). Software conversion efforts for Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS) applications, Optimized Intermediate Maintenance Activity (OIMA) and Optimized Organizational Maintenance Activity (OOMA), transitioned to NOBLE, Project 3260 in FY2018.  \n\nNaval Operational Business Logistics Enterprise (NOBLE) (Project 3260): \nFY2018 new start. \n\nMaritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2) (Project 3323): \nMTC2 funding prioritized to address operational and tactical Battle Management Aids (BMAs) and Maritime Planning Tools (MPTs). MTC2 Project Description Document (PDD) outlines the initial project scope to introduce prototype software in a SIPRNET Development Environment to gain fleet feedback on capabilities and requirements for the MTC2 transition to an Acquisition Category (ACAT) program of record. Beginning in FY18, GFM-DI plans and accomplishments will be moving under the MTC2 Project and Program of Record. Increased funding in FY2018 provides the necessary resources for software development and integration necessary to be hosted on the enterprise infrastructure, system test, and production activities (to include logistics) required to deliver an operational planning tool prototype. Specific capabilities developed in FY2018 are enhanced tactical picture, web-enabled interface, plan\/re-plan force allocation, collaboration planning, synchronization and early implementation of a layered cyber defense. Additionally, it provides resources necessary to investigate and transition Science and Technology products to satisfy detailed MTC2 capabilities.\n\nNavy Air Operations Command and Control (NAOC2)(Project 3324): \nUnited States Air Force (USAF) Command and Control Air Operations Suite-Command and Control Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) software development delays due to software maturity and realignment of critical user requirements resulted in a schedule slip\/compression for Navy integration and testing efforts.  Integrated Developmental Test and Operational Tests (OT) now include Capability Package (CP) 3 in addition to CP1 and CP2, with separate OTs added for Afloat and Ashore, and has been aligned to the latest Air Force testing schedule.  CP5 was originally defined as emerging requirements, but has been relabeled by USAF as C2AOS-C2IS modernization, since it will release multiple software modifications and involve multiple integration efforts.\n\nMission Planning (Project 2213):\nTest and Evaluation:\nFramework v1.3.5 MPE integration\/validation has extended from 4th QTR 2015 to 4QTR 2016 to allow full fielding of Mission Planning on the F\/A-18 platform.\nMission Planning schedule FY17 and out is included in Mission Planning PE 0605215N.\n\nFunding:\n\nFORCEnet (Project 9123)\n\n$4.000 million is required to support approved increases for the Digital Warfare Office (DWO).  Funding supports development of requirements modeling and data science experimentation environment, mission area model-based engineering (MBE) teams, development of digital technical baselines, development of digital architectures, and the development of workforce training in model-based systems engineering.\n\nDWO funding will be moved to PU 3425 starting in FY18."

From within Tactical Operations Centers (TOC) at well-supported airfields, TacMobile provides theater Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) commanders a common tactical picture while providing pre-flight and post-flight support to manned and unmanned MPRF aircraft.  From within Mobile Tactical Operations Centers (MTOC), TacMobile supports manned MPRF aircraft at the tactical edge of operations. TacMobile fly-away kits can support manned MPRF aircraft in short-duration expeditionary settings.\nServices provided include analysis and correlation of diverse sensor information; data management support; command decision aids; rapid data communication; mission planning, evaluation and reach-back dissemination of surveillance data and threat alerts to operational users ashore and afloat, and to the Maritime Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Environment.\nTOCs provide Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) capability, air-ground, satellite and point-to-point communications systems; sensor analysis capabilities; avionics and weapons system interfaces and facilities equipment. MTOCs are scalable, mobile versions for operations from remote forward operating airfields. This program assures that existing TOCs and MTOCs are interoperable to fulfill their operational requirements. TOC\/MTOC will continue to provide the ground Command and Control capabilities, reach-back and C4I interfaces for the MPRF Family of Systems (FOS) aircraft and systems evolution including P-8A Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) baseline and Increment 2, and the development of future C4I support capabilities for the P-8A Poseidon Increment 3, Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS), and the MQ-4C TRITON Unmanned Aerial System.\nThe TacMobile program follows an Evolutionary Acquisition approach for adding capabilities that maintain and support MPRF weapons systems. Current requirements for TacMobile are to adapt to a smaller footprint and scalable Network-centric Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) configuration. Additional TacMobile requirements are to simplify and streamline the Pre-Flight Insertion Data (PID) process for mission aircraft, and to satisfy the need for sensor data sharing between aircraft and the Maritime Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Enterprise.\nFY18: Funding supports core TacMobile systems development and testing of Increment 3, and Technical Refresh to Increment 2.1, to maintain interoperability with P-8A Poseidon and the MQ-4C Triton. Specifically this development is intended to align and support P-8A Inc 3 Block 2 Integrated Testing beginning in FY19, increase modularity, establish additional security enclaves and reduce footprint to offset the size\/weight\/cube of additional required aircraft interfaces developed to support P-8A Increment 3, Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS) and emerging Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft operations. Network-centric Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) and airborne C4I integration efforts continue to ensure interoperability with emerging MPRF Aircraft and Sensors, streamline Pre-Flight Insertion Data (PID), facilitate the MPRF ISR and ASW data Processing - Exploitation - Dissemination (PED) process, and reduce TacMobile footprint, enhancing mobility capabilities."

Development to support these new IER's tapered off in FY-12 as the Increment entered the Operational Evaluation Phase.  Development focus then shifted to efforts required to retain fielded IER's and update IER's to comply with emerging and evolving standards associated with P-8A Poseidon Increment 2, and the MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), other Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force (MPRF) Family of Systems (FOS) Aircraft and Systems, and evolving operational employment concepts.

The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is the designated automated mission planning system for the Navy.  JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information, automated tools, and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft, weapon, or sensor missions, load mission data into aircraft and weapons, and conduct post-mission analysis.  JMPS is a mission critical system which is a co-development effort between the United States Navy (USN) and United States Air Force (USAF). Common requirements are identified and capabilities are developed and prioritized in an evolutionary approach.  An individual JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) is a combination of the JMPS framework, common components, and the necessary system hardware required to satisfy mission planning objectives.  Most Tactical Naval Aviation platforms are dependent solely on JMPS to plan precision guided munitions, sensor systems, tactical data links, secure voice communications, and basic Safety of Flight functions.  Over 40 (T\/M\/S) naval aircraft are supported by JMPS.  All T\/M\/S are required to transition to Microsoft Windows 7 due to End of Life (EOL) of Microsoft XP (April 2014) using Framework (FW) Version 1.3.5. Custom support for Windows XP is planned to allow remaining naval aircraft to be supported during the transition.  Future JMPS platforms include; MQ-4C (Triton), P-8, and CH-53K.  The re-architecture of JMPS will support net-centric goals by providing route \"publish and subscribe\" capabilities, transition to 64-bit allows for memory space expansion to accommodate future Microsoft Operating Systems, emerging technologies, and critical Cybersecurity updates.  Funding profile includes JMPS baseline efforts for all existing T\/M\/S on Windows 7 32-bit framework while concurrently re-architecting to 64-bit framework.  Increment 4 which encompasses 64-bit development requires complete software restructure to address memory limitations and system errors resulting in JMPS computer crashes.  The transition from the current 32-bit architecture (4GB RAM) to a 64-bit architecture (196GB RAM) provides additional memory access, increased planning efficiencies; creating increased stability in the architecture resulting in fewer fleet memory crashes.  Delaying JMPS 64-bit transition to the fleet will allow system crashes to continue."

FW Version 1.3.5 incorporates Windows OS 7 and provides additional capabilities for all naval aircraft to include air drop, air refueling and enhanced installation. Funding for FW will be used to support system engineering processes, management interface controls, software architectural analysis, requirements management and a centralized website for Mission Planning Environment (MPE) developers.  FW 1.5 will be incorporated in future FW versions to address migration to .NET environment and to enable interoperability improvements through utilization of services. FW 64 bit development efforts commenced in FY14.  If a transition to 64-Bit architecture is delayed or minimized, the fleet will experience increased mission planning interruptions (crashes) with future Mission Planning Environments (MPE) as a result of legacy and new 32-Bit applications shared utilization of the 4G RAM limitation associated with 32-bit operating system (64-Bit provides 192GB RAM). Additionally, as platform(s) requirements emerge for new and enhanced mission planning capabilities, the demand for more complex integrated applications and software products increases.  Without this planned transition to a 64-Bit architecture, the volume of integrated mission planning capability for the fleet will be limited and restricted. Common Components software updates augment core mission planning capabilities across multiple T\/M\/S."

Current expeditionary planning is done manually on paper charts.  JMPS-E will provide a digital map enabling better response times to changing plans, easier distribution of planning artifacts and a reduction in human error during the planning process.  The variety and geographically separated nature of forces involved with Ship to Shore Maneuver amplifies the need for web-based technologies to enable collaborative planning, improve overall situational awareness and enable the monitoring of mission execution from different locations.  The primary outputs are tasking orders, route plans, battlespace geometries and decision briefs.

Phase I was a combined United States Air Force (USAF) \/ United States Navy (USN) effort that obtained various studies, extensive joint requirements analysis, design to cost estimates, an architecture concept, and development statement of work.  The Program's Phase I was planned to identify reduced costs strategies through software reuse from both USN Tactical Automated Mission Planning Systems and USAF Air Force Mission Support Systems (AFMSS) legacy mission planning programs.  Additionally, this phase provided a risk reduction plan by identifying the most effective migration of existing mission planning systems.  Phase I was awarded to two contractors,  Post Phase I during the down select process, one contractor was selected to develop the JMPS architecture work and Version 1.0 basic flight planning components. Phase II focused on strike planning requirements (i.e., support Precision Guided Missions and other tactical data load intensive missions) in order to migrate platforms from legacy mission planning systems to JMPS.   The USAF continued development of JMPS Version 1.3 and has contractual control of the program which is facilitated via a Mission Planning Enterprise Contract.  The USN continued limited development in JMPS Version 1.2 which was focused on helicopter platform migrations.  USN integration and fielding strategy changed to support a Mission Planning Environment focus, where framework and common components are integrated as bundled packages and fielded by airwings.  The completion of Phase II is targeted for Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) Version 1.3.5, which focuses on a transition to Windows 7 that both the USAF and USN will use.  As platforms plan their migration to JMPS, the acquisition strategy, plan, and baseline will be updated in order to drive the retirement of legacy mission planning systems."

It includes Naval Operational Supply System (NOSS), Naval Aviation Maintenance System (NAMS), Naval Operational Maintenance Enterprise (NOME), and Naval Administration and Personnel System (NAPS).  \n                                                                        \nNOSS will provide enterprise-wide automation of supply, inventory, and financial functions to the Naval supply system.  NOSS incorporates commercial best practices (e.g., Amazon, Wal-Mart, UPS, FedEx, etc.); NOSS will aggregate and analyze logistics data using business intelligence technologies, provide for total asset visibility, optimize business processes at the tactical echelon (field-level) and enterprise support activities, accelerate the ordering\/re-ordering process, and permit monitoring of shipments. NOSS will maintain compliance with statutory, regulatory, and policy mandates of Financial Improvement Audit Requirements (FIAR). NOSS will aggregate and analyze operational data in a Business Intelligence (BI) framework to enable historical and predictive common operating pictures for logistics and readiness performance and requirements.  FY2018 funding provides for acquisition documentation development to support a Milestone B\/C decision. FY2018 funding provides for NOSS systems engineering analysis and design efforts leading up to a NOSS Build Decision 1 (BD1).\n\nNAMS will provide an enterprise-wide aviation maintenance support capability that services all levels of aviation maintenance (organizational, intermediate, and depot) for over 2,100 Navy and Marine Corps aircraft. NAMS will identify and assign aviation artisans, and track all levels of aviation maintenance to completion. Aircraft availability and mission-capable rates will increase with the elimination of current inefficiencies; there will be a reduction in total ownership costs. FY2018 funding provides for software conversion efforts of Naval Aviation Logictics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS) applications. FY2018 funding provides for NAMS acquisition documentation development to support a NAMS Milestone B\/C decision leading to a NAMS BD1.\n\nNOME will provide standardized operational business processes for afloat maritime maintenance activities to all naval ships. NOME will provide end-to-end component tracking, reduce administration time by identifying and assigning artisans to repair shipboard equipment, support moving major repair work ashore, and enable exploitation of embedded sensors in weapon systems that will trigger repair action notification. FY2018 funding provides for a NOME Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  FY2018 funding provides for NOME acquisition documentation development to support a NOME Milestone B\/C decision leading to a NOME BD1.\n\nNAPS will provide Navy-wide personnel and administration data sharing across shipboard and shore-based information systems.  This will eliminate redundant personnel data entry, reduce total ownership costs, and standardize the way personnel and administration data are shared across the Navy. NAPS provides for the efficient use of maintenance personnel with better job\/task and personnel skill matching. FY2018 funding provides for a NAPS AoA.  FY2018 funding provides for NAPS acquisition documentation development to support a NAPS Milestone B\/C decision leading to a NAPS BD1."

MTC2 will leverage a System of Services (SoServ) to deliver capabilities improving decision speed and dynamic synchronization of forces.  BMAs\/MPTs are small, capability-focused deliveries that can be rapidly developed, tested, and fielded.  MTC2 will leverage Science and Technology (S&T) investments and will engage with the Navy Requirements Governance Board to define and prioritize the BMAs and MPTs that MTC2 will be on deliver and align to the Program Executive Office (PEO) enterprise architecture (Consolidated Afloat Network Enterprise Service (CANES), Agile Core Services (ACS)) for fielding  to all echelons of command (Afloat and Ashore) within the Navy.  The program's objective is to provide a suite of maritime applications (BMAs\/MPTs) that enable planning, execution, monitoring, and assessment in support of operational and tactical level of war requirements.  MTC2 will field BMAs\/MPTs designed to provide automated and structured support for tactical and operational planning, decision-making, and execution.  As a software-only program that leverages enterprise infrastructure, MTC2 will provide new and improved capabilities to include an Operational Planning Tool (OPT), an improved browser enabled map visualization that will enable the warfighter to associate tracks to relevant data, past and predicted movements, ingest Meteorology and Oceanography information, and operational overlays.   MTC2's updated architecture will enable future composable C2 capabilities to respond to a more rapid pace in changes in threats and technology.  Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) is the Department-wide enterprise solution that enables visibility\/accessibility\/sharing of data applicable to the entire DoD force structure.  MTC2 will incorporate distributed data transfer capability for enhanced operational data exchange between command and control systems, combat systems, logistics, and intelligence systems for timely threat identification, location, and status alongside blue force data.  MTC2 will be the program that fulfills a portion of the Navy's GFM-DI requirements.\n\nFY 2018 funding will provide prototype development, integration, and testing for two BMA\/MPTs, OPT and Navy Wave on the MTC2 Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) Development Environment.  OPT will provide the capability for a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) to create operations plans\/schedules (i.e., 96-hour plan).  Navy Wave will provide collaborative service that allows users to see other distributed planner's edits in real-time, and works in disconnected, intermittent, and limited (DIL) environments.  The MTC2 SIPRNET Development Environment will be available to the fleet to provide feedback on improvements to OPT and Navy Wave BMA\/MPTs.  MTC2 will update the existing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) prototype at Commander, Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT) and Commander, Sixth Fleet (COMSIXTHFLEET) in FY18.  MTC2 project prototype baseline comprised of OPT and Navy Wave BMA\/MPTs will be demonstrated at Trident Warrior (TW) 18.  FY18 MTC2 will also conduct pre-Milestone B\/Build Decision program and acquisition activities which includes updating all statutory and regulatory documentation to meet Milestone B\/Build Decision requirements. Upon successful Milestone B\/Build Decision, MTC2 will initiate transitioning prototype capabilities to a program of record and initiating program of record development, integration and test activities."

These programs provide automated air operations planning, execution management and intelligence capabilities at the Force level to include fleet commanders, numbered fleet commanders, Commander Carrier Strike Groups, Commander Expeditionary Strike Groups, Commander Landing Forces, and Joint Task Force Commanders. NAOC2 includes Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) and Command and Control Air Operations Suite - Command and Control Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS). C2AOS-C2IS is being developed as a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) service to allow for scalability and integration with Common Computing Environments (CCE). Continuation of these efforts will significantly enhance the Joint Force Air Component Commander and Combined Air Operations Center personnel to plan daily air operations including strike, airlift, offensive\/defensive air, and refueling missions in support of combat operations, addressing the requirement of war fighter distributed planning and execution processes along with significantly improving Joint interoperability. TBMCS continues a hardware transition to CCEs such as Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES). Currently, TBMCS is the key system that is used to conduct real world air planning in the Joint and Navy environments. C2AOS-C2IS will replace TBMCS in a SOA environment while bringing more flexibility to the war fighter. In FY 2018, the program will continue Navy integration and testing for Air Force developed C2AOS-C2IS, with focus on testing of three planned Capability Packages."

In order to develop capability from the top down, the DWO will develop requirements for the system of systems to include all of the associated interoperability requirements. Due to the complexity of this work, the DWO will evolve the traditional requirements development methodology to a model based systems engineering environment that will include associated model extensions, reports, views, configuration management, help desk support, and documentation.  This work will be completed by a series of teams, each focused on a separate threat domain, and made up of system modelers, fleet representatives, program of record representatives, architecture and interoperability experts, etc. The products generated by these teams will include data technical baselines for domain areas with individual profiles for each program of record, coordinated requirements recommendations, and potential areas for S&T and experimentation to fill gaps. The DWO will also  explore  emerging digital technologies including human\/machine teaming.\n\nEach SYSCOM will be involved in creating Data Technical Baseline (DTB) profiles specific for each program of record. DTBs may consist of interfaces, protocols, content, information quality, architectural aspects, and knowledge base frameworks. SYSCOMs will exercise technical authority to assess Program of Record compliance to DTBs and Key Performance Parameters in support of gate reviews and system engineering technical reviews."

Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) IW effort focuses prioritization and organizational responsibility for IW, cyber, intelligence and sensors resulting in increased scope of systems, platforms and mission areas. FORCEnet is a foundation of Sea Power 21, Naval Power 21, which is the Naval Operating Concept (NOC) for Joint Operations, and the DoN's Naval Transformation Roadmap.\n \nThe FORCEnet project line funds the following efforts: \n\n(1) IW Portfolio Health Assessment (PHA): Funding supports PHAs of Navy mission areas and identifies gaps in IW capabilities in the context of assessed mission areas. Funds support vignettes, technical baselines, architecture products, and briefings developed to support sponsor decision making processes.\n\n(2) The Chief of Naval Operations concurred with the Task Force Netted Navy recommendation to stand up the Digital Warfare Office (DWO) to set requirements, prioritize resources, and lead efforts on information interoperability and human\/machine teaming. \n\nNAVAIR, NAVSEA, SPAWAR, associated Program Executive Offices, warfare and system centers and University Affiliated Research Centers\/Federally Funded Research and Development Centers will support the Model Based Engineering, Technical Design, and Requirements branches in the new DWO under OPNAV N2N6. In order to develop capability from the top down, the DWO will develop requirements for the system of systems to include all of the associated interoperability requirements. Due to the complexity of this work, the DWO will evolve the traditional requirements development methodology to a model based systems engineering environment that will include associated model extensions, reports, views, configuration management, help desk support, and documentation.  This work will be completed by a series of teams, each focused on a separate threat domain, and made up of system modelers, fleet representatives, program of record representatives, architecture and interoperability experts, etc. The products generated by these teams will include data technical baselines for domain areas with individual profiles for each program of record, coordinated requirements recommendations, and potential areas for S&T and experimentation to fill gaps. The DWO will also  explore  emerging digital technologies including human\/machine teaming.\n\nEach SYSCOM will be involved in creating Data Technical Baseline (DTB) profiles specific for each program of record. DTBs may consist of interfaces, protocols, content, information quality, architectural aspects, and knowledge base frameworks. SYSCOMs will exercise technical authority to assess Program of Record compliance to DTBs and Key Performance Parameters in support of gate reviews and system engineering technical reviews."

Funding facilitates the experimentation and demonstration of priority technologies to ensure that planned capabilities are technologically feasible, affordable, and available to Soldiers. Benefits include the narrowing of capability gaps by developing capability documents and rapidly transitioning leader-approved capability requirements to the Army Acquisition System. In project CF1, CFT will conduct pre-Materiel Solution Analysis Phase experimentation and technical demonstrations to enable capability document development and improve the decision making for potential programs of record.\n\nThis investment supports the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) six modernization priorities."

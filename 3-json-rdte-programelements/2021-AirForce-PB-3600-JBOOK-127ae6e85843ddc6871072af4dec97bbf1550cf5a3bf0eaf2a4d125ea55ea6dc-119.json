SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $6.4B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities. In FY 2012, as an AF pilot initiative, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&M to RDT&E, AF funds.\n\nProgram Element 1206398F, Project: 664281 Space and Missile Systems Center - Major Headquarters  Activities (MHA) was established to improve overall performance, strengthen business operations, and achieve efficiencies, effectives and cost savings that can be transferred to higher priority needs. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. SMC is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop\nnew or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

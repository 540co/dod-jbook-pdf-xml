These include high energy laser, high power microwaves, and other unconventional weapon generation and transmission technologies, which can support a wide range of Air Force applications. The program develops a corresponding susceptibility, vulnerability, and lethality database for directed energy weapons. This program also develops laser-enabled atmospheric-compensated optical imaging for space situational awareness. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602601F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

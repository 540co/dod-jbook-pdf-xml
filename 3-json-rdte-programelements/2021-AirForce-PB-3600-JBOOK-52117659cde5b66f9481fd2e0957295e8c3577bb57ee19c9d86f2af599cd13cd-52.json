As requirements emerge, BACN will integrate new hardware and software capabilities that improve system performance, interoperability, availability and open mission system technologies. Efforts include, but are not limited to, expansion of external time reference capabilities, Survivability Urgent Operational Need (UON) Military Global Positioning System (GPS) and other system enhancements, development and integration of advanced antennas and waveforms, ground support capabilities and assimilation of mandates levied on the BACN systems. Survivability UON is required for BACN Fleet to fly in increasingly contested Area of Responsibility (AOR). Safety of flight considerations, including performance, aircraft structural integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements will be addressed.  Efforts will include required non-recurring engineering and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, the development of simulators\/trainers, development of training materials, and technical publications.\n\nExecute risk reduction activities for development of future capabilities on BACN payload\/aircraft efforts. \n\n\nBeginning in FY21, to support the divestiture of the EQ-4B (a variant of the RQ-4 Block 20\/30 aircraft) efforts will taper accordingly, to include BACN payload sustainment & other BACN specific efforts.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BACN weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

As requirements emerge, BACN will integrate new hardware and software capabilities that improve system performance, interoperability, availability and open mission system technologies. Efforts include, but are not limited to, expansion of external time reference capabilities, Survivability Urgent Operational Need (UON) Military Global Positioning System (GPS) and other system enhancements, development and integration of advanced antennas and waveforms, ground support capabilities and assimilation of mandates levied on the BACN systems. Survivability UON is required for BACN Fleet to fly in increasingly contested Area of Responsibility (AOR). Safety of flight considerations, including performance, aircraft structural integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements will be addressed.  Efforts will include required non-recurring engineering and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, the development of simulators\/trainers, development of training materials, and technical publications.\n\nExecute risk reduction activities for development of future capabilities on BACN payload\/aircraft efforts.\n\nBeginning in FY21, to support the divestiture of the EQ-4B (a variant of the RQ-4 Block 20\/30 aircraft) efforts will taper accordingly, to include BACN payload sustainment & other BACN specific efforts.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the BACN capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F"

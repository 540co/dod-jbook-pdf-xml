Currently the LAV Modification and Sustainment program will capture the ACAT IV(M) Obsolescence program (OB).  The OB program will address the Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) automotive system obsolescence and reduced performance due to increased Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW).  The OB program will improve fleet reliability and availability by addressing the three sub-systems (power pack, driveline and steering) that specifically account for 95% of total system downtime.  Also, fields a modern driver's instrument panel and LAV-25 Slip Ring.  This effort will require delivery of 8 kits (7 installed on vehicles, 1 stand-alone kit) during the Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to support Developmental Testing (DT), fielding, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products, Modification Instructions (MI) and Engineering Change Proposals (ECP)."

Physical integration, capability analysis, modeling and simulation, ergonomics, and usability assessments are facilitated by this program in working with the various program managers and project officers in the development of their unique items that contribute to the squads overall capabilities. MERS operates and manages the Gruntworks Squad Integration Facility, including facilities sustainment, restoration and modernization of the facility, to meet mission requirements in order to support integration and assessments of equipment.  MERS is engaging industry and academia in search of innovative technologies that can enhance infantry capabilities via a Partnership Intermediary Agreement. Weight and volume management are fundamental considerations in the insertion or modernization of any squad equipment. MERS works with Joint and NATO soldier modernization programs to harvest new technologies to increase the capability of the rifle squad. The program also ensures the integration of the rifle squad into the various mobility platforms currently in service and being developed to ensure a Marine and his equipment can operate effectively. This program is essential to ensure the combined synergistic equipment effects enhance the war-fighting functions of the Marine rifle squad towards the strategic Marine Corps war fighting vision for the future.\n\nAmmunition Life Cycle Management Program responsibility for Total Life Cycle Management for ground conventional munitions.  Accordingly, PM Ammo is a member of the joint services Ammunition Logistics Research and Development IPT (ALR&D IPT).  Each year the IPT solicits R&D projects from all of the services.  The IPT looks for innovative ideas to enhance logistical support for munitions.  Approximately 20 Ammo Logistics R&D projects are voted on each year by the IPT.  They are prioritized by voting actions of the Senior Review Board and funding sources are identified.  Since the funding for ammunition will likely decrease as the Marine Corps draws down and we end our participation in OEF, ammunition logistics R&D projects designed to extend the shelf life of our current inventory, provide enhanced packaging to protect our munitions, and other such projects will go a long way to ensure the Marine Corps can maintain a reliable conventional ammunition inventory into the future."

Using complex computer-simulated behavior models, MTWS provides an interactive, decision-based, real-time, war game representing the six war-fighting functional areas of fires, command and control, force protection, logistics, maneuver, and intelligence.  It's modeling breadth and flexibility enables users to represent and exercise a wide variety of combat scenarios to prepare leaders to face the military challenges of today's world.  MTWS is designed to support the training of commanders and their staffs in exercises involving live and simulated land, air, and naval forces at all operational command levels.  The system supports all levels of command throughout the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and Joint Task Force (JTF). MTWS can be used as a multi-sided war game, including red, blue, civilian, and non-aligned sides.  The system can also be used to validate specific operational plans against a variety of enemy and environmental situations.

Items approved for procurement will transition into Operation and Maintenance Marine Corps accounts for Infantry Combat Equipment, Family of Field Medical Equipment, Family of Shelters, and Combat Field Feeding Systems.  The benefits will be reduced logistics, less weight, improved combat effectiveness, better echelon I and II care for Marines, improved individual and unit protection, expeditionary feeding platforms, tactical mobility, etc.  The employment of state of the art equipment will ensure Marines are equipped and supported with the best items that technology can offer.\n\nThe Infantry Combat Equipment portfolio of capabilities encompasses Marine Corps Uniforms, Cold Weather and Mountaineering, Load Bearing and Pack Systems, and Individual Warfighting Equipment research, development and testing of enhancements, upgrades and modifications to legacy systems and new developments. Funding for this capability area leverages other Services' and governmental partners' efforts to maximize returns on investment and promote coordination and cooperation for same or similar requirements and capabilities. The objective is to equip individual Marines with uniforms and combat equipment to maximize effectiveness in every environment across the full range of military operations.     \n\nThe Family of Field Medical Equipment, Family of Shelters, and Combat Field Feeding System portfolio focus is to provide state of the art medical equipment (e.g. Authorized Medical Allowance List (AMAL)\/Authorized Dental Allowance List (ADAL), Enroute Care, Mobile Medical Monitors, etc.), Family of Shelters (soft wall, different frames and fabrics, etc.), and Combat Field Feeding Systems (technology insertion for the Expeditionary Field Kitchen (EFK), Modernized Tray Ration Heating System. etc.)."

The system includes one launcher, two Re-Supply Systems, and the MFOM. HIMARS will provide the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF)with 24 hour ground-based, responsive General Support\/General Support Reinforcing (GS\/GSR) indirect fires which accurately engage targets at long range (60+km), with high volumes of lethal fire under all weather conditions throughout all phases of combat operations ashore, to include irregular warfare and distributed operations. HIMARS is a significant improvement over previously fielded ground fire support systems. During a 24 hour period, the system is expected to conduct multiple moves and multiple fire missions. Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) is the primary munition for USMC units fielded with the HIMARS. GMLRS provides medium, and long range precision and area fires to destroy and\/or suppress threat forces. GMLRS integrates GPS guidance to achieve accuracy, requiring fewer rockets to defeat targets, and thus reduces the logistics burden.  \n\nHIMARS is a significant improvement over previously fielded ground fire support systems.  During a 24 hour period, the system is expected to conduct multiple moves and multiple fire missions.  Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) is the primary munition for units fielded with the HIMARS. GMLRS provides close, medium, and long range precision and area fires to destroy, suppress, and shape threat forces and protect friendly forces against cannon, mortar, rocket and missile artillery, light material and armor, personnel, command and control, and air defense surface targets.  GMLRS integrates guidance and control packages and an improved rocket motor achieving greater range and precision accuracy, requiring fewer rockets to defeat targets, thereby reducing the logistics burden. The GMLRS integrates a multi-mode fuse and high explosive warhead making it an all-weather, precision strike rocket.  The three GMLRS variants are GMLRS with Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM),  GMLRS Unitary (U), and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW).   GMLRS U expands the MLRS target set into urban and complex environments by adding point, proximity, and delay fusing modes.  GMLRS U have been fired in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), and has demonstrated high effectiveness and low collateral damage while supporting Marines in combat.  GMLRS AW was developed to replace  GMLRS-DPICM and meet the requirements outlined in a 25 June 2008 cluster munitions policy.\n\nHIMARS satisfies the Marine Corps requirement for an indirect fire system that is responsive, maneuverable, and is capable of engaging targets at long range.  The Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) includes training devices for tactical training, classroom training and handling exercises."

The U.S. Army HIMARS program received increased funding and is now an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC level program. Marine Corps Resupply System requirements are unique. Accordingly, the Marine Corps is an integrator and must ensure the required warfighting capability is fielded to the Marine Corps operating forces. The USMC has aligned funds to reflect an emphasis on not only hardware development, but also the integration of these principle end items while providing associated evaluation and oversight, and the development of associated rocket munitions in conjunction with the Army. Additionally, the Marine Corps program is establishing the training and support methodologies that will result in associated skill sets required within the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps strategy is incorporating acquisition and capability upgrades to both the systems and rocket munitions. These improvements parallel the U.S. Army's acquisition strategy."

These initiatives include but are not limited to the following: the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS), munitions development & testing (to Precision Extended Range Munition), as well as testing and development of the Family of Artillery Munitions (FAM), Common Laser Ranger Finder (CLRF) integrated capability, and the Modeled Meteorological Information Manager (MMIM).  \n\nEFSS is an all-weather, ground based indirect fire system designed to support the vertical assault element of the Ship-To-Objective Maneuver (STOM) force.  The EFSS is defined as a Launcher, Mobility Platform (prime mover), Ammunition, Ammunition Supply Vehicle, and Technical Fire Direction and Control equipment necessary for orienting weapons to an azimuth of fire.  EFSS supports irregular warfare and distributed operations.  FY17 will complete qualification. \n\nFAM funding is used to develop and mature artillery munitions for the Marine Corps triad of fire and includes conducting safety analysis and ship compatibility studies.   \n\nThe Modeled Meteorological Information Manager (MMIM) is the primary artillery meteorological capability at the artillery battalion and regiment providing the ability to create, receive, manage, and transmit near real time gridded meteorological information supporting artillery and target acquisition systems.  \n\nThe Fire Support Mod Line (FSML) is a set of Marine Corps efforts to address critical operational and logistics deficiencies in existing, fielded fire support\/weapons systems and equipment.  FSML provides technical refresh and development of target acquisition, artillery survey, meteorological systems, weapon systems, and fire direction control.  Funding is used to ensure Clinger Cohen Act (CCA) and Information Assurance (IA) requirements are met.  Provides execution of product improvements\/modifications, and upgrades to system hardware and software for the Ground Counter Fire Sensor (GCFS), Marine Artillery Survey Set (MASS), Modeled Meteorological Information Manager (MMIM), Global Positioning System Survey (GPS-S) and the Improved Position Azimuth Determining System (IPADS), Lightweight Target Designator (LTD), the Joint Terminal Attack Controller-Laser Target Designator (JTAC-LTD), and the Common Laser Range Finder (CLRF).  Funding is also used for upgrades, engineering change proposals (ECPs), and modifications for guided munitions and fire control systems which fall within Fire Support Systems for the Marine Corps.  \n\nThe Family of Internally Transportable Vehicles (FITV) are light weight and internally transportable in the V-22, CH-53D & CH53E helos. The FITV provide deployed Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) (MEU (SOC)) with vehicles that are internally transportable in selected rotary and fixed wing aircraft.  The FITV are expeditionary vehicles supporting over-the-horizon amphibious operations, irregular warfare and enhanced company operations.  It is then fielded to Reconnaissance, Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), and artillery batteries as part of the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS).  The FITV also provide Special Operations Forces (SOF) with platforms to support their primary and secondary missions.  Speed, maneuverability, and the use of cover and concealment are the crew's primary means of survival. In FY20 the Marine Corps will establish the Internally Transportable Vehicle Replacement (ITV-R) initiative. The ITV-R will replace the current Family of Internally Transportable Vehicles (FITV) and  Utility Task Vehicle (UTV). Research, testing and developmental efforts will begin in FY19 for the ITV-R. \n\nConventional Ground Ammunition is a project that identifies and develops Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technologies to address IM shortfalls in new Marine Corps development or improvements to legacy Conventional Ground Ammunition to meet OSD mandated IM compliance requirements.  These IM Technology investments directly support the development of the bi-annual Marine Corps Insensitive Munitions Strategic Plan (IMSP) to address the identified IM technology needs of the Marine Corps."

These IM Strategic Plans, Supporting Plan of Actions, and Milestones, with funding trial, are submitted to the JROC, demonstrating each Service's commitment to the continuing effort to improve IM characteristics of Conventional Ground Ammunition, for approval. In order to achieve the system's IM performance, the Conventional Ground Ammunition developer\/owner must have new technology identified and available to address IM shortfalls at the onset of the ammunition development or available for insertion during improvement opportunities for legacy ammunition.

Development will typically be conducted at government labs.  \n\nExpeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) and the Precision Extended Range Munition (PERM):  \nEFSS:  Support current readiness levels while developing the means of streamlining the acquisition of spare parts.  Continue to develop and procure digital equipment used to support Expeditionary Fire Control System (EFCS)and digitize the EFSS mortar line.\nPERM:  Finalize testing and procure the first option buy for PERM.  Conduct testing that supports EFCS development and fielding that will be conducted in coordination with PERM first options buy. \n\nFamily of Artillery Munitions (FAM): \nProgram includes four (4) artillery munitions which are being developed by the Army. The Army is the lead service for these programs but continues to interact with the FAM IPT to ensure USMC requirements and capability needs are met. This allows the USMC to become users of the munition and certify the round for naval transportation. The munitions include but are not limited to; XM1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK), M1122 and M1123 Infrared (IR) and M1124 Visual Light (VL) 155mm RAP Round. Each munitions' status is tracked to ensure Marine Corps requirements are satisfied throughout the systems lifecycle.  \n\nFire Support Mods:  \nDevelop an improved Acoustic Sensor capability by exploiting recent technology improvements in computation and networking to improve data fusion.  An early prototype is anticipated in FY19.  The improved acoustic sensor will be capable of transmitting digital information via JVMF to AFATDS in support of artillery and counter fire operations.  Initiate coordination between the Army's Armament, Research and Development Engineering Center (ARDEC), and MCSC's and NSWC DD science and technology efforts to commence development of the Future Survey System.  Continue liaison with the Army's PM TAS in order to leverage future efforts and increase the probability of a joint procurement. Initiate development of a MMIM communications reach back capability to allow for ingestion of meteorological data into artillery firing data for units deployed to austere locations with limited or no bandwidth communications.   Procure hardware and software refreshes for the GPSS, MASS and MMIM to ensure compliance with cybersecurity policies, address obsolescence and interoperability with other C2 systems.\n\n\nFamily of Internally Transportable Vehicles (FITV):\nThe FITV program strategy is to explore, research and recommend efforts to address and identify solutions to  reliability and safety design issues through government off-the-shelf (GOTS), commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified off-the-shelf (MOTS) components. This effort includes the Internally Transportable Vehicle Replacement (ITV-R) initiative which will begin to replace the current Family of Internally Transportable Vehicles (FITV) and  Utility Task Vehicle (UTV). \n\nConventional Ground Ammunition:\nThe Conventional Ground Ammunition strategy is to invest in Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies to address IM shortfalls of priority programs identified in the bi-annual Marine Corps Insensitive Munitions Strategic Plan (IMSP).  Once the IM technologies have been successfully demonstrated and matured, the intent is to insert the new technologies into new conventional ground ammunition development as well as provide opportunities to improve legacy munitions IM characteristics.  The IM R&D effort directly addresses the mandated OSD requirement to obtain incremental IM improvement in pursuit of becoming fully IM compliant to the maximum extent practicable."

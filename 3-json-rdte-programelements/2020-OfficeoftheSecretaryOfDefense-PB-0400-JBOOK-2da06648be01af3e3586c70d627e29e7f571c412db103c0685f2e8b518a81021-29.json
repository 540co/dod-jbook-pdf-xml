            "val": "This Program Element (PE) addresses Defense Research and Engineering priorities to advance engineering state of the practice, and complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including modeling and simulation (M&S), systems engineering (SE) research, and engineering capabilities for resilience, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems in support of the full range and scope of Department of Defense (DoD) missions and operations.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) addresses the National Defense Strategy priorities of increasing lethality, strengthening alliances and supporting Department business reform.  Engineering Science and Technology underpins improving department-wide practices of evaluating and improving the lethality of complex systems through modeling and simulation and engineering capabilities for resilience.  Improvements to the Department's systems engineering and simulation capabilities have a profound effect on ensuring that we are able to quickly and affordably field a lethal Joint Force by addressing the interwoven dependencies in system and mission capabilities, rapidly evolving technologies, lifecycle considerations, and resource limitations in the face of dynamic threats and changing missions.  In addition, these engineering and modeling and simulation practices cross international boundaries and is an area of collaboration with our Allies; it improves the way we are able to train as an allied force and operate together on the battlefield.\n\nM&S is a key enabler of DoD capabilities; underpins innovative solutions meeting real-world national security challenges and ensuring technical superiority; acts as a force multiplier; saves resources; and saves lives.  The DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO), designated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)) to be the focal point and advocate for DoD M&S, enhances the DoD M&S Enterprise by (1) enabling joint and cross-cutting cooperation and collaboration in identifying, developing and sustaining modeling and simulation solutions; and (2) promoting technology solutions, including common M&S architectures, standards, and services that improve interoperability, reuse, and cost effectiveness of DoD M&S.\n\nThe Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to conduct systems research and improve the Department\u2019s ability to develop and deploy complex weapon systems.  Greatly improved SE methods, processes and tools are essential to the DoD strategy to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, and ready to incorporate emerging technologies to address a full range of contingencies, in the face of constrained budgets and an aging workforce. The SERC consists of a network of 22 research universities from across the U.S. that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD\u2019s systems engineering research problems.\n\nEngineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for the faster design of cost- and mission-effective DoD warfighting systems by conducting research and development in computational engineering tools, system performance models, and data analysis techniques. From early design and testing through validation, fielding and sustainment, these tools and techniques give decision makers the information needed to make better-informed decisions and ensure Warfighter and mission success. A digital engineering initiative, ERS increases design agility by increasing design options across the lifecycle, leading to improvements in testing, manufacturing, fielding and sustainment of mission-effective and adaptable systems.  ERS uses an advanced science and technology driven approach to provide the following core capabilities: Set-Based Design (SBD), Computational Engineering and Large-Scale Data Analytics. With ERS, DoD is reducing risk in future systems development by using high-fidelity modeling and advanced analyses of design options, as well as linking candidate platforms to traditional modeling and simulation toolkits and employing DoD\u2019s high-performance computing assets."

Its products are engineering design visualization and tool integration frameworks which integrate physics-based models and engineering tools to vastly improve the ability to perform tradespace and requirements analysis, optimize designs and improve architectures.  These improved architectures will enable systems to more rapidly adapt to changing technologies and threats.  ERS uses advanced science and technology methods to provide the following core capabilities: Set-Based Design (SBD), Computational Engineering and Large-Scale Data Analytics. These engineering improvements will accelerate delivery of advanced capabilities to the warfighter and address a geopolitical environment marked by rapidly changing threats, tactics, missions and technologies, and fiscal constraints. The pace of change renders current point-design approaches unsustainable in both cost and time.  ERS methods and tools help engineers integrate advanced technologies into systems affordably, at the speed of relevance.\n\nERS research and development aims to transition practical applications to programs within the DoD, while continuing to evolve and develop future capabilities. ERS focuses on new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, models, simulations and related capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools with an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes. These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports transparency, inclusion and data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that provides advanced knowledge management, including data retention and lessons-learned, and enables multi-community collaboration. ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&T community to inform the acquisition decision process (e.g., increased\/easier use of High-Performance Computing, web-based analysis with large data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis).  These new computational and model-based frameworks adapt advanced design and modeling approaches from Government, industry, and academia to enable our Nation to affordably deliver warfighting capability at the speed of relevance. ERS provides the capability to fully explore and identify key performance parameters and inform the requirements process. With ERS, DoD is reducing risk of future systems development by using high-fidelity modeling and advanced analyses of design options, as well as linking candidate platforms to traditional modeling and simulation toolkits and employing DoD\u2019s high-performance computing assets. ERS leverages existing investments in surface and subsurface ships, aircraft, and ground vehicles, radio frequency, meshing and geometry models. Future domains, driven by Service requirements, may include future developments in Space, Hypersonics, Electronic Warfare and Directed Energy."

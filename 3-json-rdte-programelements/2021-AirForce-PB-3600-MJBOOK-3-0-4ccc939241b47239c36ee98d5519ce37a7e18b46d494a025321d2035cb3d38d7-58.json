These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.\n\nThere are four projects within this program element: Program and Budget Enterprise Services (PBES), Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM), Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1), and DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD), formally known as DEAMS Increment 2, prior to FY20.\n\nPBES is a software development effort that will utilize a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to deliver budgeting and programming capability for the Air Force and will replace legacy systems (Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS), and Enhanced Tradespace Tool (ETT) that support the budget formulation and force programming process.\n\nCEM is a knowledge-based study effort to improve Air Force-wide cost estimating by analyzing cost data and recommending changes to estimating models, methods, and tools.\n\nDEAMS development will be governed in Capability Support Phase after Increment 1 Full Deployment (FD).\n\nDEAMS is the Air Force's target core accounting and financial management solution and is a key component of the long-term business process improvements needed to sustain auditability and correct financial system weaknesses.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

PBES will replace legacy systems such as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES), Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and the Enhanced Tradespace Tool (ETT), supporting the budget formulation and force programming process. Upon full deployment of PBES, the system will be compliant with the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) conventions, which will enable data standardization across the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nUtilizing Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), the Air Force has designated PBES as the solution to deliver traceability of financial data in support of the PPBE process. Through the use of BPR, PBES will address excessive overhead, outdated business practices and other time-consuming support activities. PBES will make the budget formulation process more efficient by incorporating business best practices, organizing programming and budgeting personnel, as well as utilizing current technology. PBES will also eliminate checks and balances required of older technology, taking advantage of automated reconciliation services. In addition, the solution will allow the use of Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) for data exposure, resulting in more timely and accurate budget submissions to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Congress, and other internal and external customers.\n\nA Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product has been selected as the tool of choice which will require minor configuration changes to meet the stated user requirements. This strategy requires no code changes to the actual COTS product and will drive lower support costs along with making future requirements changes easier in the out-years.  Requirements will be satisfied through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced and made available to operational users after every sprint. The Integrated Product Office construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

The PBES strategy, supported by all Stakeholders, employed an empowered joint Program Office, Functional Community, and Senior Stakeholder group to rapidly develop, test, and deploy the Air Forces Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) capability within two years. This strategy required mutual trust and risk acceptance by all parties to be successful. Thus far, this strategy has been highly successful delivering PBES capabilities ahead of schedule and substantially under budget.  \n\nThe first step in this strategy utilized early risk reduction efforts (sometimes referred to as \"prototyping\u201d) to prove the capability and contractors existed to meet user's needs. This was conducted using two 6-month contract vehicles which were both completed months early, delivering several hundred user requirements. The success of these efforts led to the strategy of selecting a COTS product called Oracle Hyperion and to hire a small-business system integrator (SI). The significance in both of these is that the COTS product and the SI have both already been deployed across commercial companies and multiple DoD agencies, thus reducing the risk for implementation by the Government.\n\nBoth contract awards for the SI and Oracle licenses were made in 1QFY2018, with substantial cost savings received by negotiating bulk license purchases for all AF users. The development strategy employs agile development methods creating 4-6 week \"Sprint\u201d releases to deploy capability rapidly with substantial user feedback along the way. Fourteen total Sprints were planned across two years in an attempt to match on-going Air Force PPBE cycles. As Sprints are developed and tested, they are then deployed for operational use.\n\nMAJCOMs will first use PBES in October 2019, for their FY2022 POM development and then submit their budget requests up to the Air Staff for their review and creation of the Air Force FY2022 POM. Air Staff will primarily use PBES over the legacy system in April 2020, with continued use throughout the FY2022 POM cycle. In FY2018, the AF decided to accelerate the PBES Planning application, so AF Planners will first use PBES for the FY2022 Plan creation in Feb 2020.  While PBES will be continually updated throughout these two years, it is also the strategy to migrate all legacy system data into PBES in manageable packages across the two years.\n\nFull deployment of PBES is on schedule to be completed in 2QFY2021. The success of this strategy can be attributed to mutual buy-in by all parties, risk acceptance that the solution will not be perfect from the start, and an understanding that not all requirements are exactly known up-front and that changes will be required continuously to be successful."

In collaboration with the OSD Cost Assessment Data Enterprise (CADE) project (DoD's unified initiative to collect, organize, store, and use data more efficiently), these products will improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the acquisition program cost estimates required by statute (e.g., 10 USC 2366, 2433, 2434) and policy directives (e.g., DoDI 5000.02) in support of AF and DoD acquisition decisions, programming and execution decisions, and Congressional mandates.   \n\nCEM will ensure the Air Force continuously improves cost estimating capabilities for broad cross-cutting areas, as well as specific to each weapon system type (aircraft, UAVs, ballistic missiles, tactical missiles, munitions, electronics and aircraft modifications, ground stations and automated information systems, space and launch vehicles).  Changing technologies, acquisition laws, policy directives, and initiatives drive the need to revise cost estimating processes, methods, and tools.  For example, current capability shortfalls reflect gaps in the ability to respond effectively to the laws and regulations that drive increased cost estimating demands such as FY16\/17\/18 NDAA reports (PL 114-92\/114-328\/115-91--provisions relating to Major Defense Acquisition Programs (Section 804 of the FY16 NDAA authorized rapid prototyping and rapid fielding of defense systems), Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) (provisions related to improving cost estimating quality, especially earlier in the program life-cycle and affordability analysis), Secretary of the Air Force Acquisition Excellence Plan (priorities to improve cost estimating capability and affordability analysis and improved cost estimating support to requirements process), and Office of the Secretary of Defense policy (initiatives on enhanced trade-off analysis, affordability analysis, and will- versus should-cost analysis).  The CADE and CEM partnership is the lead example for better data initiatives designed as a response to Congressional expressed desire for better outcomes in acquisition.  The partnership provides data\/analysis\/methods\/tools and institutional knowledge at the analysts' fingertips versus the status quo inefficient, ad hoc approach.\n\nThis project will perform knowledge-based studies to include analyzing historical data and changing technologies\/programmatics to develop new estimating methods (e.g. statistical tools, cost estimating relationships) across hundreds of product work breakdown structure elements and functional cost elements within each weapon system type noted above.  Examples of areas of cost studies and modeling efforts that cut across all weapon system types are directed energy costs, software cost datasets and metrics; contract or engineering change order studies, analysis, and models; other government cost data, methods, and analysis tools (e.g., depot standup and government test); reliability and maintainability trends and impacts on cost; and fixed price contract performance.\n\nCEM will deliver valuable analytical tools in support of higher quality\/credible estimates (as required by statute and regulation) allowing for more realistic cost conscious decisions on over $100B of critical warfighter capability.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.  \n\nThe remaining DEAMS Increment 1 development activities will be completed using agile software development methodologies under a project called DEAMS Rapid Acquisition.  As a Section 873 Agile Pilot program, Rapid Acquisition will also be a stepping stone in the implementation of agile development methodologies for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD).  Under Rapid Acquisition, the program contracted with a new System Integrator (SI) to sustain the DEAMS R12 baseline, develop the remaining Inc. 1 requirements (disbursing, reporting, Governance\/Risk\/Compliance (GRC)), and provide continual enhancement and improvement to the deployed system, utilizing agile software development.\n\nDEAMS CCD capabilities will be implemented utilizing an agile software development methodology. Requirements for CCD include, but are not limited to, development of the core accounting and reporting functionality necessary to enable deployment of modernized personnel, contracting, and logistics systems. Additional capabilities under requirements definition include complex acquisition management, reimbursable cost accounting, military entitlement accounting, advanced accounting controls and audit sustainment, treasury cash accountability, and management accounting and billing for revolving funds. Included in these capabilities are selected requirements deferred from Increment 1. \n\nRequirements will be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced after every sprint. The PMO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.\n\nAdditional user deployments enabled by future increment capabilities include acquisition program executive offices; ranges, laboratories and test centers; and air logistics centers. These deployments will add an additional 4,600 users to the Inc 1 baseline for a total of 22,500 users.\n\nThis funding request will support development of the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) compliance information artifacts and plans necessary to support the program, Capability Process Maps (CPMs) for each business capability, and mapping of financial management processes the capability will require (Blueprinting). Additionally, the funding will support acquisition strategy planning by early identification\/definition of Information Technology Functional Requirements (ITFRs) and Information Assets (IA), Acquisition Strategy Determination, Solution Approach, and Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation. \n\nFunds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio\n- Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) (Incremental Deployments)\n- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs\n \nOn 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increment. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Inc 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Force in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (FD ATP) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. (FD ATP date is August 2020 and Capability Support Authority to Proceed (CS ATP) date is February 2021.)\n\nThe remaining DEAMS Inc 1 schedule includes the Oracle e-Business Suite R12 upgrade and development and deployment of the remaining Increment 1 capabilities (disbursing, reporting, and Governance\/Risk\/Compliance (GRC)), as well as enhancements and improvements to the existing baseline.  In accordance with the FY2019 NDAA, DEAMS is an Agile Pilot program as defined in Sec 873 of the FY2018 NDAA, and all remaining development will be accomplished using agile software development methodologies.\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 is developing capability which allows for deployment to the remaining user locations.  However, DEAMS has also begun transitioning the support of previously deployed locations to the Operation and Support (O&S) phase.\n\nFunds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document (CDD), Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision which do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity. The Army is projecting to start work on several AoAs beginning in FY 2018, and will assess and fund the highest Army priorities during the year of execution.\n\nFY 2018 funding in the amount of $9.832 million supports of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for new start programs that do not yet have a Program Manager assigned."

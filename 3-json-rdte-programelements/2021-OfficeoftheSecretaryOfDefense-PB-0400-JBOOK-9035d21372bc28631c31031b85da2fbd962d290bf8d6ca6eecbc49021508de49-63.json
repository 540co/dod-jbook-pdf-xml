The NC3 Portfolio consists of ~200 systems, platforms, networks, and applications.  The goals of the CPM are to 1) Accelerate NC3 modernization programs to deliver integrated cost-effective capabilities, 2) Maintain the readiness of operational NC3 systems and 3) Increase technology upgrades and prototyping to enable the future capabilities to outpace the threat.  This program will develop the necessary tools and processes to assess integrated programmatic risk and to manage and oversee NC3 modernization and sustainment efforts. These tools include software, analytical expertise, and information storage and retrieval systems to support the continuing development of CPM for managing the complex NC3 enterprise.  These efforts will simultaneously support the Commander, USSTRATCOM as NC3 Enterprise Lead and through the Director of the NC3 Enterprise Center (NEC); systems engineering and architecture development entities; the Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Research and Engineering (R&E), the Joint Staff, and the Services.  This program supports the capability portfolio-based approach (DoD Directive 7045.02, \u201cCapability Portfolio Management\u201d).  \n\nThis program funds development of new tools, technical assessment and planning for the CPM to manage the NC3 enterprise.  This includes: \n1) developing and deploying software tools for improving NC3 enterprise-level management and programmatic risk assessment; \n2) serving as the office of primary responsibility for NC3 enterprise capability portfolio management (to include assessing current capability, complying with statutory mandates, and conducting NC3-related studies, analysis, and policy updates); \n3) assessing DoD Component plans, programs, and budgets for adequacy and execution (including course of action development and recommendations); \n4) identifying, prototyping, evaluating, and recommending new technology for inclusion in the NC3 system; \n5) supporting development of NC3 architecture updates and modernization aimed at system improvements;\n6) developing NC3 corrective action and risk mitigation plans supported by senior investment decisions.\n."

It also provides the technical expertise to support risk management analysis (with an emphasis on system design, development and acquisition) of the NC3 enterprise and will develop strategies for synchronizing NC3 preplanned improvements.  It will support the timely exchange of program and capability status information between elements of the NC3 enterprise, the OSD staff, and the combatant commands with a goal of increasing the use of electronic means to provide current and accurate information on key elements of the NC3 enterprise.  \n\nThe effort will develop robust, integrated capability plans and schedules for NC3 capabilities to clarify system dependencies and identify disconnects.  It will also support cross-department collaboration for development of enterprise-wide approaches for capability management.  This includes: (1) vertical and horizontal integration activities within the Department and with the interagency where appropriate; (2) a coordinated portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; (3) reform efforts at the legislative, governance, policy, management and execution levels; 4) protection of information and technology that support or enables technology-based capability development for the NC3 warfighting domain and 5) supports the identification, evaluation, and incorporation of promising technology for inclusion in the NC3 system."

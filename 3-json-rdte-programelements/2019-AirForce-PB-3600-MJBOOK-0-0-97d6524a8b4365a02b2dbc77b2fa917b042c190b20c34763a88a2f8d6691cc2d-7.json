            "val": "This program develops the technology base for Air Force aerospace sensors and electronic combat. Advances in aerospace sensors are required to increase combat effectiveness by providing anytime, anywhere surveillance, reconnaissance, precision targeting, and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities. To achieve this progress, this program pursues simultaneous advances in: 1) generating, controlling, receiving, and processing electronic and photonic signals for radio frequency (RF) sensor aerospace applications; 2) electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) aerospace sensor technologies for a variety of offensive and defensive uses; 3) RF antennas and associated electronics for airborne and space surveillance, together with active and passive EO\/IR sensors; 4) technologies to manage and fuse on-board sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness; 5) technology for affordable, trusted, and reliable, all-weather surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike RF sensors and electronic combat systems; and 6) technologies that aid in the discovery and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities in avionics systems. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602601F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

The enabling technologies developed under this project will be used for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, EW, battlespace access, and precision engagement capabilities. The technologies developed include exploratory electronic and optoelectronic devices, components, microsystems and subsystems.  \n\nThis project also assesses designs, develops, fabricates, and demonstrates the associated technologies for integrating combinations of these component technologies. The project aims to demonstrate significantly smaller size, lower weight, lower cost, lower power dissipation, higher reliability, trustworthiness and improved performance. The device and subsystem technology developments under this project are military unique; they are based on Air Force and other Department of Defense weapon systems requirements in the areas of radar, communications, EW, navigation, and smart weapons."

Related efforts include improvements in avionics integration, digital processing, analysis tools, and sensor architectures.  One of the project's main goals is to improve EO and related technologies for the detection, tracking, and identification of non-cooperative and difficult targets, such as those obscured by camouflage or acquired at great range.  This project also develops the passive and active imaging sensors and algorithms needed to enable precision targeting in severe weather. These technologies are critical to future aerospace surveillance and targeting.  Other project goals include advanced EO threat warning and countermeasures."

First, this project improves our understanding of avionics cyber vulnerabilities by investigating the fundamental nature of avionics vulnerabilities including: how they come about, how they can be discovered, how they can be quantified and categorized, how they can be exploited, and how they can be removed or mitigated to secure the system. Second, this project aims to develop adaptable and resilient hardware\/software for real-time avionics cyber-attack pattern recognition and develop a protection system with the capability for autonomous learning, adaptation, and self-protection. Lastly, this project investigates open architecture concepts and technologies to deliver capability flexibility to Air Force avionics and weapon systems. These technologies are matured via integrated capability demonstrations."

The project emphasizes finding reduced signature targets and targets of opportunity.  It will enable new covert tactics for successful air-to-air and air-to-surface strikes.  This project also develops the technologies required to create trusted autonomic, distributed, collaborative, and self-organizing sensor systems that provide anticipatory  intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, situational awareness, and decision support for multi-layered sensing.  This program provides the technologies for:  1) trusted sensors and trusted sensor systems that will deter reverse engineering and exploitation of our critical hardware and software technology and impede unwanted technology transfer, alteration of system capability, and prevent the development of countermeasures to United States systems; 2) collaborative tasking of our own distributed heterogeneous sensor networks across a region and co-opted tasking of both traditional and non-traditional adversary sensors; 3) secure sensor web backbone technologies, sensor web physical topologies, and related protocols to assure reliable trusted sensor interactions; and 4) defining architectures for distributed trusted collaborative heterogeneous sensor systems and semantic sensor networks, developing new methodologies for system of systems sensor engineering and analysis, and new techniques for sensor network situation awareness and predictive analytics."

This project also develops and evaluates technology for ISR sensors, fire control radars, electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and offensive information operations systems.  It emphasizes the detection and tracking of surface and airborne targets with radio frequency signatures that are difficult to detect due to reduced radar cross sections, concealment and camouflage measures, severe clutter, or heavy jamming.  Techniques exploited include the use of multiple radio frequency phenomenologies, multi-dimensional adaptive processing, advanced waveforms and knowledge-aided processing techniques. This project also develops concepts to counter threats to our aerospace systems. It develops and evaluates technology for electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and electro-optical\/infrared seeker defeat. This project develops the radio frequency warning and countermeasure technology for advanced electronic warfare and information operations applications. The project also explores technologies to maintain a military advantage in position navigation and timing integrity, accuracy, and resiliency."

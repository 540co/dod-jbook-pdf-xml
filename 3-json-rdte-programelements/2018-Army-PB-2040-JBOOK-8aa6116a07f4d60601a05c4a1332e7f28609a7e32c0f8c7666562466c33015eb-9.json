As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusions are likely for aircraft not properly equipped. Upgrade of communication and aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy. This budget line will also provide funding for studies, evaluations and Analysis of Alternatives to support emerging Army fixed wing requirements for product improvements to support the FW fleet.\n\nIn accordance with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Working Oversight List (dated 26 Jun 15), the Fixed Wing Utility Aircraft (FUA) Program will be required to undergo both Live Fire Testing and Operational Testing.

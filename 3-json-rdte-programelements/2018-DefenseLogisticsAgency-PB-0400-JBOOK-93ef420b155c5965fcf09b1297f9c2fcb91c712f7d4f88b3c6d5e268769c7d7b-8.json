It requires supply chain excellence.  Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe, requires that DLA-managed materiel flows seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.\n\nDLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit innovative technical applications of existing technologies to solve current and future agency requirements.  Proposals from the small business community will fulfill this requirement.  All selections shall demonstrate and involve a reasonable degree of technical risk with yet to be determined technical feasibility.  Phase I proposals should demonstrate feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit supporting a Phase II award. Direct impact on a DLA solution, future market possibilities and demonstrated commercialization potential have a strong influence on Phase II selections."

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) needs.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products.  DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.\n\nThe Defense Logistics Agency's SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within several DLA Elements:\n\nDLA J3 R&D\n- Additive Manufacturing\n- Advanced Battery Manufacturing\n- Advanced Aircraft Braking Systems\n- Anti-Counterfeiting\n- Medical 3D Printing\n- Seamless Fuel Bladders\n- Strategic Materials\n- Warehouse Modernization\n- Subsistence\n- Limited Source NSN List (Source Approval Request (SAR) Development)\n- Reverse Engineering Technical Data Packages\n\n\nDMEA\n- Advanced microelectronics concepts, technologies, and applications."

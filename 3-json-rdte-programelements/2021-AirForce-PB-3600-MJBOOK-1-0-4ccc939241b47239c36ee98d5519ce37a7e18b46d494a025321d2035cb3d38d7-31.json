CON-IT will consolidate all contract writing, management, and reporting capabilities, as well as provide interoperability across all contracting communities (base operations, logistics, contingency, research and development, and weapons systems).  As of FY19, CON-IT has replaced Standard Procurement System, and will replace O'Contrax, ConWrite, and Automated Contract Preparation System, as well as six supporting systems.  \n\nCON-IT allows for a standardized and integrated method of anticipating and responding to the changing pace and dynamic nature of processes, regulations, and technologies across the contracting domain.   CON-IT also empowers the contracting community to fully support compliance with financial auditability and Financial Improvement Audit Readiness goals that depend on the integrity of the data flow through the Procure to Pay process.\n\nCON-IT capabilities are developed, deployed, and enhanced under an agile software development method, enabling strategic sourcing and other acquisition efficiencies by standardizing data, business rules, and milestone tracking.  The CON-IT Integrated Program Office's (IPO) agile framework allows for gap requirements to be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, after which usable capability is produced and deployed to operational users.  The IPO construct, along with application of an agile framework, allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, mitigate risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve processes.\n\nCON-IT's configuration baseline is built upon the Defense Information Systems Agency's Integrated Defense Enterprise Acquisition System contract writing system, a Government-off-the-Shelf product running on a Commercial Off-the-Shelf platform, Appian Business Process Management.  Through an interagency agreement, the CON-IT IPO partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Enterprise Application Services (EAS) team to develop, test, validate, deploy, and maintain CON-IT.  Data Center Hosting Services, managed and operated by the Digital Infrastructure Services Center, provides and maintains the development and production environments in the USDA Enterprise Data Centers.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver contract management system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 825, amendment to Public Law 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Section 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2020 AF penalty total is $50.0M The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nFunds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The CON-IT IPO established early user engagement through a series of subject matter expert familiarization events, in which system capabilities produced from each sprint cycle are tested by operational contracting officers (COs) and valuable user feedback is collected and incorporated into the program's requirements backlog. In FY 2018, the CON-IT IPO achieved Early Operational Capability (EOC) with initial deployment of CON-IT capabilities to 12th AF and subsequent EOC deployment to eight additional operational locations across the AF in every Major Command, except United States Air Forces in Europe.  In FY 2019, CON-IT was deployed AF-wide across 96 sites globally, and supported more than 3,500 contracting specialists and contracting officers (COs), resulting in more than 44,000 contract actions awarded.  CON-IT successfully subsumed Standard Procurement System (SPS), resulting in sun setting SPS 26 months ahead of schedule, and delivered a Business Intelligence Pilot for contracting data analytics.  CON-IT successfully supported two Air Force (AF) Pitch Days, resulting in more than 610 contracts and ~$200M.  Thus far in FY 2020, CON-IT is supporting more than 5,300 contracting specialists and COs, and has awarded more than 55,000 contracting actions.  CON-IT successfully supported two AF Pitch Days, resulting in more than 350 contracts and ~$28M.\n\nCON-IT's accomplishments have resulted in other Department of Defense and federal agencies seeking information about migrating to CON-IT as their contract writing and management solution.  Some agencies have made requests to start the migration process."

This agreement is renewed each year and contains a high-level outline of the highest priority requirements and epics to be addressed during the timeframe of the agreement.\n\nThe CON-IT roadmap includes five major capabilities. Capability 1 modernizes contract writing for base-level and operational users, allowing the Air Force's Standard Procurement System and AFCENTs' O'Contrax to sunset as sites transition to CON-IT.  Capability 2 deploys the same capability to meet the unique needs of the Weapon Systems, Research & Development, and Logistics communities, which will result in sunsetting ConWrite and Automated Contract Preparation System. Capability 3 and Capability 4 automate pre\/post award activities for the unclassified user base from Capability 1 and Capability 2. Capability 5 implements Capability 1, Capability 2, Capability 3, and Capability 4 for classified users.\n\nCON-IT is aligned to Office of the Secretary of Defense's (OSD's) Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy strategy for procurement systems. The program is re-engineering and automating the entire business process, implementing data standards set by OSD across the community, consolidating 10 legacy systems into one, reusing Government-off-the-Shelf solutions versus creating a new solution, and employing agile software development methods (a best practice from industry)."

Marine Expeditionary Forces will employ the SMAW MOD 2 across the spectrum of conflict, under all environmental conditions, to destroy a variety of ground targets. As defined in the FOTS Capability Production Document (CPD), the program consists of requirements for a new Launcher and integrated laser range finder and thermal sight. The Launcher will be physically and functionally compatible with existing inventory of SMAW rocket variants [High Explosive Dual Purpose, Anti-Armor, Novel Explosive and Common Practice (CP)] and will replace the existing Mark 153 Mod 0 SMAW launcher.  R&D supports the work being performed to develop new propellant technologies for an enhanced rocket motor as well as development of the SMAW Mod 2 replacement millijoule meter and replacement bore sight kit development."

CAPE accomplishes this by leading wargaming activities, developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near- to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.

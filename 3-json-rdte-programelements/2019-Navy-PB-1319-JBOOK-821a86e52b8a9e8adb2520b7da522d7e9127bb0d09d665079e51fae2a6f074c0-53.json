The Plan targets potential industry-wide technology and process solutions which are vetted by industry experts and builds upon the progress\nmade over the previous years. The collaboration's organizational structure promotes teaming of industry, government and academia to achieve the continuous product and process improvements necessary for improved Navy ship affordability.  Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-wide initiatives with aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards. Navy PEOs (Ships, Subs and Carriers) and NAVSEA are directly involved in NSRP.  The Plan calls for matching government and industry investments over several years."

AST is an innovative approach to leverage public\/private cooperation and target technology and process solutions that build on progress made over the previous years.  Funding ensures widespread adoption of innovative improvements, enhancing proficiency and productivity of the  public naval shipyard workforce to achieve the continuous product and process improvements necessary for improved Navy ship repair costs, and an overall reduction in availability duration."

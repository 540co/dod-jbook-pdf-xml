            "val": "This Budget Activity includes research, development, testing and evaluation management support for the Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).\n\nProgram Element 0605384BP supports Joint Doctrine and Training (Project DT6), sustains the technical test capability at West Desert Test Center (WDTC) (Project DW6); sustains the core Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) laboratory infrastructure (Project LS6), provides for program management and financial management support (Project MS6), and supports the Joint Concepts, Studies, and Analysis (JCSA) program (Project O49).  \n\nThe Joint Training and Doctrine Support (DT6) project supports the development of Joint Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for developing CB defense systems.  This project also supports CB modeling and simulation to support the Warfighter.\n\nThe Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) is a set of test installations, facilities, and ranges which are regarded as \"national assets\".  These assets are sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation missions.  However, the MRTFB facilities and ranges are also available to commercial and other users on a reimbursable basis.  WDTC is designated as the primary element of the MRTFB to primarily conduct CB Defense test and evaluation.  The DW6 Project provides operating support to WDTC and BTB-ECBC, also part of the MRTFB, to ensure that DoD test customers are only charged direct costs of testing and that overhead expenses are centrally funded.  It finances the required institutional test operating costs.  Institutional test operating costs include institutional civilian and contractor labor; repair and maintenance of test instrumentation, equipment, and facilities; and replacement of test equipment.\n\nThe Laboratory Support (LS6) project includes laboratory infrastructure to maintain and enhance DoD infrastructure capabilities to counter an expanding threat space, exploit advances in technology; and develop and transition CB defense equipment and countermeasures to the Warfighter.\n\nThe management support (MS6) project, provides management support for the DoD CBDP to allow program overview and integration of overall medical and non-medical programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)), through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical Biological Defense Programs (DATSD(CBD)); funds management by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); Development, coordination, and approval of joint CBRND requirements, management of multi-service and joint CBRND doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures; training, leader development, education, exercises, and development of the CBDP Program Objective Memorandum (POM) by the Joint Requirements Office; Joint RDA planning, input to the Annual Report to Congress and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO); review of Joint plans and the consolidated CB Defense POM Strategy by Army in its Executive Agent role.  \n\nThe management support project also includes the Test and Evaluation (T&E) Executive mission to establish test infrastructure investment strategy and adequate testing for Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical Biological Defense (CBD) systems and components throughout the systems' acquisition life cycle, as required in the RDA Plan under the Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program.  The JTIWG program includes T&E Early Involvement, test threat planning, Fielded Equipment Assessments, T&E studies, and T&E Standards planning and development to support testing the CBD systems for all services to include radiological, nuclear, medical T&E efforts.  \n\nThe Joint Concepts, Studies, and Analysis (JCSA) program (Project O49) project supports the planning, conduct, evaluation, and reporting on Joint tests (for other than developmental hardware) and accomplishment of operational research assessments in support of requirements received from the Services and the Combatant Commanders for already fielded equipment and systems.\n\nThis Budget Activity also provides for Program Element 0605502BP, which supports the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program.  The overall objective of the CBD SBIR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a CB environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include CB detection; information assessment (identification, modeling, and intelligence); contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment."

Project provides overhead (institutional) funding required to operate WDTC and BTB-ECBC in compliance with Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY03 (Public Law 107-314 - December 2002).\n\nWDTC and BTB-ECBC are the reliance center for all DoD CB defense testing and provide the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) test facility. Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the OSD Chemical and Biological Defense Program IAW Program Budget Decision 250 (1996).\n\nWDTC and BTB-ECBC use state-of-the-art chemical and life sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, equipment, and non-materiel CB defense solutions while maintaining safety, security, and surety of chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides test ranges, to include fully instrumented outdoor ranges, for TTPD activities and testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents to ensure reliable and repeatable data is generated to support acquisition decisions of CB defense equipment.\n\nSecretary of the Army has been directed to conduct additional research addressing existing gaps in scientific knowledge encompassing the Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Program. The transition of the Bio-Test Branch (BTB) to Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) will enable the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program to meet end to end enterprise tracking, reporting, and auditability requirements within an approved Governance, Risks, and Compliance framework.  The laboratory commanders and directors are best able to identify potential risk through the use of local risk assessments and are responsible to promote cultures of safety and responsibility.  Direct liaison with and oversight by the EA-RO will ensure laboratory directors or MRTFB commander are empowered and supported in their operational environment.  The ultimate responsibility for the safe and secure receipt, storage, handling, shipment and transfer of BSAT resides with the laboratory director or MRTFB commander in accordance with Army, Navy, Air Force, and Federal policies and regulations.  The implementation of a structured BSAT Biosafety Program includes clear standards and procedures, policy and regulations, peer review, quality control, accountability and oversight, adequate resources and infrastructure, and continuous process improvement.  Through these means employees and members of the public are protected against the hazards associated with BSAT."

                            "val": "This project provides management support for the DoD Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).  It includes program oversight and integration of overall non-CBRN Defense Equipment (non-CDE) and CBRN Defense Equipment (CDE) programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)) and defense programs through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical and Biological Defense (DASD(CBD)).  Funds execution management is provided by DTRA. \n\nThe project also provides for the development, coordination and integration of Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defense capability requirements, including assistance and support to the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Services to improve CBRN defense related doctrine, education, training, and awareness by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO); preparation of Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) documents in accordance with Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction CJCSI 3170.01I dated 23 January 2015; Joint CBRN Defense Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) planning; input to the CBD Annual Report to Congress; and program guidance development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO).\n\nThe Biological Select Agent and Toxin (BSAT) Biosafety Program Office (BBPO) will advise the Executive Agent Responsible Official (EA RO) for the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program on biosafety and all matters that pertain to risk associated with BSAT operations, provide oversight of DoD BSAT laboratory biosafety operations, serve as a unified DoD interface with external regulatory agencies, ensure safety and standardization of procedures used in DoD BSAT laboratories, and identify industry-wide best practices to enhance biosafety across the full spectrum of DoD BSAT operations.  As the EA RO for BSAT the program is tasked with technical review, inspection, and harmonization of biosafety protocols and procedures across DoD laboratories that handle BSAT. As such, the program manages the Biosafety and Scientific Review Panel, inspection of DoD laboratories, harmonization of DoD BSAT-related regulations and procedures, coordinating interaction and information with the CDC, establishing a Defense Business System to track and manage BSAT across DoD, providing laboratory biosafety oversight, and advancing BSAT-related scientific research to address knowledge gaps.  This office was established in March 2016 and prior to FY 2018 is funded within the OSD Management line.\n\nThe project includes programming support for the Joint Service CB Information System (JSCBIS) which serves as a budgetary and informational database for the DoD CBDP.  Also included within the project is financial management services to include fund distribution, execution reporting, and fiscal financial statements.\n\nThis project also supports the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (CBRND) Test and Evaluation (T&E) Executive, who is responsible for the planning, balancing, and oversight of test infrastructure and test technology requirements to support Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of DoD CBRND systems, as outlined in the RDA Plan.  The CBRND T&E Executive oversees the Enterprise processes to develop and sustain standardized T&E methodologies and validated instrumentation and infrastructure to ensure the adequacy of test for CBRND systems in alignment with acquisition milestones and associated decision points.  The Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program supports T&E Early Involvement; test threat planning; T&E studies; and T&E standards planning and development to support CBRND testing for all Services to include medical T&E efforts.  \n\nThe CBRND T&E Executive directly supports OSD T&E oversight of acquisition programs and provides the mechanism for early T&E involvement in the acquisition process.  The CBRND T&E Executive provides the T&E infrastructure investment strategy and coordinates investment planning and T&E capabilities validation among the Joint Service Community to ensure that program needs are met.  The CBRND T&E Executive oversees the T&E processes to ensure end to end feedback loops to support to the Warfighter."

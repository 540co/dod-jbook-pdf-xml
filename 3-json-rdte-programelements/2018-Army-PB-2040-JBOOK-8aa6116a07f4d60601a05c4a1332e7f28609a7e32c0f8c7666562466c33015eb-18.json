            "val": "This program element provides development for fire support command and control systems used by all Services from platoon to echelons above Corps.  There are two developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently FY18 and beyond:  Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment II) (project code EF7) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment I) (project code EF8).  The development on the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6) will be completed in FY17.\n\nJoint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. \n\nPocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD. \n\nAFATDS 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS program currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army\u2019s Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction."

Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY2015, this software application transitioned to PM Mission Command to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PFED Increment II will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PFED Increment II software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.\n\nPM Mission Command will continue to manage future capability blocks of software development. PM Mission Command will continue to coordinate with PM Soldier Warrior to field and train future versions of the software, as described above."

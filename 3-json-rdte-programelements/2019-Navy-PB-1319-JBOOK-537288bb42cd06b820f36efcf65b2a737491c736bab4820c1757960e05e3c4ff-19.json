They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nActivities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications\/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated acquisition program of record.\n\na) Advanced EW Enabling Technologies - Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. \n\nb) Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command & Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20) - Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 reflects the realignment of the EMC2 Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) designated program to PE 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Advanced Technology Development where all of the INP\/LA-Tech investments are being consolidated.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

It will benefit the warfighter by providing platform protection across the battlespace against many sensors, creating seamless cross-domain countermeasure coordination, and enabling rapid advanced technology\/capability insertion to counter emerging threats. \n\na) Develop reconfigurable and modular EW payloads, Distributed Decoy and Jammer Swarms (DDJS), effective multi-spectral countermeasures (CM), and Multiple Input\/Multiple Output Sensor\/CM (MIMO S\/CM) for platform protection across operational domains.\n\nThis R2 activity was initiated in PE 0602271N Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research and expanded in FY 2015 to PE 0603271N Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology."

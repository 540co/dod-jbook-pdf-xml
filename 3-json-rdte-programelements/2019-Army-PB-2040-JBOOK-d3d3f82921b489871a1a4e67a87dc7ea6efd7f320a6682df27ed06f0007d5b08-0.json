            "val": "Project 093.  The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers. This project funds software development for the MLRS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nFY2019 Base funding in the amount of $4.947 million for project 093 supports the continued software development of an organic tactical software build in support of the Fire Control System (FCS) hardware supporting both the current MLRS Fleet (upon upgrade with a modern hardware FCS) and the Army's MLRS Fleet Expansion effort. This software development leverages the program's completed software transition from the prime contractor to the government in FY2016. This FCS solution will be ready to field in FY2021. The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and will be the first release of organic software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher in FY2021.\n\nProject 789. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rocket (LCRRPR) is the only live training rocket for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and M270\/M270A1 MLRS Launcher units\/crews. LCRRPR meets a critical validated requirement for Active and National Guard HIMARS and M270A1 launcher units to achieve and maintain combat readiness. HIMARS and M270A1 Battalions are organic and attached to modular Fires Brigades supporting Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint Expeditionary Force, and Joint Special Operations Force combatant commanders. The training rocket has an inert payload section and blunt nose for inducing reduced range for use at multiple facilities in the United States and foreign countries. LCRRPRs are manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas and Letterkenny Munitions Center (LEMC) in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. LEMC provides an organic dual source.  The LCRRPR is currently produced by reusing the M26 pod and rocket motor, however, the US Government will soon experience inventory depletion of M26 rocket motors and Launch Pod Containers that feed the LCRRPR production line.\n\nProject DX8.  The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nFY2019 Base funding in the amount of $3.939 million for project DX8 supports HIMARS-unique software build, version 8.2. The Product Manager will field this software to the M142 fleet in FY2019. In addition to addressing software maintenance, software version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade."

These efforts are funded via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).  Emerging requirements include updates to address emerging threats of the launcher organic version 8.x software, reacting to system changes driven by policy and emerging requirements, and maintaining architectural compatibility. Communication suite changes, munitions updates, and introduction of new munitions require software and\/or hardware updates to ensure full compatibility and maintain operational viability.  The enduring organic v8.2 software effort is projected for Materiel Release and fielding to the M270A2 (MLRS) launcher when upgraded with the Fire Control System solution."

The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nFY2019 Base funding in the amount of $3.939 for project DX8 supports development of HIMARS-unique software build, version 8.2. In addition to addressing software maintenance, software version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade."

The Army completed transition from the prime contractor (legacy v7.x) to an organic approach organic (government developed, maintained, and owned) approach (v8.x forward)) by utilizing the Aviation & Missile Research & Development Engineering Center's (AMRDEC) Software Engineering Directorate (SED) as both the software developer and maintainer. These efforts are funded via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).  Emerging requirements include updates to address emerging threats of the launcher organic version 8.x software, reacting to system changes driven by policy and emerging requirements, and maintaining architectural compatibility. Communication suite changes, munitions updates, and introduction of new munitions require software and\/or hardware updates to ensure full compatibility and maintain operational viability.  The enduring organic version 8 software effort is projected for Materiel Release and fielding to HIMARS fleet in FY2019. When fielded, Version 8.2 will enable portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) launcher when upgraded with the Common Fire Control System solution."

            "val": "The Tactical Data Networks Enterprise (TDNE) develops, enhances and fields Tactical Data Links (TDL), advanced waveforms, radios, network management tools, and associated hardware and software that comprise the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN). This will be accomplished by upgrading currently fielded communications and TDL systems and by developing and fielding more advanced systems in the future. Also addresses warfighter urgent demands through the establishment of Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC) and Enterprise activities as directed by JALN council. TDNE supports the development, fielding and training of aerial layer networking capabilities across multiple core functions including air superiority, ground precision attack, command and control, space operations, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and personal recovery. These activities provide the Joint Forces Air Component Commander with networks to build a common operating picture of the battlespace. TDNE executes quick reaction response capability requests by the warfighter and support activities (including ramp-up) associated with the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) Enterprise activities as directed by the JALN Council. This program ensures the continued enhanced interoperability of Air Force and joint\/coalition\/NATO assets through efforts such as early systems engineering and use of the Political, Operational, Economic and Technical (POET) process for program requirements analysis and architectural design development\/coordination of all TDN standards and management capabilities, configuration management, platform\/ system interoperability assessments, development of government reference architectures, interoperability certification testing, and flight testing. PTW is a waveform designed to mitigate the effects of advanced jamming in Anti-Access\/Area Denial environments.  PTW provides worldwide, beyond line of sight, Anti-Jam (AJ), Low Probability of Intercept communications, via military and commercial satellite systems for tactical users in all Services. This effort funds Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem development and aperture development on suitable platforms like (but not limited to) RQ-4 and BACN.  PTW provides communication path diversity by increasing SATCOM resilience through satellite, spectral, and waveform diversity. This effort continues work started in Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration (PTSFD) to complete PTW maturity and modem development, leveraging TALON Tacet Avis aperture work to develop the PTW antenna and radome.  It includes terminal certification efforts (Information Assurance (IA), NSA and MIL-STD). This effort funds continued development of PTW components, protected tactical terminal modems that will be capable of being fully integrated into existing wideband terminals and will ensure delivery of protected tactical SATCOM to the joint and coalition warfighters in contested, degraded environments. PTW development activities may also include technical and acquisition-related studies, analysis, early systems engineering and risk reduction activities, addressing all subsystems to support both current program planning\/execution and future AF program planning.\n\n\nTDL System Integration will provide for the study (acquisitions current and proposed), analysis, enhancement, development, integration, demonstration, test, and evaluation of Tactical Data Links (TDLs) as a subset of the broader aerial layer networks. TDLs are used in both peace time and combat environments to exchange information such as character-oriented and fixed-formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free-text messaging and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when training or fighting under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs increase mission effectiveness by providing enhanced air domain situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, fusion\/correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, digital sharing of machine-to-machine target and threat information, thereby, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. TDLs are used by all service theater command and control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Link 22, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Variable Message Format (VMF), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and other Advanced TDL Link technologies, such as Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Common Data Link (CDL), and Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL). TDLs typically include both a waveform specification as well as the standards for exchanging messages. Agile Communications include the capability to share tactically significant information within\/to\/from highly contested environments in support of the Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan. Agile Communication efforts provide for pre-Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and development activities. High Capacity Backbone (HCB), a subset of the overall JALN concept, will provide the warfighter with a robust communication infrastructure enhancing C2 capabilities. HCB connects users operating within disadvantaged conditions to space and terrestrial communications utilizing Deployed Ground Entry Points (DGEP) and aerial nodes. Link 16 Enhancements will develop and field a Link 16 Anti Jam (AJ) capabilities on 4th and 5th generation platform to address Link 16 jamming threats in the contested and highly contested environment. Link 16 Enhancement funding will be utilized for Non recurring engineering and integration of AJ capabilities on airborne and ground platforms. \n\nFamily of Gateways provides for the study (acquisitions current and proposed), analysis, enhancement, development, integration, costing, demonstration, test, and evaluation efforts that will allow joint combat forces to exchange information quickly and accurately by bridging discrete airborne, terrestrial, maritime, and space-based C4ISR networks producing operational effects not possible within individual networks. Gateway functions include enabling interoperability between data formats, protocols, and communication mediums. Additionally, gateway functions extend the connectivity range, consolidate data from multiple networks into high capacity links for transmission to key C2ISR nodes, route information between disadvantaged users, and fuse\/correlate data from multiple sources to improve accuracy. Gateway functions also provide application hosting, shared data storage, on-demand information access, smart data forwarding, and system monitoring and network management. Further, this project supports 5th-to-4th Generation communications capabilities, 5th-to-5th Generation efforts and future TDL communications development. Additionally, Family of Gateways will support to enhance existing TDL performance, through upgrades and engineering analysis of system designs. Efforts in this project include waveform, ground, and rapid acquisition activities supporting Air Force requirements for communications bridging across multiple platforms, sources and communication domains.  Moreover, the E-3G AWACS, 5th-to-4th Generation Gateway effort provides 4th Generation tactical edge assets with a common tactical operating picture for enhanced battlespace awareness via integration of 5th Generation sensor data.  This effort integrates the core components (5th-to-4th Gateway, Correlation\/fusion, and National sensor inputs) for use on the E-3G platform.   \n\nIn FY18 SFF\/DACAS Modernization and System-of-Systems (SoS) Enterprise Integration was a new start.\nIn FY18 Applique Technologies for TDLs was a new start.\nIn FY18 Link 16 Evolution was a new start.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver TDL weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in BA 5, SDD because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

TDLs are used in both peacetime and combat environments to exchange information such as character-oriented and fixed-formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free-text messaging and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when training or fighting under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs increase mission effectiveness by providing enhanced air domain situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, fusion\/correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, digital sharing of machine to machine target and threat information and, thereby, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. TDLs are used by all service, NATO, and coalition theater C2 elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.\n\nThe number of Air Force platforms hosting TDLs has expanded from C2 aircraft (E-3, E-8, E-11A, EQ-4B, etc.) to the fighter, bomber, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), tanker, airlift and other tactical fleets (F-15, F-16, F-22A, Rivet Joint, B-1, B-2, B-52, KC-46, etc.), as well as precision guided munitions. Utilization of TDLs in joint and international environments requires the integration of terminals into host platforms and interoperability of TDL networks across all deployed joint\/Coalition\/NATO platforms. Recent mandates require additional studies and analysis in order to meet frequency reprogramming and cryptographic requirements. \n\nEfforts in this project include waveform and integration activities.\n\nWaveform:\nWaveform activities include, but are not limited to, enabling and supporting Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTACCS), joint\/Coalition\/NATO Interoperability, Link 16 enhancements, and development of a next generation waveform and\/or advanced tactical data link. Funding will provide training, logistics development, testing and certification of individual TDL implementations to joint\/allied standards, establishment of service-wide network management procedures\/operations, and system wide enhancements\/testing, demonstration and experimentation.\n\nIntegration:\nIntegration activities include but are not limited to, Data Link Test Facility (DTF), Block Upgrade 2 (BU2) retrofit\/MIDS JTRS, Block Cycle 1 (BC1) retrofit , Air Force Participating Test Unit (AFPTU), Interoperable System Management and Requirements Transformation (iSMART), Joint Airborne Network Tactical Edge (JAN-TE), Network Centric Capability Assessment (NCCA), NATO interoperability, Coalition interoperability, TDL Planning, Analysis, and Monitoring (TDL PAM), integration analysis of C2 of JALN, Cursor on Target (CoT), Combat Cloud, Tactical Communications Suite (TCS), and analysis of integration on platforms of existing TDN systems, system-of-systems analysis. Funding will ensure continued enhanced interoperability of Air Force\/joint\/Coalition\/NATO assets through efforts such as early systems engineering and use of the POET process for program requirements analysis and architectural design development\/coordination of all TDN standards and management capabilities, configuration management, platform\/system interoperability assessments, development of government reference architectures, integration of cyber technologies, interoperability certification testing, and flight testing, demonstration and experimentation.\n\nActivities include studies and analysis (engineering and cost) to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning efforts for Tactical Data Networks (TDN), including development of joint concepts for C2 of JALN, JALN Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) follow-on analysis, and JALN gateway planning. \n\nActivities also include joint\/Coalition\/NATO Interoperability that provides program office system engineering to support Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case development, FMS planning for tech refresh modifications, Crypto-Modernization, and Net Management.\n\nAgile Communications include the capability to share tactically significant information within\/to\/from highly contested environments in support of the Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan. Agile Communication efforts provide for pre-Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and development activities.  Agile Communications supports the application of open standards & advanced apertures over an Enterprise-wide Aerial Network, enabling all platforms to share combat-relevant data\/info to, from & within the Highly Contested Environment (HCE).\n  \nHigh Capacity Backbone (HCB) effort implements an incremental approach for deploying resilient reachback connectivity to DISN services and in-theater rear echelon organizations through dedicated aerial gateways and opportunistic airborne nodes.  The HCB Transport supports a robust deployable ground infrastructure required, through reach back, range extension and payload control.  It will use an open system approach composed of non-proprietary government and commercial interface standards.\n\nLink 16 Enhancement will develop and field Link 16 Anti Jam (AJ) capabilities on 4th and 5th generation platforms to address Link 16 jamming threats in the contested and highly contested environments. Focus will be directed toward non recurring engineering and integration of AJ capabilities on airborne and ground platforms. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver TDL weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F and 0605898F."

Gateway functions include enabling interoperability between data formats, protocols, and communication mediums. Additionally, gateway functions extend the connectivity range, consolidate data from multiple networks into high capacity links for transmission to key C2ISR nodes, route information between disadvantaged users, and fuse\/correlate data from multiple sources to improve accuracy. Gateway functions also provide application hosting, shared data storage, on-demand information access, smart data forwarding, and system monitoring and network management. Further, this project supports 5th-to-4th Generation communications capabilities, 5th-to-5th Generation efforts and future TDL communications development. Additionally, Family of Gateways will support to enhance existing TDL performance, through upgrades and engineering analysis of system designs. Efforts in this project include waveform, ground, and rapid acquisition activities supporting Air Force requirements for communications bridging across multiple platforms, sources and communication domains. Moreover, the E-3G AWACS, 5th-to-4th Generation Gateway effort provides 4th Generation tactical edge assets with a common tactical operating picture for enhanced battlespace awareness via integration of 5th Generation sensor data.  This effort integrates the core components (5th-to-4th Gateway, Correlation\/fusion, and National sensor inputs) for use on the E-3G platform.\n\nActivities also include studies, analysis, demonstrations and experiments to support both current program planning\/execution and future program planning efforts for Family of Gateways.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver TDL weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F and 0605898F."

The addition of multi-domain capabilities as a future requirement of 5th-to-4th Generation communications capability enables track sharing at the tactical edge for the timely destruction of ground and airborne target sets. These additional capabilities are a combat force multiplier that enhance total force synergy for target prosecution and weapons employment. The initial increment will provide the baseline 5th-to-4th communication capability upon which future requirements will build capability."

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) supports continuing technology investigations.  It provides a coordinated tri-service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  \n\nProject 297 - Munitions Survivability & Logistics: This Project supports the future force by making Army units more survivable through the investigation, testing and demonstration of munitions logistics system improvements that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements.  Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness.  Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated.  The early stages of force deployment are especially critical.  Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets.  These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater.  Loss of these munition stocks could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life.  This Project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.\n\nProject 857 - DoD Explosives Safety Standards : This Project supports the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation efforts of the Department of Defense (DoD) Explosive Safety Standards Board.  It supports explosive safety effects research and testing to quantify hazards and to develop techniques to mitigate those hazards in all DoD manufacturing, testing, transportation, maintenance, storage, disposal of ammunition and explosives operations, and also to develop risk based explosives safety standards.  Results are essential to the development and improvement of quantity-distance standards, hazard classification procedures, cost effective explosion-resistant facility design procedures, and personnel hazard\/protection criteria.\n\nProject 858 - Army Explosives Safety Management Program: This Project establishes, validates or modifies explosives technical safety requirements per Department of Defense Manual 6055.09 and Department of the Army Pamphlet 385-64, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. Project activities promote Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) of new and innovative explosives safety technologies that improve the survivability of Army personnel, facilities, and equipment as well as improve the health, safety and welfare of the general public (with highest priority directed to combat theater of operations).\n\nProject 859 - Life Cycle Pilot Process: This Project supports the implementation of the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) Industrial Base Strategic Plan through technology investigations, model based process controls, pilot prototyping, and industrial assessments.  It will assess life cycle production capabilities required for all ammunition families, address design for manufacturability to facilitate economical production, identify industrial and technology requirements, and address the ability of the production base to rapidly and cost effectively produce quality products.  Cost reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP).  LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation.  In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs)\/No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB).  LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF.\n\nProject F21:  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ammunition Evaluation program funding assures interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance.  The Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC).  In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements.  This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production United States (U.S.) weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability\/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 funding supports NATO small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation, and test operations.  FY 2018 funding also supports JBMOU ballistic testing including firing tables, safety, reliability, and performance.\n\nF24 - Conventional Munitions Demilitarization (Demil): The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization technology Project supports the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) responsibility per Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5160.68 to plan, program, budget and fund a Joint Service Research and Development (R&D) program that develops capability and capacity as well as technology and facilities to support the SMCA mission to demil and dispose of conventional ammunition stored in the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A).  The program goals include SMCA efforts to increase efficiencies and effectiveness to reduce the demil stockpile; reduce processing costs including packaging, handling and crating; and increase capacity through improved demil capabilities and processes.  Project F24 includes activities: (1) to establish requirements and develop processes to focus investments, assess capabilities, analyze alternatives, and recommend and implement R&D projects; (2) to improve products and processes that support existing capabilities; (3) to develop or improve demil methods and processes related to advance the primary demilitarization core thrust areas of destruction, disassembly, removal, resource recovery and recycling, and waste stream treatment; (4) to ensure safe and environmentally acceptable demil operations; (5) to transition R&D products to United States Army depots or plants as well as commercial facilities performing demil; and (6) to mitigate risk and close-out project activities."

This is particularly problematic for lab quantities of explosives (e.g., 500 grams and lower), where the specifics of the construction type, room geometry, standoff, etc., can have a profound effect on the associated hazards.  Current criteria is admittedly conservative in this regime, but testing and analysis are needed to justify reduced safety standoff distances.  This work will leverage previous ATF lab quantities testing by increasing the explosive weight until breach of a sheetrock wall; determine the secondary breach debris hazards from a nominal laboratory room design; and assess overpressurization failure hazards of a nominal laboratory room design.   This will result in reduced safety standoff distances for the conditions tested.  \n\nHazard Division 1.3 testing:  As a result of a study of historical accidents approximately 75% of accidents are initiated by fire versus by detonation via an initiation chain.  Also, the Insensitive Munitions Program has as a primary goal to develop more \u201cinsensitive\u201d munitions and their end state is systems that react by burn only.  These two conditions combine to make the potential for a non-detonation reaction more likely in the event of an explosives accident.  This testing effort is designed to address the gaps in knowledge of HD 1.3\/thermal hazards from a non-detonation reaction by performing testing to characterize the debris hazards from breakup of a confining structure, characterize the directional jetting effects from such structures, and assess the thermal hazard of burning in the open."

Cost reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP).  LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation.  In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs)\/No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB).  LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF."

The Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC).  In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition, and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy, and general product improvements.  This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production United States (U.S.) weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability\/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 funding supports NATO small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation and test operations.  FY 2018 funding also supports JBMOU ballistic testing including firing tables, safety, reliability, and performance."

DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. \n\nDCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.

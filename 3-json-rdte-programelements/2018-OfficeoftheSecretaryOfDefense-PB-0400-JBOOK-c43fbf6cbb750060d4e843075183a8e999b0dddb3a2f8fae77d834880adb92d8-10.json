                            "val": "The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S., interagency, and international users through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation. CTTS is expanding its partnerships with other Defense rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and Interagency users. \n\nCTTS major area of emphasis during FY16 and FY17 will be projects to Countering-ISIL.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytics and Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; Training Technology Development; and a new working group, Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats.\n\nSpecific CTTS areas of emphasis in FY16 and FY17 include Counter-tunnel, Countering-UAVs, Countering-Violent Extremism, and Improving Digital Operations at the tactical level.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use. CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and International customers and partners. \n\nThe CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other Federal Departments and International partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products. \n\nIn FY16, CTTS focused on DoD requirements that supported military forces and interagency operators in demanding or hostile environments such as Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Africa and in the domestic environment by leading the Department in rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as CORIAN and MARS-K counter small UAS systems currently deployed to Iraq; tactical tethered ISR vehicles; applications for operational and intelligence collection and analysis of Publically Available Information (PAI) now a Program of Record for USSOCOM; cyber training COSMO and COG that are now Program of Record for the Special Warfare Center and School; an underwater remote operating vehicle (UROV); miniature handheld spectrometers; ruggedized CB protective clothing; systems integration and environment testing of the HALO Maritime Barrier System; and enhancement of the SUNet, off-GIG encrypted communications and data sharing system.\n\nAt the tactical level, CTTS will increasingly address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM\u2019s field components as they increase their regional operations tempo in Iraq, Syria, and Africa.  CTTS will address weight reduction of small arms and ammunition; and secure communications for small units deployed to austere and hostile environments; and mobile counter small UAS systems. Another area of continued emphasis will be the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in embassy and consulate locations overseas that need increased security.  Additionally, in response to congressional direction, CTTS will continue its partnership with Israel to address their tunnel threat and ensure the joint ventures are beneficial U.S. counter-tunnel activities. \n\nCTTS will continue to actively support the Department\u2019s Homeland Defense mission for advanced technology and capabilities that will (1) enhance security along the U.S. Southwest Border and (2) proactively address improvised devices and other chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats in a domestic environment.  Additionally, CTTS will assist federal; state and local law enforcement in improving their capabilities investigate and mitigate acts of terrorism in CONUS."

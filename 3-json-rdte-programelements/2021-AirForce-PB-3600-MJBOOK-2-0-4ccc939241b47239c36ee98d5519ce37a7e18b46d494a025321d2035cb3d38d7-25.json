            "val": "The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today. The F-15C\/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record. The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep-penetration, and night\/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, a refresh of older F-15C\/D aircraft with the F-15EX and upgrades to newer F-15C\/D aircraft and F-15E aircraft (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology. Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Heads Up Display (HUD) and Heads Down Display, instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR)-based fire control system. The proliferation of fourth-generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated \"double-digit\" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and\/or phased technology\/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. This includes technical and acquisition-related studies to ensure F-15 lethality and survivability beyond 2040.\n\nThe total F-15EX RTD&E funding for FY20 in the amount of $431.8M resides in Program 0207134F Project 670131 ($67.4M) and Project 676020 ($364.4M). FY21 RDT&E funding resides in Program 0207146F.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in Program 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Older F-15C\/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th-generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C\/Ds are beyond their service life and have SERIOUS structural risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C\/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure. \n\nFunds may be used to manufacture aircraft, support equipment, and initial spares to support test activities; integrate hardware and software subsystems; upgrade training systems and systems integration labs; develop training materials and technical manuals; pursue other non-recurring engineering activities to reduce integration risks, ramp up the production line capacity, prepare for flight testing, and investigate technology insertion opportunities; resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources\/Material Shortages (DMSMS) and\/or obsolescence issues; fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness; and cover other related requirements to manufacture and sustain the test aircraft.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2019 Air Force penalty total is $50.0M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation, and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nThe Radar Enhancements (EP) will upgrade the digital Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar capabilities to counter sophisticated electronic threats.  Prior OFP's introduced EP into the C\/D-model fleet. Initial EP capability for APG-82(V)1 equipped E model aircraft took place in Suite 8E. Suite 9 and beyond will add additional EP capability to both the F-15E and F-15C. \n\nFor the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software and hardware upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line is transiting the Air Force to an annual software release to counter the speed of technology and maintain a competitive advantage.  Additionally, the OFP provides the path for integration for other activities into operations.  At any one time, there will normally be three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition\/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort. \n\nInfrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C\/D in a radar-contested environment.\n\nMobile User Objective System (MUOS)\/Second Generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO(SATURN) will provide Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capable Air Force F-15C\/D\/E aircraft the ability to communicate on the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) constellation in support of a NORTHCOM Airspace Control Alert (ACA) requirement. SATURN will replace the Have Quick II and comply with the NSA lease key mandated dates.\n\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) provides Air Traffic Control position and other secondary surveillance data and must be installed on all CONUS aircraft by 2020 IAW FAA mandate. \n\nData Transfer Module II (DTM II) is an upgraded replacement for the obsolete and outdated data transfer device currently in the F-15. DTM is 30 years old and out of storage capacity. DTM II will provide improved mission planning capability, updated interfaces, replace an aging map system, and meet growing security requirements.  \n\nAdvanced Crew Station contains high resolution digital color large area displays; these will replace the current antiquated monochrome displays. These upgraded displays enable accurate distinction and identification of targets, decrease risk of frat\/missed targeting, and enable full utilization of radar capability that significantly enhances situational awareness. \n\nALQ-128a will replace the legacy ALC-128 design and includes development and integration of a re-designed ALQ-128a Electronic Warfare Warning Set (EWWS).\n\nA refresh of the F-15C\/D fleet is critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Older F-15C\/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C\/Ds are beyond their service life and have SERIOUS structural risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C\/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure. Funding supports procurement of two (2) F-15EX aircraft and associated support equipment, training system upgrades and materials, depot stand-up planning, initial spares, and other related items to manufacture the aircraft, provide operational conversion (from F-15C\/D to F-15EX) support, and meet logistics and sustainment requirements.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

Since most subsystems are projected to be mature when required for integration into the F-15EX, the acquisition strategy is deemed low risk. To rapidly field the F-15EX, the USAF plans to focus engineering activities on integrating existing systems and ramping up the production line capacity. Test activities will likewise be tailored to focus on integration of F-15QA, EPAWSS, and the Suite 9.1 OFP, taking appropriate credit for previous USAF and FMS testing. Finally, logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure.\n\nProgram is a continuation of effort which includes the development of all F-15 models.  Funds are executed organically in support of equipment improvement, study, analysis, and test.  Acquisition and management strategies for each program are independently developed and use a variety of contract methods and types to accomplish program objectives."

JIOR uniquely provides Services, Combatant Commanders (CCMD), and other government agencies the ability to test deployment and collaboratively gain insights into advanced Cyberspace, Information Operations (IO), and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities under current and future operational environment conditions. JIOR integrates other cyberspace ranges, replicates critical infrastructure, cyber targets, Internet traffic, and opposing forces.  These provide the capacity to meet Presidential policy and CJCS mandates for training and certification of 6000+ cyber warriors by 2017 and DoD\/Interagency cyber vulnerability assessments. The JIOR security construct allows users to develop, test, and secure their unique cyber capabilities and protect their identity during range activities. The JIOR conducts multiple, simultaneous, and disparate training, testing, and experimentation events."

This program provides funding for the development and integration of electronic warfare training capabilities to include: Air Combat Training Systems (ACTS); threat emitters; advanced radar threat systems; communication jammers; instrumentation equipment\/systems; and command & control and debrief capability. These systems and capabilities support integrated training operations for all aircraft (including 5th Gen) and for joint, coalition, and Live Virtual Constructive training events. \n\nThe Advanced Radar Threat System (ARTS) programs develop, design, build and test threat system simulators based on advanced foreign fielded surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar threat systems. ARTS will be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for 4th and 5th generation aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat to stress their tactics, techniques and procedures. The ARTS-Variant 1 (ARTS-V1) is focused on long-range, re-locatable radar threat systems.  ARTS-Variant 2 (ARTS-V2) creates mobile, short\/medium-range radar threat systems. ARTS-Variant 3 (ARTS-V3) will establish a long range, high power SAM radar simulator. ARTS-Variant 4 (ARTS-V4) will establish a highly mobile, tactical modern threat simulator. The ARTS program supports early research, studies, technology development, and planning for next generation threat systems that challenge the Air Force's asymmetric advantage. The ARTS programs also fund development of high fidelity surrogate targets matching simulated threat systems, to stress 5th generation sensor fusion capabilities. \n\nLegacy range threat systems include Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES), Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) system, Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) system, Band Simulator, Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) system, and legacy Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) systems.  The Legacy Range Threat Systems Low Cost Mod (LRTSLCM) effort funds development of modifications for legacy threat systems to provide continued combat training relevancy and enhanced systems capabilities.  Enhancements focus on upgrading threat systems to match fielded modifications for foreign threat systems faced by combat aircrews. The Common Electronic Attack Receiver (CEAR) provides reactive training and enhanced debriefs using legacy threats. The Digital Threat Relevancy (DTR) effort upgrades Band Simulator and other legacy emitters with modern electronics to improve threat relevance and sustainability. The Double Digit Threat Emitter (DDTE) effort leverages JTE to provide a lower cost EW simulator, enabling greater on-range threat density of advanced SAM radars. \n\nP5 Combat Training System program addresses new capability requirements for the fielded P5 system, to include continued operations in a GPS-denied environment.  Lastly, this program funds ongoing analyses, studies, risk reduction efforts, and\/or technology development to enhance Operational Training Infrastructure (OTI), such as combat training range equipment integration into a blended training (Live, Virtual, Constructive) architecture, communication and GPS jammers, weapon drop scoring systems and infrastructure networks. These enhancements add a critical dimension to exercises and optimize warfighter training.\n\nIn FY19 Live Mission Operations Capability(LMOC) is a new start. In FY18 ARTS-V3 and ARTS-V4 were new starts.  \n\nThis program element 0604735F may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Combat Training Range weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

Various aircraft platforms may train against ARTS-V2, but the most stringent requirements placed on ARTS-V2 design come from fifth generation aircraft capabilities. Additionally, ongoing analyses, studies, and risk reduction efforts will focus on integrating ARTS-V2 and other systems into Live Virtual Constructive architectures."

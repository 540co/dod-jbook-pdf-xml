            "val": "Space and Missile Defense Command-Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC-ARSTRAT) funding is for management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DoD) missile systems for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS). RTS began its funding under Program Element (PE)0605301A, Project DX2 in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. Beginning in FY 2018, operational and mission support functions at RTS are realigned to PE 0606002A. RTS is a tenant on the United States (US) Army Garrison - Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA), located within the Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (Space Situational Awareness; object tracking & identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs.  Programs supported include Army Missile Defense, Air Force, and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational\/demonstration\/validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), ionospheric studies, space debris tracking, and data collection in support of space experiments.  RTS is a government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M). Program funds contracting support for end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts. Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for RTS instrumentation suites and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system. The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems. These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center. The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at RTS, are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability. The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world providing critical intelligence data.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS. Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and AEGIS weapon systems), and NASA's space experiments."

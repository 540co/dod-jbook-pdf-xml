A modern and capable NBCRV SSU is a critical component for Joint Force success when operating in the complex CBRN environment.  Operating with combat vehicles fighting against increasingly capable and determined enemies requires like capability with regard to protection, mobility, and lethality.  The NBCRV SSU will accomplish this by integrating the capability for command and control of unmanned systems with CBRN payload.  The NBCRV SSU will provide a CBRN detection, tipping and queueing to accomplish desired standoff distances to keep the warfighter out of harm's way and reduce sustainment costs over the current system.  A Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuver speed when conducting NBC missions and increase reliability."

Following the testing and demonstration, the hardware and software will be fixed and updated for demonstration in JWA 20 and test in FY 2020.  An In Progress Review will be held in late FY 2022 to execute a Modification Work Order for fielding in FY 2023.  This schedule was accelerated from the previous schedule based on the maturity of the sensor and guidance from the Chief of Staff of the Army.  The NBCRV SSU program will conduct system level testing in FY 2021 using Defense Wide funding after the Modification Work Order In Process Review to ensure system performance."

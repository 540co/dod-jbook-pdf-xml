The BAT-A system is the Army\u2019s biometric tactical collection devices which collect, match, store, and share biometric and contextual information on Known & Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A devices are also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police).   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone and other OCONUS contingency operations for the past decade.  The current BAT-A systems will serve as the Army biometrics enduring capability through FY22.  All research and development efforts are now concluded for BAT-A.  PL BAT-A will continue to serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility as the BAT-A is now a Post Milestone C program of record in sustainment.\n\nThe FY18 Base Funding of $2.537 million supports the program efforts to begin the transition phase from the current BAT-A POR configuration to the updated Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC) to replace BAT-A.

This solution will meet the requirements of rapid DNA for JUONS CC-0548.  United States Central Command (CENTCOM) submitted JUONS CC-0548 on 11 Dec 15 for enhanced biometric capabilities to support current operations.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated 5 key requirements of JUONS CC-0548 on 3 June 2016 and identified the requirements as \"key enablers\" to existing JEON CCE-0008 (near Real-Time Identity Operations).  The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) assigned execution responsibility for the validated 5 key requirements in JUONS CC-0548 to the Army on 30 June 2016.  The Army Acquisition Executive assigned OPR to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors\/Project Manager for DoD Biometrics on 13 September 2016.\n\nFY18 Base funding of $2.537 million is the initial effort to transition from the current BAT-A configuration to an updated Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC).  The NXGBCC will support the Army Force Protection and Identity Activities. The NXGBCC will be a part of the DoD Biometric Enterprise. The NXGBCC shall collect, match, store, share, analyze, reference, and manage contextual data and biometrics.  This includes iris, fingerprint, facial images, palm prints and voice on Known & Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals to inform the warfighter in a decide\/act response. The NXGBCC is the successor to the Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army Program of Record capability. \n\nFY18 OCO funding of $3.886 million supports Five Vigilant Pursuit System Sets (10 vehicles total plus equipment) are currently deployed in support of OFS (two sets) and OIR (three sets).  The Vigilant Pursuit System currently consists of 2 vehicles with integrated Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages installed on MATVs. The funding supports developmental activities to create modularized, vehicle-independent and tailorable Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages that can be installed and removed in a matter of minutes on any vehicle type to meet specific mission needs. Specific activities include hardware development for critical hardware components that cannot be commercially procured necessary to refactor the Multi-INT capability packages to work on any vehicle platform and software development necessary to replace\/upgrade open source code that is no longer current\/viable and is therefore more difficult and expensive to maintain or completely unusable.  In addition, funding will support development efforts for modular open architectures to significantly reduce SWAP and enhance multi INT sensing, processing, collection and dissemination.\n\nThe remaining FY18 OCO funding of $2.150 million supports the development of new software code & associated testing necessary to deliver an instance of the Biometric Intelligence Information Repository (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by NGIC specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for OFS and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) C2S cloud.

Specific activities include hardware development for critical hardware components that cannot be commercially procured necessary to refactor the Multi-INT capability packages to work on any vehicle platform and software development necessary to replace\/upgrade open source code that is no longer current\/viable and is therefore more difficult and expensive to maintain or completely unusable.  \n\t\nFY2018 funding of $2.150 million will be applied to the development of new software code & associated testing necessary to deliver an instance of the Biometric Intelligence Information Repository (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by NGIC specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for OFS and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) C2S cloud.  The new, more capable software will facilitate automated information exchange with complimentary community programs resident on the IC ITE C2S cloud to support the production of a Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) containing all available IC Biometrics and Identity Intelligence.  The Army will execute this funding in FY18 and deliver capabilities within 12 months."

The primary activity that will be used to gather the data, analyze the data, and determine a trade-off methodology will be a technical study of commercially available biometrics collection and communications capabilities, using a functional and technical decomposition of the NXGBCC Capabilities Production Document (CPD) as the criteria set.  The PMO will work with the TRADOC Capability Manager to analyze the NXGBCC Capability Production Document (CPD) and determine the appropriate level of functional and technical requirements decomposition.  The current acquisition strategy is to award the Technical Services contract during 2QFY18. \n\nFY17 RDT&E OCO acquisition strategy reflected from the supplemental request is for the current contractor to further develop and refine three portable DNA prototype solutions for JUONS CC-0548.

Also, funds will enable the contractor begin initial operational fielding and test simulation for an operational or military utility assessment. The planned delivery date of the prototypes is during 2QFY18.\n\nThe FY18 RDT&E OCO acquisition strategy will continue to solicit a contractor to continue to develop activities for the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved Vigilant Pursuit Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to modularize the Multi-INT collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination hardware and software to enhance usability from the Soldier perspective.  A contractor will also be selected to finish developing and testing the I2AR capability to install and configure the capability on the IC ITE Cloud on the JWICS and SIPRNet domains."

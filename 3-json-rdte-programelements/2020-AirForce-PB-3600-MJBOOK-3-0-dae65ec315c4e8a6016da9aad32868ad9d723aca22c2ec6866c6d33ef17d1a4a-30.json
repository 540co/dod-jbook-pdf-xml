        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies supporting the horizontal and\/or vertical integration of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems.  The result of such integration is a multi-intelligence (multi-INT) sensor network.  Operationally, NCCT core technologies provide a tactical collaborative multi-INT geolocation capability employed against high-value targets.  NCCT software supports Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cross-cueing and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate collection activities across the NCCT network.  NCCT correlation and fusion software ingests collection data to produce a single, composite track (geolocation and identification) in near real-time for high-value targets.  SUTER supports development of sub nodal analysis tools.  Operationally, such tools can be used to identify the nodes within an adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects.\n\nNCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, a network messaging standard, correlation and fusion software, software supporting tactical-to-national Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Concept of Operations (CONOPS), NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items and operator interfaces.  Development funds support software modifications required for technology modernization specific to network and fusion architecture design, data fusion algorithms and cyber security, while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). FY 2020 funding will be dedicated to transitioning software development from Core Technology to a cloud architecture (v6.0) and fielding follow-on Core Technology Software versions as necessary. \n\nSUTER develops concepts, TTPs and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.  SUTER's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all Air Operations Centers (AOCs), taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and\/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ M2M interfaces and IP communications to impact these target sets by attacking or influencing\/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: Radio Frequency and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) receivers, transceivers, etc.  The three main pieces of the SUTER CONOPS include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, Joint Information Operations Warfare Center, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface, all involved players monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment\/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NCCT and SUTER capability.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The result of such integration is a multi-intelligence (multi-INT) sensor network.  Operationally, NCCT core technologies provide a tactical collaborative multi-INT geolocation capability employed against high-value targets.  NCCT software supports Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cross-cueing and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate collection activities across the NCCT network.  NCCT correlation and fusion software ingests collection data to produce a single, composite track (geolocation and identification) in near real-time for high-value targets.  \n\nNCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, a network messaging standard, correlation and fusion software, software supporting tactical-to-national (SIGINT) CONOPS, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and operator interfaces.  Development funds support software modifications required for technology modernization specific to network and fusion architecture design, data fusion algorithms, and cyber security, while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  FY 2020 funding will be dedicated to transitioning software development from Core Technology to a cloud architecture (v6.0) and fielding follow-on Core Technology Software versions as necessary."

SUTER's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all Air Operations Centers (AOCs), taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and\/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ M2M interfaces and IP communications to impact these target sets by attacking or influencing\/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: Radio Frequency and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) receivers, transceivers, etc.  The three main pieces of the SUTER CONOPS include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, Joint Information Operations Warfare Center, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface, all involved players monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment\/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions."

In FY 2017, due to software limitations and a lack of technical maturity of SUTER's capabilities, the Air Force decided not to proceed with the 645 AESG technical plan on SUTER and transitioned SUTER program execution responsibilities to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). AFRL is increasing the technical maturity of the SUTER software and capabilities to a level suitable for operational capability and for transition to PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground\/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Common Imagery Ground\/Surface Systems. This transition will be made in order to facilitate the development and integration of SUTER as a mission application on Open Architecture (OA) DCGS."

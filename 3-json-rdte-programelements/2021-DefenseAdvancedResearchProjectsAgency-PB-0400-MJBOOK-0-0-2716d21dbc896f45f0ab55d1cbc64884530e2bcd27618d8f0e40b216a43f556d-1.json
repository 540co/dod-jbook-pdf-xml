Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in warfighter care related to health monitoring, restorative function of the body, and prevention and treatment of infectious disease. Efforts will draw upon computational modeling and experimental data to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. To enable in-theater, continuous monitoring, protection, and treatment of warfighters, this project will explore multiple diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including developing techniques to protect against emerging pathogens; exploring methods to slow damage from pathological infection or traumatic injury; and leveraging fundamental and engineered biological mechanisms to enhance tolerance to insults such as pain and altitude."

Tools such as detailed molecular analysis and bioinformatics will be leveraged. Researchers will develop models to quantify the probability of pathogen disease transmission from animals to humans.

Predicting such jumps is a key capability to mitigating outbreaks originating in animal reservoirs."

Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance. Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness. The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust is investigating fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses. This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants. Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a national security risk as a potential pandemic."

The Physiological Overmatch program will investigate innovative approaches to leverage biological systems to adapt to environmental challenges during deployment. The program will initiate work in aiding the deployed soldier's ability to defend against biological pathogens and chemical contaminants, resist fatigue, and receive adequate nutrition and hydration. Advances in engineered cells, bioelectronics, and cellular feedback circuits will enable the controlled, in vivo release of therapies as needed by the warfighter. This approach represents a significant enhancement to warfighter performance by providing internal protection from novel threats."

Research efforts in this area applied recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness. One approach to achieve the program's goal was to identify the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults. Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species were combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival. By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, a survival blueprint is being developed to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection. This approach was orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention. Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens."

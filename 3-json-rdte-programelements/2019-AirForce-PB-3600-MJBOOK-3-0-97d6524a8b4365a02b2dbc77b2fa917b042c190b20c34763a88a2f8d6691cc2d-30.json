It provides for modeling\/ simulation, training and systems engineering. This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near real time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). A portion of the funding in Project 674818 will be distributed in priority order, as supported by Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) efforts and set by the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Capabilities  Working Group (GCWG), for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities within the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the ASI efforts. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. ASARS 2B efforts include, but are not limited to, development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Additionally, funding covers GCWG Secretariat to manage GCWG planning, processes, and establish an Air Force GEOINT architecture.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.\n\nThe funds in this project are distributed in priority order, as supported by the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and set by the GCWG, for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the ASI AoA as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. ASARS 2B efforts include but are not limited to development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test, and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.\n\nInclusive in I&TS is the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface Systems Automated Target Recognition (ATR) effort to further mature a robust capability to detect all classes of targets through camouflage. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

MUSE is also know as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force Application. The MUSE\/AFSERS is a software suite that simulates ISE & strike systems, tailored air vehicle & data links, and visualization systems used for payload product outputs-including Full Motion Video (FMV), Still Frame Imagery, or GMTO data. Air vehicles, sensors, datalinks, takeoff and landing systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS and RPA ground stations, when actual ground stations are unavailable. FMV, still frame imagery, or GMTI data are provided. Outputs are compliant with applicable DoD standards and are continually tested against actual ground ISR processors to ensure interoperability with over 40 systems within DoD.  \n\nThe Services and combatant commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE\/AFSERS creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures refinement, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the combatant commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.\n\nThe MUSE\/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.\n\nMUSE\/AFSERS is currently in use within all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M\/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the AFSERS provides imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of critical imagery processes. The MUSE\/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.\n\nThe Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is the center of excellence that supports the UAS and RPA programs within the services by providing the system engineering, test and integration, interoperability, rapid technology insertion and training to address MUSE\/AFSERS requirements. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC\/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. The JTC\/SIL contributes to the distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, and are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution."

The Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) approved Air Combat Command's recommendation to transition Gorgon Stare from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to an Air Force Enduring Capability in November 2014. Gorgon Stare's requirements are documented in the Gorgon Stare Wide Area Airborne Sensor Capabilities Production Document (draft).  The acquisition strategy for this Air Force podded sensor suite solution is sustainment of the currently fielded capabilities with any upgrades implemented via validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.  \n\nDevelopment efforts conducted with FY 2015 Congressionally-added funds included efforts focused primarily on the development of a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability in support of an Urgent Operational Need.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2016 Congressionally-added RDT&E funds included further development and system integration lab testing of Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Gorgon Stare Increment 2 Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors.  Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for future airborne integration efforts as required.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2017 Congressionally-added funds further development efforts associated with BLOS, to include first article testing for phase 1 delivery to the field, expected late FY 2018.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning."

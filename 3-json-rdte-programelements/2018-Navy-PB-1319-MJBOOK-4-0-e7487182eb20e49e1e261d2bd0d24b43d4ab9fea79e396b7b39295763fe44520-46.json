For the United States Navy (USN) RQ-21A will provide persistent RSTA support for tactical maneuver decisions and unit-level force defense\/force protection for Navy Ships, Marine Corps land forces, Navy Expeditionary Combat Command forces, and Navy Special Warfare Units.  This is a combined development program between Navy and Marine Corps. This submission is the Marine Corps portion of the program and has been coordinated with the Navy budget submission PE 0305234N RQ-21A BLACKJACK.\n\nThe RQ-21A system will continue to evolve addressing capability shortfalls, new requirements, obsolescence equipment, reliability, maintainability, and safety issues. Additional capabilities and\/or system upgrades may include Navy Command and Control integration, Weapons Integration, Heavy Fuel Engine, Short Wave Infrared, Laser Designator, Frequency Agile Communications Relay, Digital Common Data link, and cyclic refresh of the Electro-optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) camera."

            "val": "Designated as the Executive Agent, the Secretary of the Air Force will lead the Unified Platform effort.  \n\nUnified Platform (UP) provides the Cyber Mission Forces (CMFs), USCYBERCOM, AF Major Commands (MAJCOMs) a Joint cyber operations platform capable of mission planning, data analytics, and decision support for the execution of full-spectrum cyberspace operations at the operational through tactical levels of warfare.  \n\nUP integrates existing, but disparate, Service-specific cyber capability, delivering a minimum viable product (MVP).  Subsequent build iterations will continue to deliver a flexible, interoperable, and scalable warfighter capability.  In order to match the speed-of-need of the highly dynamic cyberspace domain, the UP will implement a scaled agile development framework to facilitate the rapid development, integration, and fielding of capabilities.  The UP program will execute the development requirements provided by Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in conjunction with US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) stakeholders in accordance with the prioritization provided by UP governance. The UP program will exercise a comprehensive, Service agnostic, acquisition approach to include laboratory, industry, and academia.  \n\nUP directly supports the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), USCYBERCOM operational directives, the latest AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JCC2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nPrototyping efforts are executed in a operational development environment to rapidly develop and evaluate capability within relevant warfighter timelines.  Prototyping efforts are transitioned to foundational efforts once included in the UP baseline.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because this budget activity includes efforts that are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

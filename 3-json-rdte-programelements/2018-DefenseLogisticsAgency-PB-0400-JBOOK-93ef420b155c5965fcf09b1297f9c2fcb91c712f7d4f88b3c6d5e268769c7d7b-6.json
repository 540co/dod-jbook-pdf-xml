Base: FY17PB ($26.657M) + Request for Additional Appropriations ($3.800M required to address emergency warfighter readiness. Funds are in support of the production environment for new agencies and meet the additional vendor software server requirements as DAI updates the other portions of the DAI Suite including, Operating system upgrade, Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition, and other applications\/utilities to maintain currency with support. The increases will largely support Washington Headquarters Services and supported agencies. The data volume for WHS is roughly three times the volume of the largest DAI deployed agencies. Additionally, the growth in the number and size of attachments has resulted in higher storage requirements. This funding will also support additional equipment and services from Defense Information Systems Agency's Defense Enterprise Computing Center Ogden, UT.)\n\nPB18 increase in funding to complete development efforts."

                            "val": "The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness. Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting. These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.\n\nThe DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies\u2019 financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.  The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a \u201c.mil\u201d environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.\n\nThe DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.3 (R12).  DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.  The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).\n\nDAI supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, \u201cReform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise\u201d. DAI is also aligned to the  DOD Agency Strategic Fiscal Years 2015-2018, Goal 5: Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution, Key Strategic Initiative - Improving competitiveness through accountability and efficiency and SO 5.2: Improve financial processes, controls, and information via audit readiness. The objective of the DAI system is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data.\n\nThe primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)\/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department\u2019s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay (P2P); Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Release (Rel) 1 provided an application upgrade to Oracle R12 along with (P2P) enhancements facilitating SFIS\/SLOA compliance and automated Time and Labor absence management.  Rel 2 introduced Grants Financial Management accounting and the start of a phased implementation of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) capabilities. Future capabilities will support Rel 3 Direct Treasury Disbursing and Budget Formulation as well as Rel 4 Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).\n\n\nDAI is currently implemented at 20 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 29,990 users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) assertion packages.\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n\u2022\tCommon business processes and Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS and SLOA);\n\u2022\tAccess to real-time financial data transactions;\n\u2022\tSignificantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n\u2022\tEnhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; and\n\u2022\tUse of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\n\nThe DAI PMO completed the Oracle R12 application upgrade.  The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition\/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security\/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer\/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.  \n\nDLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager and PMO staff.  The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing.  While the DAI PMO serves as systems integrator, niche activities; i.e. P2P, development, are contracted."

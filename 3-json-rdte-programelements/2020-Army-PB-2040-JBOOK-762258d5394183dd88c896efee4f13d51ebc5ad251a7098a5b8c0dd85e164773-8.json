            "val": "This program element funds continuous efforts in the development of modernized tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems that are mission enablers and enable safety of aircraft operations.  ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil, military, domestic and international ATC mandates and combat identification requirements.  \n\nTactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) is the Army's program of record for Airspace Control (AC) and enroute Air Traffic Services (ATS). Continued compatibility and interoperability with the Army Mission Command Information System (MCIS) requires development, testing and integration of new web-based services for AC into common MCIS hardware, while meeting the evolving Common Operating Environment (COE) standards. Includes development and testing of improvements in fusing Blue Force Tracker radar, Identify Friend or Foe, and additional sensor feeds.  TAIS develops software and hardware for ATS and AC missions to operate effectively in a dynamic net-centric interconnected environment to further enhance airspace integration and dynamic management capabilities for aviation gateway to mission command.\n\nAir Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) is an Airport Surveillance Radar and Precision Approach Radar system that provides ATS at Army terminal airfields and landing sites at Division, Corps, and Echelons Above Corps to include services for Joint and Allied aircraft.  ATNAVICS will integrate the Transportable Radar Identification and Recognition capabilities to control aircraft both Outside of the Continental United States and Continental United States. ATNAVICS will network its radar picture and interrogator data to aviation and joint network nodes through TAIS.  As the Department of Defense transitions military aircraft to positional self-reporting technologies, flight information will be captured by the upgraded Interrogation Friend-or-Foe (IFF) system.  The upgraded IFF allows ATC reception of aircraft self-reporting data to include the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast and integrates local radar feeds and self-reporting aircraft positional data into a correlated situational awareness air picture. \n\nTactical Terminal Control System (TTCS) is a mobile ATC communications system that provides initial ATS at remote landing sites and drop zones. It enables secure ground-to-air and ground-to-ground communications between Army aircraft, other services, Allied aircraft, and ground stations. TTCS provides aircraft separation and ground control capabilities, a meteorological measuring system for basic weather information, Blue Force Tracker which provides near real time situational awareness and precision location capability."

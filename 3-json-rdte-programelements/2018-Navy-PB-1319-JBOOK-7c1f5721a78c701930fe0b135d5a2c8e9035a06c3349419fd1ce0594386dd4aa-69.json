The ability to pass sensitive and critical data across security domains and to our allied and coalition partners in a timely fashion can only be met by accredited CDS systems such as RM.  RM enables the Navy to operate in a multi-national environment.\n\nTIS RM provides automated, bi-directional sanitization, transliteration and guarding capability for formatted and unformatted data between security enclaves.  RM helps ensure critical intelligence is provided quickly to operational decision-makers.  TIS RM provides the capability to disseminate information for operating forces worldwide, including the operating forces of key allies in the Pacific, Central and European Command regions.  This capability to move all-source intelligence-derived track information into the realm of the operational community significantly improves the situational awareness of tactical operators and planners.  Unformatted data is handled by the Information Review Process (IRP).  The system provides cross domain services to a wide variety of customers including Combatant Commanders, Air Force (Shared Early Warning program), Army (Blue Force Tracking Program), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command (NCDOC), Naval Modular Automated Communication Systems (NAVMACS), Mobile User Objective Systems (MUOS), Navy (Global Command and Control System - Maritime\/J (GCCS-M\/J), Automatic Identification System (AIS), Maritime Operations Centers (MOC), Distributed Common Ground System-Navy (DCGS-N), Tactical Ranges (TR), and numerous other DoD and Intelligence agencies."

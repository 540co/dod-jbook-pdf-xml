The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by distributed electronics is attributable to radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF and optoelectronic circuits, devices, materials and wireless power (and data) transfer. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

Research develops capabilities to enhance\/update provisioned (baseline) standard, sharable, geospatial foundation (SSGF) data through automated analytics on multi-sourced spatial data resulting in streamlined, enhanced high fidelity terrain analysis products. Reducing data gaps and processing timelines will greatly increase Soldier situational awareness and support faster decision making in complex terrain. \n\nWork in this Project complements PE 0603463A Network C3I Advanced Technology \/ Project AU1 (Tactical GeoSpatial Information Capabilities ATech).\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and coordinated with the United State Army Futures Command"

New atmospheric sensing technologies are developed that enable near-real-time, high-resolution measurements of atmospheric parameters via light-weight systems that can be employed in tactical domains. Efforts include high-resolution local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions that can accommodate the effects of dense urban and complex, mountainous terrain. Both physics-based and rule-based decision support systems are developed for assessing the impacts of weather\/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution; battlefield visualization; reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web-enabled tactical decision aids, long-range precision fires; and modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games\n\nThis work provides technologies for evaluation by and\/or transitions to the Department of Defense weather and operations community including: Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammunition-PM Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for meteorological message input to field artillery targeting systems; Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A); the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) to improve their operational weather support to the Army.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

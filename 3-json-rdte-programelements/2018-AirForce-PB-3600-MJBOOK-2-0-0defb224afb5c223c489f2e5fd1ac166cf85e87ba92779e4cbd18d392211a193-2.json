URT produces RPA pilots and Sensor Operators from accession sources to man RPA squadrons. Success of the program is heavily dependent on Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System (DTS) to prepare undergraduate students for entry in RPA Formal Training Units (FTU). PRIME has completed 6 Phases of development and is now at baseline functionality. PRIME is a desktop similar to the Reaper training system now in use to train undergraduate RPA pilots and sensor operators.  PRIME currently emulates the MQ-9 Reaper and needs to keep pace with that baseline system and expand to other RPAs in order to maintain concurrency and relevancy. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\"DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

T-38s first entered service in 1961 and average over 49 years old.\n\nT-38C Avionics System obsolescence remediation efforts to qualify updated systems will continue from FY2016 through 2018 with development of a replacement Mission Display Processor, refurbishment of the existing Heads-Up Display, development and integration of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast solution as well as replacement of the Very High Frequency Communication radio system and the Very High Frequency Navigation radio system. The development and integration of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast solution will also include the T-38A\/B aircraft.\n \nAdditionally, studies & development efforts to support future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to address obsolescence issues and the regular block upgrades are required to keep the system current. These will be accomplished with O&M unless block upgrade provides additional capabilities. Block upgrades incorporate software and\/or hardware improvements to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration or National Airspace System and to address flight safety issues.  The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices."

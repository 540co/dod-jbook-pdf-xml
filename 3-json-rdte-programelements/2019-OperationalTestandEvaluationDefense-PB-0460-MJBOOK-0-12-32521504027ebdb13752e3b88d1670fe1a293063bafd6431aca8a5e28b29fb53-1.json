The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.

Focus areas for JLF include projects that either: 1) characterize new survivability issues; 2) characterize new lethality issues; 3) improve accuracy and fidelity of weapon data; 4) improve test methods; 5) improve modeling and simulation methods; or 6) develop vulnerability data libraries for emerging non-kinetic threats.\n\n\tJLF Air projects will continue to evaluate technologies and techniques to decrease vulnerabilities to all currently tested aircraft, against operationally relevant threats.  Previously initiated projects that will be continued include developing a model for the OG-7V fragmentation grenade, quantifying the penetration of armor piercing incendiary munitions, evaluating the effectiveness of CV-22 Wing Fire Protection Systems, and evaluating the vulnerability of engines to MANPADS.  New efforts will be initiated to (1) determine the root cause of CH-53 and CH-47 self-sealing bladder performance issues; (2) measure flammability traits of AH-64E Fire Detection Expansion Systems; and (3) develop a 12.7 x 108 mm Heat (High) Explosive Incendiary threat model prediction.\n\n\tJLF Ground projects will continue to optimize the mix of 30 mm ammunition, determine the fragment spray pattern and velocity for the MK84 warhead, and determine\/mitigate collateral damage effects.  Several new efforts will be initiated to develop better test methodologies:  (1) develop instrumented inert warheads to mimic rocket-propelled grenade and anti-tank guided munitions; (2) develop better underbody blast threat and blast box analysis; and (3) develop improved instrumentation to assess local accelerative loading due to blast effects within armored vehicles.  One effort will improve modeling and simulation of buried underbody blast effects.  Finally, one effort will analyze statistical quantification of probability estimates of small caliber munitions in order to minimize the number of Live Fire tests required.\n\n\tJLF Sea projects include improving the modeling of simulation of equipment failure due to thermal effects, developing modeling tools for structural damage due to underwater explosions and their resulting bubble loading, and improving vulnerability hydrocodes by generating underwater explosion data that mimics multiple bubble pulsations.\n\n\tLive Fire initiatives will also include continued support of the execution and further development of a ground vehicle survivability course.\n\nJASP\n\nIn FY 2017 the JASP will continue work on at least 28 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiate 12 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness.

Program efforts include, but are not limited to, the following projects: directed energy protective equipment; flight helmets and visors; oxygen breathing systems for aircrew; radios and locator beacons; support equipment; nuclear flash blindness protection; night vision devices; noise reduction devices; anti-gravity (anti-G) suits; flame resistant, retardant and blast\/ballistic protective gear; aircraft seating; impact protection equipment; flotation devices; parachutes; ejection seats; and other aircrew\/life support\/ground crew systems required by the warfighter. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver these described capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nBA 5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

The Cold Weather Aviation System (CWAS), Aircrew Body Armor (ABA), BA-X Low Profile Parachute (LPP) and Nuclear Flash Blindness Goggles (NFBG) are currently the active programs within Life Support Systems (LSS).

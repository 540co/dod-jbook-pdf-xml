            "val": "The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in support of prototype experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites at the RDT&E Support Complex (RSC) and the Mobile Range Flight (MRF) at Kirtland, NM and at Schriever AFB, CO. The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed\/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions. The RDSMO program is responsible for transitions of designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs.  In addition, RDSMO supports the deployment and sustainment of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations as AFSPC transitions to an Enterprise-based ground C2.  Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.\n\nThe primary objective of the MMSOC C2\/GSE environment is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&D, prototype and operational systems and to transition R&D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard hardware and software infrastructure to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations;(3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&E of new satellite and C2 systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and legacy satellite missions. A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon and to meet the evolving initiatives of the current and future space enterprise.\n\nThis program previously contained the EGS project as part of the evolving current and future space domain. MMSOC capability will transition to become the EGS C2 product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and resiliency in space program ground systems. The RDSMO program will continue to support all mission sets described above as the EGS capability becomes the primary ground C2 system for AFSPC and other users. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver warfighting space capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed\/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions. The RDSMO program is responsible transitions for designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs.  In addition, RDSMO supports the deployment and sustainment of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations as AFSPC transitions to an Enterprise-based ground C2.  Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.\n\nThe primary objective of the MMSOC C2\/GSE environment is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&D, prototype and operational systems and to transition R&D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard hardware and software infrastructure to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations;(3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&E of new satellite and C2 systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and legacy satellite missions. A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon and to meet the evolving initiatives of the current and future space enterprise."

In addition to the infrastructure, EGS expanded its agile development scrum teams to provide cyber security, automation, coding, and established a development-to-operations pipeline so that EGS will be able to on-board at least 4 satellites\/payloads in FY19."

MMSOC capability will transition to become the EGS command and control (C2) product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and  resiliency in space program ground systems. The EGS capability will become the primary ground C2 system for AFSPC and other users.\n\nThe main objective of the EGS is to provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems. EGS will focus efforts on developing and integrating data centers in laboratories at three separate sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cybersecurity development and implementation."

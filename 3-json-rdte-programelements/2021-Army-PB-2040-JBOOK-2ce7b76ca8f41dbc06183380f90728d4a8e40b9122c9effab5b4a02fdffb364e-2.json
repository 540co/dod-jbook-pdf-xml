The Reagan Test Site with its remote location and one of kind instrumentation systems provides a strategic test environment that cannot be replicated. In order to continue its critical mission of testing missile systems that are of paramount importance to the defense of the nation, the RTS instrumentation systems must be continuously updated and upgraded to support the emerging technologies being developed by the Department of Defense (DOD) such as hypersonics and other advanced weapons systems. Without modernization these instrumentation systems face obsolescence or degraded capability and the inability to provide the critical data needed for continued materiel development. Without instrumentation on par with the technologies being utilized in emerging systems, the materiel developer will be unable to complete their test programs or pass programmatic milestones toward deployment. These funds provide modernization of the radar, telemetry, optics, range safety, communications, command\/control and other equipment essential to meet test and evaluation requirements of the Services and DoD agencies. The RTS instrumentation is required to support data collection for test & evaluation assessments and operational decisions that have strategic implications for the Army, Navy, Air Force, United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other customers. RTS, located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Funding will enable RTS to continue to meet customer objectives and sustain the required instrumentation suite."

In addition, this approach will enable centralized command and control of the telemetry equipment increasing efficiency in mission preparation and execution. The telemetry back-end processing chain is currently comprised of discrete frequency- specific hardware components that are replicated for each telemetry channel required for a test event. This activity will develop a scalable frequency-agnostic, software-based solution that runs on commodity computer servers. More complex missions (e.g., Over-the-air (OTA) operational testing of the Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS)) will continue to require more telemetry channels, but this activity will avoid much of that future cost.

Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems. Project focus is to address Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E)-identified Army test realism shortfalls.\n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than 1.500 million per year or 7.500 million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.\n\nThe DOT&E annual report to Congress identified shortfalls in the Army's abilities to create realistic operational environments. The Integrated Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) Test Environment (ILTE) project will address multiple shortfalls identified by DOT&E. ILTE is a portfolio of related development efforts that will deliver a system of systems to provide a Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) and instrumentation suite that delivers a high fidelity, realistic, real-time capability to measure hardware and personnel performance in modern combat environments. ILTE will enable testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of the Army Equipment Modernization Plan. ILTE also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future weapon systems in a realistic operational environment. ILTE will transition Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) developed performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning System (GPS), encryption components, and integrate operational realistic digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield. Improvements will enable the ILTE system of systems to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles. This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs), M1A2 Abrams, M2A4 Bradley, Stryker, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), Apache AH-64E, Gray Eagle and other operational tests."

Since existing range radar instrumentation is aged beyond useful life and cannot adequately support emerging test requirements, the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) recapitalizes and develops modern instrumentation radars to replace obsolete tracking and surveillance radars at U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities, which include: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ. The project will deliver capability in two block increments: Block I will recapitalize or replace existing radar systems, and Block II will develop a Long Range Radar which is compliant with ATEC's Test Capability Requirements Document (TCRD). The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems will provide the Army with critical testing data essential for the development of next generation technology and advanced system capabilities. The RRRP provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression, and reliability. The planned solution to meet program requirements consists of four primary items: Long Range Single Object Tracking Radars (SOTR), Long Range Multiple Object Tracking Radars (MOTR), Medium Range Radars (MRR), and Short Range Radars (SRR). The resulting systems will not only reduce operation and sustainment costs for the ranges, but will improve data collection, thus enhancing development of Army systems being tested at these ranges. The current fleet of instrumentation radars located at ATC, WSTC, and YTC has become antiquated to the extent that they are not able to support the test needs of the test centers. \n\nThis Project will procure commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and\/or modified commercial off-the-shelf (MCOTS) radars for both the MRR and SRR solutions, and a combination of recapitalization and COTS\/MCOTS replacement for the Long Range SOTRs. Also, the project will conduct Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for upgrading three Long Range MOTRs."

This capability is comprised of an ATD system built for the Title 10 LFT&E environment and associated biomechanics data and analysis tools. The current manikins do not represent the modern Warrior and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with underbody blast (UBB) events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment devices are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for UBB events. The device produced by this Project will be used to satisfy a critical need for scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB."

PM CT2 will work with Blue and Red Teams to establish processes which facilitate open network tests under the red team authority, coordinate with PMs on CABT efforts on behalf of ASA ALT and report to ASA ALT on new cyber vulnerabilities. Blue teams will work cooperatively with acquisition programs to make sure all security measures are taken throughout the program's lifecycle, ensuring cyber resiliency. Blue teams are essential to help military operators assess, protect and defeat the presence of cyber security threats across Army Acquisition Programs.\n\n\nWill focus on the continuation of certifying candidate teams. The goal is to certify enough teams to allow acquisition programs the flexibility to find a certified Blue Team that meet their program's schedule and cost and can be incorporated early on in the program. CABT vulnerability assessments will provide data analytics to report trends and lessons learned. A web portal will serve as a one stop shop for both candidate and certified Blue teams to obtain and maintain their certification."

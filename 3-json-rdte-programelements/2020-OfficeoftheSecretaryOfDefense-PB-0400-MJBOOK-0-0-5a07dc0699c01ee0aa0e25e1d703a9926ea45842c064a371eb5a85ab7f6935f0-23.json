In FY 2020 all funding and appropriate project investment areas from the Quick Reaction Fund (project-code 826 within Program Element (PE) 0603826D8Z) will be incorporated into ECTD.  Additionally, in FY 2020, funding and activities for the Silent Hammer project will be incorporated into the ECTD program.  \n\nECTD funding enables project selection in the year of execution and provides leadership within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&E)) with the flexibility and agility to anticipate and quickly respond to emergent DoD issues, time-sensitive threats, and innovation opportunities.  The program collaborates with and leverages government labs, academia, and industry to execute its mission in support of the National Defense Strategy, Joint Staff, and DoD modernization priorities.  Completed ECTD projects transition to joint programs through fielded operationally relevant prototypes; technology adoption into programs of record; integration into system level, multi-year joint demonstrations; and through advanced research and engineering efforts like the Warfighting Lab Incentive Fund for further development of tactics, techniques, procedures, and concepts of operations."

            "val": "In alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element supports the USD(R&E) with experimentation and mid-term, mission-focused capability development that crosses functional domains and enhances warfighter lethality, technical superiority, adaptability, and resilience.  ECTD funding supports joint prototype development, joint experimentation for CONOPs development, and red teaming validations that enable disruptive innovation to sustain the United States' operational superiority.  Joint demonstrations and ECTD-sponsored venues of defense-wide experiments provide opportunities for emerging technologies to succeed, or fail fast.  The demonstration venues include: Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, a multi-domain venue focused on small and non-traditional businesses; Silent Hammer, an advanced electronic warfare venue that transfers to ECTD in FY 2020; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  The red teaming funding line explores vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and enables USD(R&E), and the broader defense science and technology community, to make informed decisions before investing in new capabilities.  Red teaming enables adaptation to unforeseen vulnerabilities or opportunities early in capability development when design changes are cost effective and programs can be re-directed if developmental dead ends are discovered.  ECTD prototypes, demonstrations, experimentations, and red teaming validations enable developers to showcase new and maturing capabilities in realistic environments and against realistic threats with operational user involvement.\n\nECTD prototyping projects increase the speed of technology innovation by reducing technology risk for emerging capabilities.  With an emphasis on joint and interagency partnerships, ECTD matures capability options to anticipate and inform new acquisition pathways in addition to formal requirements and acquisition processes.  Although projects are selected in the year of execution, anticipated FY 2020 technology areas include employment of directed energy from aircraft; multi-domain, autonomous learning systems; enabling technologies for missile defense; and, increased soldier lethality systems.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman\u2019s Capability Gap Assessment, and DoD modernization priorities."

These experimentation and demonstration venues support the rapid discovery and transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations.  The venues provide the DoD and interagency partners with an opportunity to identify and evaluate new and emerging technologies both from commercial and government sectors through a series of technology demonstrations, experiments, vignettes, and related activities.  The venues also offer a streamlined experimentation and demonstration process that encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter.  These engagements enable rapid innovation and adoption of new technologies to meet operational needs through the exploration of military utility, and identification of potential risks of emerging technologies. \n\nIn FY 2018, Thunderstorm, Stiletto, and other venues conducted 20 demonstration and experimentation events which featured 124 innovative technologies from focus areas including dense urban and subterranean warfare; enhanced lethality for small unit operations; tactical ISR; and, resilience for collaborative systems of networked sensors.  Seventeen of these technologies transitioned directly to DoD operational users or were leveraged by formal programs of record, including an autonomous maritime landing system for unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs); a long-range geolocation capability; and, a long-range vertical takeoff and landing fixed-wing UAV.

Red teaming helps identify unanticipated disruptive opportunities and technological dead ends.  The project supports red teaming demonstrations to stress and assess emerging systems in key areas for gaining or maintaining overmatch earlier in the life-cycle.  This project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally-representative environments and against potential threats prior to full funding commitments.  Red teaming informs requirements and helps accelerate acquisition pathways for joint missions.  The Red Teaming project supports three broad types of red teaming: 1) Red Teaming for Technology Surprise supports early stage horizon scanning and assessments of weaknesses and opportunities of pre-development technologies from an adversary perspective; 2) Prototype Development for Demonstrations and Red Teaming supports targeted, low-fidelity prototypes to assess utility and inform design choices prior to funding commitments; and 3) Red Teaming to Support Innovation in Concepts of Operations including comprehensive red teams, war games, and field experiments with maturing technology to understand how to implement new technologies and adapt to adversary responses.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of other defense red teaming organizations within the Department, the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia.  Deliverables will inform technology acquisition and new concepts of operations."

Early investigations and red teaming to identify and understand potential vulnerabilities and opportunities from emerging and conceptual technologies.  Projects will help define and anticipate impacts from new technologies to understand operational utility and identify threats from tangentially related sectors that can have significant negative impacts on current DoD investments.  2.) Maturation of Service and Defense Agency identified prototypes to enable red teaming, demonstration, experiments, and concepts of operations earlier in the development cycle.  These prototypes increase agility and rate of innovation for emerging capabilities, while reducing cost and risk.  3.) Exploring unconventional approaches to counter current Department of Defense and adversary technologies through red teams, war games, simulation exercises, and studies that employ government laboratory scientists; subject matter experts; and, students of science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines.  Red teaming events range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants.  Deliverables include characterization of future prototypes, requirement definition, recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new concepts of operations."

Potential projects include experimentation with multi-payload electric vehicles and impacts on SOF operations; squad distributed EW capabilities and weakness; fleet operations with high-bandwidth over-the-horizon networked communications; emerging near-peer counters in the areas of fully networked, smart devices; quantum sensors; weakness in integrated air defense and missile defeat; and other potential counters to future U.S. technology investments.

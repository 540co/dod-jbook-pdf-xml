The goal of the program is to provide a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment \u2013 characterized by the capacity of Department of Defense (DoD) institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, Partnership for Peace (PfP) and international partners, and other DoD educational institutions and communities. GlobalNET currently supports over 80,000 users. The program uses spiral methodology to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.\n\nThe GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), the DSCA, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD(P)), North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) Military Partnerships Directorate (MPD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners an unclassified secure platform to share information, communicate and collaborate globally 24\/7, and supports administrative activities. It provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. POCS implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure, and provides allies and partner countries the ability to team in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program. The program supports PfP coalition Initiatives through the development of distributive collaboration tools to assist U.S.\/NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities. This support is important to achieve the interoperability\/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force. POCS additionally supports internet-based education, collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements."

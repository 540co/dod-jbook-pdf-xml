            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board and investment directions as defined by Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5160.62 \"Single Manager Responsibility for Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology and Training (EODT&T)\" and approved by the DoD Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program Board (Sep 2012).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance, input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). The strategy is also based on the unique needs and capabilities identified by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the DoD EOD Program Board. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval and Joint EOD forces in the 21st century.  The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions, DoD EOD S&T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore.  Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect\/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces. Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat. Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations. Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective. Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect\/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs. This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports advanced development for battlespace shaping weapons including advanced undersea weapons.  It supports the MCM related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs). Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.\n\nThe increase in FY 2017 is due to the transfer of research efforts and activities previously conducted in the Advanced Sea Mines Future Naval Capability (FNC) effort (SHD-FY16-OSD Modular Undersea Effectors (MUSE)) from PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development to PE 0603782N Mine and Expeditionary Warfare Advanced Technology."

Another important metric is the scheduled transition of 6.3 advanced technology projects from the FNCs program into Navy and Marine Corps acquisition programs at agreed upon Technology Readiness Levels.  Technology-specific metrics include: Mine warfare data fusion capabilities yielding a 10%-25% reduction in time and risk to mine hunting activities; Mine hunting sensors - Probability of Detection = 95%, Probability of Identification of Proud Mines = 90%, Probability of Classification of Buried Mines = 80%; Unmanned Systems for MCM sized for inclusion in the Littoral Combat Ship Mine Warfare Mission Package; MCM sensors sized, packaged and capable of 12 hour missions with a search rate greater than .05 square nautical mines per hour; Mine sweeping: Modular magnetic and acoustic influence sweeping systems packaged for deployment from Unmanned Surface Vehicles; Minesweeping single sortie coverage > 9.4 square nautical miles at 20 nautical miles per hour during a 4 hour mission up to Sea State 3; Surface-laid mine and obstacle breaching capability > 90% in the Beach Zone (BZ) using unitary warheads, and > 80% in the Surf Zone (SZ)."

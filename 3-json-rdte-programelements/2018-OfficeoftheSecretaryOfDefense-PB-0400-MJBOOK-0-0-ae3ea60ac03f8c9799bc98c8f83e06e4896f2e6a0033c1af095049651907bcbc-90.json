IMD is all source intelligence derived data necessary to do the following: for weapon systems to identify and counter constantly improving threat weapons and radar systems; to optimize sensor design and validate sensor functionality; and to support system test, evaluation and deployment.  Modern weapon systems are reliant upon increasingly voluminous and precise IMD to meet performance requirements.  This demand signal for mission support data is increasing due to requirements for both analyst-evaluated, precise data and machine-processed data to be used by weapons and control systems with increasing autonomy.  This increasing requirement is highlighting the need to have a big data\/data autonomy environment to support advanced weapon systems.  In order for the community to meet modern weapons system requirements, there needs to be a measured shift with balance and attention paid to legacy and new capability needs.  There are unacceptable gaps, compounded by non-assessed program office needs and requirements that may not be obtainable; therefore, balancing supply and demand is urgently needed."

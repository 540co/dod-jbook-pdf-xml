            "val": "Intelligence Mission Data (IMD) is part of the ELINT initiative to improve overall USAF intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability through development and use of sensor data from non-ISR platforms and innovative use of sensors. This program pursues operational reconnaissance capabilities for transition through development, testing, demonstration and implementation efforts across all platforms. The IMD program objective is to provide increased battlespace awareness through the use of sensors\/platforms to achieve effects beyond what those sensor\/platforms were originally designed.  This Electronic Warfare (EW) data provides high fidelity collection on detected emissions within the electromagnetic spectrum as encountered by the platform during normal conduct of the mission.  Utilizing machine-to-machine interfaces for data transfer from platforms to ISR analysts during combat operations will provide a prime source of information when fused with other data sources and will help to resolve anomalies without degradation of the platform's EW sensor's primary mission\/function. IMD will be stored long term in the Electronic Warfare Data Management System (EWDMS) and made available to multiple customers.  This data will be used to aid in reprogramming EW sensors for increased platform survivability as well as advanced analytics for intelligence purposes."

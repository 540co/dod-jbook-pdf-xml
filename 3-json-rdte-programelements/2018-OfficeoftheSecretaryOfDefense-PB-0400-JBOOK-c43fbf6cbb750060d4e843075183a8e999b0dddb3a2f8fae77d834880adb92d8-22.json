With an emphasis on interagency and joint partnerships, ECTD develops initiatives to produce capability options that anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span one to three years, typically at a cost of less than $4.000 million, and are demonstrated and released in spirals within the project timeline.  The ECTD program focuses on rapid prototyping of emerging technologies, including electromagnetic spectrum-agile capability options; multi-domain, autonomous systems; counter-weapons of mass destruction; and dismounted soldier systems."

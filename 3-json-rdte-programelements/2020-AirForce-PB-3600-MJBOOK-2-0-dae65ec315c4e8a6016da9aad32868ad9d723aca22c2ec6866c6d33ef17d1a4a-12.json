Additionally, modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-52H weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). \n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the VLF\/LF provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.)  as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S\/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and\/or support for potential impact to VLF\/LF.  Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness."

The B-52's ATP is now capable of transmitting HD color and video at a much higher resolution than the current monochrome monitor; this upgrade will improve SA and combat lethality.\n\nCosts include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a POR and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. \n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing manufacturing and material shortage (DMSMS) issues."

The scope of work may include development of an AoA, studies and analysis, a CDD, and\/or any other analysis or documentation necessary to establish a POR. Additionally, this project may include airborne integration experiments or demonstrations of emerging technologies.\n\nB-52 AMFC Test Support (FY19 funding only)\nThe B-52 Test Support project will provide funding for the test aircraft, manpower, and facilities at the Air Force Test Center located at Edwards AFB, California. This project will support the developmental testing and sustainment needs of the B-52 weapon system.\n\nB-52 VLF\/LF Modernization (FY19 funding only)\nThe B-52 VLF\/LF Modernization integrates a receive-only, low frequency receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-52.  This project will consist of integrating an existing VLF\/LF terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). \n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the VLF\/LF provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.)  as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S\/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and\/or support for potential impact to VLF\/LF.  Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nB-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) (FY19 funding only) \nThe B-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) project consists of a monitor upgrade with a 10 gigabyte Ethernet connection. The current targeting pod display is outdated and experiencing a historic break rate. Additionally, the current monitor does not support current and emerging video resolution improvements of the fielded Sniper and LITENING ATPs. The B-52's ATP is now capable of transmitting HD color and video at a much higher resolution than the current monochrome monitor; this upgrade will improve SA and combat lethality.\n\nB-52 Infrared Missile Warning System\nThe project will complete design, integration, and testing for overseas operations for installation on the B-52.  The current missile warning system was designed in the 1970s and must be replaced to counter current and future threats.  \n\nB-52 Mission Data Recorder\nProvides permanent crash survivable flight data recorder information to meet FAA and other regulatory requirements.  Produces digital recordings enhancing aircrew mission reconstruction and release validation in AOR. \n\nCosts include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a POR and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness."

The B-52 TDL provides low latency, jam-resistant situational awareness and C2 communications needed to support in-theater operations and missions. This project will consist of integrating an existing off-the-shelf Link 16 terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antennae, and the Group B terminal, blanking unit and notch filter LRUs. The TDL terminal will be fully integrated with CONECT. This Line-of-Sight (LOS) Link 16 capability allows the warfighter to utilize this capability by maintaining situational awareness, avoiding threats, and employing an array of weapons. \n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. As the Link-16 upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security requirements (JRE messaging, crypto modernization, etc.) as well as other aircraft upgrades (1760 IWBU, Mode S\/Mode 5, IFF, BSB updates, RMP, CERP, etc.) may require study\/support for potential impact to the CONECT and Link-16 system.

Three of the CRLs were modified under EMD for test purposes. \n\nThe 1760 IWBU project is segmented into increments. Increment 1.0 provides internal and external carriage of JDAM, Laser-JDAM, JASSM, JASSM\/ER, MALD, and MALD\/J.  It consists of two sub-increments 1.1 and 1.2. This requirement's CDD was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in June 2013. \n\nThe 1760 IWBU Inc. 1.1 CDD was revalidated as a Capability Production Document (CPD) by the AFROC in February 2015; the 1760 IWBU Inc. 1.2 CPD was approved October 2018.  Development efforts for Increment 1.1 were completed in November 2015 and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in May 2016.  AFGSC declared Full Operational Capability (FOC) in June 2018.  \n\nIncrement 1.1 utilizes 44 CSRLs converted into CRLs, where three of the CRLs will be modified under EMD for test purposes.\n\nIncrement 1.2 converts 44 CRLs three of which will be modified under EMD and 76 operational B-52H aircraft plus two GITA.\n\nIncrement 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J). This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER. \n\nIncrement 1.2 completed Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in October 2015. Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted in March 2016. Milestone B approval was granted in April 2016. An Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) was conducted in May 2016, validating cost and schedule baselines. Long Lead parts approval was granted in October 2016, estimated award August 2018. In addition, a change from Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)\/Full Rate Production (FRP) to an FRP-only strategy with 2 lot buys was approved in October 2016.  Lot I\/II Approval was granted after the Milestone C Decision, November 2018.\n\nUpon completion of JASSM\/ER software development, an interim capability provided for carriage and deployment of no less than 20 JASSM\/ER [8 bay (power 4), 12 external] is planned. A combined DT\/OT validated this capability in advance of 1.2 Full System validation, and Required Assets Available (RAA) was declared September 2017.  AFGSC declared 1.2 Interim Fielding Authorization October 2017.\n\nAircraft Hardware Development: Development of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL per JASSM-ER requirements (for all 76 operational B-52H aircraft) and two GITA.\n\nSoftware Development consists of a modification to existing aircraft SMO and weapon (JASSM and MALD) OFP software to allow for internal and external carriage and modification to ground-based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).\n\nCRL Hardware Development consists of developing Group A-associated interface hardware and two Group B LRUs (power supply and power distribution box). Two CRLs were modified for Interim and three CRLs were modified for 1.2 Full system using RDT&E funds.\n\nSupport Equipment consists of developing software updates to the existing MUSTANG to interface with the CRL and the development of additional ground handling support equipment, maintenance stands.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness."

The Increment 1.1 program procured the CRL modification kits via sole source to Boeing DSS, OKC for LRIP and Full Rate Production (FRP), LRIP Installations, and FRP. Installs of the kits were completed via Contract Field Team (CFT). \n\nIncrement 1.2 Program has a sole source EMD contract to Boeing Defense, Space & Security (DSS) in Oklahoma City, OK.  Deliverables include updated JASSM and MALD weapon SMOs (software), three prototype modified CRLs, logistics support, ground and flight test support, and engineering drawings. Upon completion of JASSM\/ER OFP and SMO software coding, an interim capability of no less than 20 JASSM\/ER [8 bay (power 4), 12 external] was validated thru DT\/OT in FY17.  The 1760 IWBU Inc. 1.2 Full capability lifted the Inc. 1.2 Interim power restriction to allow for power of 8 JASSMs in the bay and integrate 8 MALD into the bay. The Increment 1.2 program will procure the CRL modification and aircraft kits for full rate production via sole source to Boeing DSS, OKC. The installs of the kits are planned to be completed via CFTs and PDM."

In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers (using stimulate\/simulate\/computer-based training or a mix) to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs. In order to assist PDM during after-install checkout and Barksdale AFB and Minot AFB units with maintenance checkout and operational training, a CONECT ground station is being developed. \n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. Funds may also be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness."

This program will replace six Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) which include combining three Circuit Cards into one Input\/Output (I\/O) CCA. The Backplane and Motherboard will require an upgrade to integrate the new CCAs: the Central Processing Unit \/ 1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics cards. The Input\/Output CCA will combine the Discrete Inputs Analog, Audio Video (DAAV), Discrete Outputs (DOA) and Serial Busses functionality. This upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU. \n\nIn addition the new GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements: Which include two Ethernet Ports and two connectors on face-plate for future growth. \n\nThe GPS IU integrates GPS Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data into navigation, communications, and weapons systems on board the B-52.  The GPS IU acts as a controller for a MIL-STD-1553 data bus communications path.  The major areas of support include GPS interface control and monitoring, targeting pod functions, navigation displays for the Pilot and Copilot stations, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) control functions.\n\nOriginally developed with a 33MHz processor with 4MB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), the GPS IU has become overloaded as more software has been added to the B-52.  Currently operating at 86% throughput capacity and at 90% memory capacity, it is projected to exceed the designated safety threshold of 95% memory load by 2018.  The GPS IU is also facing parts obsolescence issues.  Studies show that the current spares will be exhausted by 2018.  The upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU.  The modified GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements.\n\nGPS IU requires upgrading to incorporate any other GPS dependent capabilities on the B-52 platform.  B-52 fleet will have the capability to carry additional GPS dependent weapons and targeting pods, and the increased capacity to incorporate future GPS-dependent capabilities beyond 2018.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative."

The APQ-166 system will be increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the current failure rate of the APQ-166 places long-duration missions at risk. This modernization program will encompass the radar antenna array and up to 14 individual LRUs that comprise the entire radar system. Development, production and installation of new components and systems to replace the legacy equipment; to be installed on all 76 B-52H aircraft. RMP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire, to the maximum extent possible, previously developed Radar systems and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability of the radar system and the capabilities for new missions. This Radar Modernization Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons and to perform mission-essential navigation and weather avoidance functions. In addition, applicable training devices for the new radar subsystem must also be developed, modified and\/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. \n\nThis upgrade will affect all three Weapon System Trainers (WST), the WST Training Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), and both B-52 Offensive Station Maintenance Trainers (OSMT). As the RMP upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.), increased radar integration (advanced targeting pod, mission planning, open mission systems considerations, crew vehicle interfaces and Electronic Warfare System), as well as other aircraft upgrades (e.g., Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S\/Mode 5, IFF, GPS\/INS, BSB, Re-Engine, EWS, etc.) may impact the RMP. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life\/obsolete software\/hardware within the weapons system and simulators systems enabling a move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative may also be required. Additionally, funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and nuclear\/conventional mission effectiveness."

B-52 Aircrew Training Devices simulates the necessary visual, motion, and audible cues to provide ground training of Air Force Global Strike Command aircrew members. The B-52 Weapon System Trainer (WST) Air Refueling Upgrade is a comprehensive project that will allow B-52 Aircrew to accomplish credible air refueling training in the simulator, which minimizes the requirement for on-aircraft air refueling training. To facilitate this capability, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA),Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other Analysis or paperwork necessary to establish a program of record. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMSMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

The TF33-PW-103 engine is increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the AF Propulsion Directorate projects the engine will become unsustainable by 2030. This sustainment program will replace the current TF33-PW-103 engine with jet engines of similar size, weight, and thrust characteristics. The development, production and installation of new engines and related subsystems will replace the legacy equipment on all 76 B-52H aircraft. B-52 CERP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire engines and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability\/maintainability of the propulsion system and produce additional electrical power generation capabilities for emerging requirements. The B-52 CERP will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons while saving fuel and extending the range\/loiter capabilities of the aircraft. In addition, applicable training devices for the engine throttles and engine health monitoring subsystem must also be developed, modified and\/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. This upgrade will also require corresponding modification of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  As B-52 CERP brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear hardening, cyber security, program protection, etc.) will also need to be addressed.  Several concurrent aircraft upgrades during the CERP may necessitate studies be performed during the program to determine optimal engine installation and deployment options.\n\nCost includes any other analysis or documentation and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 Weapon System.  Cost includes Program Management Administration (PMA) costs, centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

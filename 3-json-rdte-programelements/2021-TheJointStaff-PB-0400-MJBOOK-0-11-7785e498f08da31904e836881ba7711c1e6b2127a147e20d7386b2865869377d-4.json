JIOR provides the capability to train and certify Cyber Mission Forces on the full spectrum of cyber weapons\/capabilities without risk of observation or fratricide. JIOR is accredited by DIA for operations at Unclassified through Top Secret-Special Compartment Information (TS-SCI) in a Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) environment. JIOR is approved for use by Special Access Programs (SAP), Special Access Required Programs (SAR), and for Special Technical Operations (STO). JIOR provides Combatant Commands, Services and Agencies (C\/S\/A's) and key allied partners the ability to test deployment and gain insights into advanced cyberspace and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities under current and future operational environments. JIOR integrates available cyberspace ranges with the training\/test communities providing access to low density\/high demand test and training resources including critical infrastructure, cyber targets, internet traffic, and opposing forces. JIOR supports Presidential policy and CJCS mandates for training, certification, and recertification of 6000+ cyber mission forces and DoD\/Interagency cyber vulnerability assessments. C\/S\/A's conduct hundreds of mission rehearsal, training, testing, and experimentation events on the JIOR annually."

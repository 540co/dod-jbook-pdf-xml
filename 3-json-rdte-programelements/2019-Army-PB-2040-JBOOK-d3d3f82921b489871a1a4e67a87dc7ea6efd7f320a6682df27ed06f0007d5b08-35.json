            "val": "Information Assurance Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)\/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.\n\nInformation Assurance Development funding implements and establishes functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and Information Assurance (IA) capabilities in coordination with the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future material solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. Develop and publish the COMSEC Implementation Planning Guidance to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of CS capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the Department of Defense (DoD) and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data in accordance with the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS, System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) for Army Capability Sets for CS\/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks. \n\nThe Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems. \n\nThe Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM program, automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution. AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute Cryptographic data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. The AKMI System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Management Client (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device Family of fill devices.  The NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program replaced NSA EKMS program. AKMI has replaced Army Key Management System.  The transition from AKMS to AKMI started in FY12.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).\n\nThe Army COMSEC program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army network (which is made up of tactical and enterprise networks). This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.\n\nEmbedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms. Tactical radios using legacy embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk.\n\nUser activity monitoring (UAM) automation\/analytics will provide technical capability to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection."

AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI) and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  AKMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  \n\nThe AKMI Program includes the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small and Medium.  AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern End Crypto Units (ECU)s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support CMI. \n\nOne of the major enhancement in the AKMI architecture is the ability to leverage the various capabilities and services from NSA KMI.  The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan\/Mission Support System (MP\/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to the tactical edge up through strategic ECU's.  The objective AKMI capabilities will be found in all of the products across the AKMI product line to include MGC, ACES and NGLD family of fill devices.  NGLD family will be an enduring solution to bridge the gap until legacy ECUs are fully modernized.  \n   \nThe NGLD Medium is reliant on the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE), a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine that is currently being developed. The KOV-21 card currently used in Army Simple Key Loader (SKL) fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK. Redesign and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated under the RESCUE program. The current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion. The follow-on RESCUE technology development will start in FY2018."

As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI by a sunset date of December 2017.  Components of the AKMI Program will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS program while others will be developed and fielded to meet AKMI requirements.  \n\nThe NGLD family of devices will become the primary Army fill devices and Tier 3 component of the AKMI Program. The NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 4QFY13. The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 2 devices (small and medium) to meet the AKMI requirements. The AKMI program has partnered with RDECOM CERDEC to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE). The Army will gain the NGLD Medium capability through the SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the RESCUE, the first iteration of the RESCUE being\nthe KOV-21 Replacement. The redesign of the current SKL cryptographic engine, the KOV-21 card, is required due to parts obsolescence and inability to be KMI Aware. The KOV-21 Replacement is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion into the SKL v3.1 which in turn meets the NGLD Medium CPD requirements. The NGLD Medium will be available in FY19. The follow-on RESCUE technology development will start in FY2019."

The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection."

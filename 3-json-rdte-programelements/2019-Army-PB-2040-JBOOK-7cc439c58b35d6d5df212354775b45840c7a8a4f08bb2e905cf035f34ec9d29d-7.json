These surety facilities maintain nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) materials and agents in order to test the effects and effectiveness of defensive or protective equipment and measures. The physical security equipment consists of concrete barriers, security fencing around test sites, cameras, gate controllers, access and intrusion detection systems, alarms, and maintenance contracts for equipment. This equipment is necessary to secure arms rooms, ammunition storage facilities, The Fast Burst Nuclear Reactor and chemical biological surety sites. Physical security equipment is critical to maintain current security requirements as outlined in AR 190-17, AR 190-59, AR 190-51, and AR 190-13."

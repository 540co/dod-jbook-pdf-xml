The increase in FY 2021 from the previous President's Budget submission is due to increased investment in WMD counterterrorism activities including the improvement of Combatant Commanders' offensive capabilities for render safe, pathway defeat, critical infrastructure defeat, and improved CWMD Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment (JIPOE) and Preparation of the Environment (PE) capabilities.  This increase also supports efforts to develop, integrate, demonstrate, and transition CWMD advanced sensors, surveillance, and defeat planning technologies in support of the warfighter.  DTRA intends to increase research and development in CWMD target assessment technologies including tools for the characterization of CWMD targets across all Combatant Commands. Additionally, DTRA realigned of the CWMD situational awareness for the CWMD Information Integration Cell (CIIC) from program element 0602718BR to better reflect the nature of this activity."

These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for countering terrorism, counterproliferation, nonproliferation, countering rogue states, and homeland defense.\n\n2.  RDT&E to systematically study signatures associated with adversary nuclear programs and nuclear detonations to gain knowledge or understanding necessary to: determine technical capabilities needed to improve DoD contingency planning activities; improve DoD situational awareness on the nuclear battlefield; and improve capabilities to attribute the source of a nuclear detonation.\n\n3.  Research and develop innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under DoD Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. System vulnerability research develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental capabilities research provides the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.\n\n4  Research and development modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions; consolidate validated modeling tools for integrated functionality; predict system responses to nuclear and radiological weapons producing electromagnetic, thermal, blast, shock, and radiation environments; provide detailed adversary nuclear infrastructure characterization to enhance counterforce operations and hazard effects; and, develop foreign nuclear weapon outputs."

In accordance with DoD Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the U.S.\n\nGovernment lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&D). As the central NTNF R&D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions. NTNF R&D supports advanced research in the following areas: (1) Prompt nuclear effects exploitation for attribution; (2) nuclear device characterization for forensics; and (3) nuclear forensic materials exploitation for attribution."

                            "val": "Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities Development encompasses the following areas.\n\n1.  Defeat Technologies develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.\n\n2.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved. Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability. Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.\n\n3.  Counter-terrorism technologies research develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent WMD threats. This research supports the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in two areas: (1) counter proliferation research is a collaborative effort to develop advanced, warfighter-unique technologies to defeat terrorist WMD development and acquisition pathways, to include defeat of the devices themselves, while minimizing risks to U.S. forces; and (2) counterterrorism concepts and technologies to integrate and synchronize activities that prevent terrorists and rogue nation states from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD. This effort supports Commander, USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.\n\n4.  Counterforce technologies research develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions capabilities to find, characterize, assess, and plan for the defeat of WMD threats. This research is focused in three areas: (1) WMD battlespace awareness provides warfighters with tools to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats; (2) weapons effects research provides modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations; and (3) innovative engineering of select promising technologies discovered under fundamental and basic research to increase the effectiveness of weapons against blast doors and other underground structures for functional defeat of Underground Facilities (UGFs), WMD, and their delivery systems.\n\n5.  DTRA provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated weapons of mass destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing. This test bed is capable of responding to operational needs outside of DTRA\u2019s research portfolio and is used by the DoD, Military Services, Combatant Commanders, and other Federal Agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional weapons, and other special weapons used against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets.\n\n6.\tTarget assessment technologies research develops, integrates, tests, demonstrates, and transitions processes and technologies providing advanced capabilities in the areas of WMD target assessment, automated advanced targeting development (A2TD), facility defeat, and full dimensional defeat. This research develops analytical tools and processes required to: (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs); and (2) assess the results of physical and functional defeat mechanisms (such as direct attack). The A2TD initiative seeks to apply emerging computer assisted technologies to automate target characterization for hard targets and WMD targets. The end result will be faster and more efficient characterization of important hard targets and WMD targets. The facility defeat project develops, validates and employs processes and software for characterization and defeat of command specified hard targets in conjunction with DIA analysis. The full dimensional defeat project aims to develop an enterprise capability for finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts. The dynamic capabilities encompassed in this effort provide Combatant Commands and the intelligence community tools and processes needed to hold at risk high value hard targets and WMD targets possessed by adversaries."

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The radiation-hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic deterrence system requirements.  The Human Survivability effort supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments. The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs."

The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and (2) to assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries."

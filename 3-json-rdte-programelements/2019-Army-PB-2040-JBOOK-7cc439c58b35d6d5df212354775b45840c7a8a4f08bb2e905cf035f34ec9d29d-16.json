            "val": "This Program Element (PE) promotes the Army's Modeling and Simulation (M&S) strategy, defined by five guiding priorities: (1) formulate Army M&S policies; (2) develop and employ management processes for models, simulations and data; (3) develop M&S standards, architectures, networks and environments; (4) develop\/employ new M&S tools and simulation technology; (5) develop an M&S workforce. Specifically, this PE focuses on priorities 3 and 4.\n\nM&S Standards, Architectures, Networks and Environments: The consistent use of standards, architectures, networks and environments advances the goal of interoperability. The Army coordinates with Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) partners along with industry and academia to develop\/employ standards that promote collaboration and facilitate the sharing of tools, data and information. The Army oversees procedures and processes for the appropriate use of standards to foster common formats and increase M&S and data reuse. The Army ensures these standards, architectures, networks and environments are readily accessible and can be reliably applied by users.\n\nM&S Tools and Simulation Technology: The Army must have credible M&S tools and data to support the full range of Army organizational missions and functional responsibilities. M&S results that are timely and credible enhance decision making. The Army must develop and accredit reliable M&S tools so that decision makers and senior leaders benefit from the results and thus support the continued development, integration and use of such tools. To ensure credibility and reliability of results, M&S managers, developers and users must make the capabilities, constraints, limitations and assumptions of their M&S tools readily accessible. PE 0605718A provides for the development and employment of tools in the form of models, simulations and data that support the full range of Army interests and deliver timely information to enhance effective decision making. Moreover, these tools can be documented, verified, validated and accredited for their intended purpose in order to provide timely, credible results."

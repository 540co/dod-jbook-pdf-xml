The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.\n\nSystems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel power\/propulsion\/propellants, unique manufacturing or assembly processes, and precision control of multi-payload systems."

The program will validate key technologies on the ground, and then fabricate an X-Plane to demonstrate: 1) 10 flights in 10 days,  2) up to Mach 10+ flight, and 3) design capable of a 10X lower cost space access for cargos from 3,000-5,000 lbs. to low earth orbit.

Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation that such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) tele-operated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment and expanding beyond pure traditional servicing functions.  The program will examine utilization of a new commercial ride-along system to GEO called Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) system, supporting small satellite delivery as well as hardware delivery for upgrading, repairing, assembling, and reconfiguring satellites.  In addition, the program will include a LEO flight experiment focused on satlets, modular building blocks for space systems, as a path of risk reduction for modular assembly on orbit.

Technologies for servicing of GEO spacecraft would involve a mix of highly automated and remotely operated (from Earth) robotic systems.

Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool\/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams.  The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer.

The program will complete a low Earth orbit (LEO) small-scale demonstration in which a commercial communications microsatellite is augmented in situ (i.e., on orbit, in flight) with an antenna that is completely fabricated in space, and will prove by computational modeling and simulation how a constellation of full-scale microsatellites with In-situ fabricated apertures may be applied to close a high-performance RF link directly to a cellular hand set in a global tactical communications network.

            "val": "Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter\u2019s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.\n\nCurrently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.\n\nDoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.\n\nThe primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:\n\nPhase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.\n\nPhase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X\/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X\/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X\/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X\/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X\/Ka capabilities across the DoD.\n\nPhase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System."

Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated through post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program\u2019s capabilities to the warfighter."

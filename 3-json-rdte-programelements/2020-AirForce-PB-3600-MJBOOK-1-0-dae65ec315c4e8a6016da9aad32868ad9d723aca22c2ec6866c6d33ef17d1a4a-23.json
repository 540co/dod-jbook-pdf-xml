As the DoD CDL EA, the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&E Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. The CDL EA develops, modifies, distributes, and maintains specifications for the CDL waveform family; ensuring design configuration control, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally, funds support managing resources allocated for development, maturation, and migration of CDL technologies.\n\nCDL EA enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to effectively utilize spectrum, use approved cryptographic equipment, and provide direct support to current operations. CDL is a vital link in DoD's existing and emerging communication architectures, providing flexibility to accommodate Command and Control (C2) data and myriad types of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Full-Motion Video (FMV) data. The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR asset operations worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point and broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users. Also, CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight.\n\nCDL EA's research and development activities support a broad array of tactical, operational, and strategic ISR users and include achieving higher data rates, open architecture development, multi- access and multi-node network management, cryptographic modernization, advancements needed to operate in contested environments, terminal and antenna design enhancements, operations in other spectral bands, and improving spectrum efficiency. Further, CDL development improves large area surveillance missions while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control (C2), plus increased ISR (C2ISR) capabilities. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future requirements documentation, program planning and execution. CDL prototype terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user.\n\nIn addition, the Cryptographic Core Modernization (CCM) thrust enables CDL to develop a miniaturized gigabit rate Communications Security (COMSEC) device capable of managing CDL data. The miniaturized COMSEC device will allow faster throughput while reducing Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $5.798 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CDL Executive Agent capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

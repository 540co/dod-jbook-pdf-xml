Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Issue Sheet #15-401-R dated 15 October 2015 for $1.2 million.  Additional $1.2 million baseline funding received May 2016 for JUONS SO-0010.\n\nSchedule: \nProject Unit 3308 \/ Technology Development:\nSoftware Release 15 added to 1Q FY16. Software Release 16 moved from 3Q FY16 to 1Q FY17 to better align with Program Related Engineering (PRE) software releases; this is reflected in the budget PE 0604270N. Software Technique Development completion moved from 4Q FY16 to 3Q FY15 to annualize effort. FY16 Software Technique Development 1Q FY16 through 3Q FY16 added to schedule. FY15 Integrated Evaluation (IE) moved from 2Q FY15 through 4Q FY15 to 1Q FY16, and reduced to a 1Q event. FY16 IE moved from 2Q FY16 through 4Q FY16 to 4Q FY16 as a 1Q event.\n \nProject Unit 3309 \/ Assault Survivability Optimization: \nFY15 CH-53E flight test delayed until August 2016 due to test range schedule (other available test ranges could not accommodate required flight test profiles). Schedule revised to include efforts to support JUONS SO-0010.  P-8A effectiveness flight test postponed due to aircraft availability. MJU-67 contract award delayed from 2Q FY16 to 4Q FY16. Test articles quantity increased from 1,500 to 1,552 to accommodated testing requirements based on FY17 test schedule.  MV-22 and UH-1Y JUONS Operational MDF delay until 3rd Quarter FY17 due to test results data review and approval process.\n\nTechnical: N\/A"

Resources will be applied to the following areas:  1) studies and evaluations to optimize current countermeasures and ASE capabilities, 2) development and demonstration of advanced expendable countermeasures and countermeasure techniques, 3) testing and evaluation of advanced countermeasures, 4) development of system software for the testing and deployment of advanced countermeasure techniques, and 5) development of and upgrades to modeling tools and specialized equipment required to conduct evaluation of advanced countermeasures.\nFY 2016 flight test effectiveness testing to be conducted using Non-Combat Expenditure Allowance (NCEA) of current countermeasures.  Advanced countermeasures procured in FY 2016 and delivered within 12 months will support flight test for optimized\/advanced countermeasures techniques in FY 2017.  The identified countermeasure quantity is required by Air Expendable Countermeasures Test and Evaluation Master Plan #1480 to complete the flight testing for test Mission Data Files (MDF) and optimized\/advanced countermeasures techniques (RDT&E Articles are advanced air expendable countermeasures)."

Advanced countermeasures procured in FY 2016 and delivered within 12 months will support flight test for optimized\/advanced countermeasure techniques in FY 2017. New advanced countermeasures are then transitioned to the Procurement of Ammunition Navy and Marine Corps appropriation for procurement and fielding. New optimized and advanced countermeasure techniques are delivered to government software support activities for fleet release to increase aircraft\/aircrew survivability."

Countermeasure Techniques developed for improved survivability are further supported by Statement of Functionality for Aircraft Survivability Equipment Smart Dispense, dated 19 January 2012.  Project Unit 3309 efforts will continue to change in response to this requirement when similar threat proliferation, advances in countermeasures technology and integrated ASE capability advancements are accomplished."

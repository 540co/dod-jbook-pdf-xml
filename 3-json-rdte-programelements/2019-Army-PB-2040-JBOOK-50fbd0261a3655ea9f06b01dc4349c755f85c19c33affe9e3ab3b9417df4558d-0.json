Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense and Space\/High Altitude capabilities.  As the Army proponent for space, high altitude and GMD, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to realize the GMD capabilities.  As the Army integrator for global missile defense, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible for reviewing programs managed by the Army, other Services, Defense agencies and National agencies to ensure that they are correctly synchronized and will ultimately provide the capabilities required by USSTRATCOM to execute its global missile defense responsibilities. \n\nProject TR5 funds United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/ Army Strategic Command (USASMDC\/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop the associated operational prototyping, experimentation, operational analysis, and modeling and simulation in support of current and future Forces."

Prototypes will be used to fully evaluate distributed cooling and legacy approaches.  c) Technology Complex Compound Materials for Thermal\/Energy Management prototypes will be manufactured and test for suitability in high velocity impacts.  The planned compound is Coordinative Molecular Bond Armor Material  and has potential to provide ballistics and thermal protection.   d) Upgrades are planned for the Advanced Measurement Optical Range facility to support laser radar development and testing."

This is accomplished by participating in and providing support to Unified Quest wargames and experiments to analyze and integrate technology to identify the feasibility integration into Army space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  The Space and Missile Defense Command will participate and support biennial rewrites of Army Capstone, Operational and Functional Concepts.  Continue to provide operational manager support to STRATCOM, NORTHCOM and SOCOM Joint Technical Capability Demonstrations to ensure Army space, missile defense, and high altitude equities are represented in advanced technology developments by demonstrating military utility when applied to military equipment and techniques.  Examples include: supporting multi service experiments and capability development of the national-directed Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as it is applied to each of the regional COCOMs; and experimenting with operationally responsive space, space control, and high altitude capabilities to ensure the broader Army enterprises can leverage the advantages of these platforms for communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), position navigation, missile warning and command and control.  Continue to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments.  Developing effective Integrated Missile Defense concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM. Will support TRADOC proponents with their responsibilities relative to doctrine, organization, training, material, leader development and education, personnel, and facilities plus related matters to continue leveraging space, missile defense, and high altitude proponent input to Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Science and Technology, Concept Development, Capability Development for Rapid Transition, and Capability Gap Analysis Army  We will sustain our core prototyping platforms, as outlined above.

Resourcing and Approval, the determination must be made as to the level of acceptable risk to be taken for each capability. These capability demands are based on Army leadership directives, written guidance, risk analysis, the Army force generation approach and input from the Combatant Commander?s Daily Operational Requirements (CCDOR). TAA builds a POM Force with which the PEGs can develop their portion of the Army?s budget. The POM Force will also determine the OF enabler support force structure and define the Generating Force (GF) necessary to support and sustain the OF capabilities directed in strategic guidance. The determination of the composition of the Army force structure, or shape, is an iterative, risk-benefit, trade-off analysis process. Capability Demand Analysis is made up of two separate events: force guidance and quantitative analysis.\n\nParticipate in the Army's FDU process The FDU Includes capabilities development, capabilities determination, requirements approval, and implementation decisions.

As part of the solution development, TRADOC CoEs force modernization proponents and non-TRADOC force management proponents consider courses of action across DOTMLPF-P with the intent of deriving materiel, personnel and organizational solutions as a last resort.

The DOD SBIR\/STTR Program funds over one billion dollars annually in mission oriented research and development (R&D) projects via small technology companies. The purpose of the program is to stimulate technological innovation, increase private sector commercialization of Federal R&D, increase small business participation in Federally funded R&D, foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation, and cultivate cooperative research & technology transfer between small business and research institutions. The SBIR\/STTR Program is codified in 15 USC 638. The SBIR\/STTR Programs competitively fund scientific and technical innovation to specifically address the mission needs of participating DOD components. \n\nDOD components participating in the SBIR and STTR Program include the: Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), Joint Science & Technology Office for Chemical & Biological Defense (CBD), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)."

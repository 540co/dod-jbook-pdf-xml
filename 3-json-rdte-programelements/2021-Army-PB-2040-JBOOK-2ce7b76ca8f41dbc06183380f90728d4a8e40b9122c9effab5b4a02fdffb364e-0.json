This PE originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, but scope was expanded to address emerging world threats. Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories (SILs) and hardware\/simulation in-the-loop facilities. These battlefield simulators represent adversary systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communications systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) in order to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems.\n\nArmy Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products developed or fielded under this PE support Army-wide, non-system-specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army\/DoD and Tri-Service capabilities to eliminate duplication of effort. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and Government Accountability Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.). Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Threat Simulator Investment Working Group."

NETT is used by TCO teams to replicate the tactics of state and non-state Threats and is supported by a robust TCO development environment. The Cyber domain is the most rapidly changing domain in which our systems operate. NETT program will continue research of these capabilities and will use an in-depth process to clean, fix, sustain, modernize, and integrate required Threat tools, tactics, and techniques that will be needed during T&E. Focus areas include: continued Threat integration, instrumentation, distributed collaboration between multiple users, targets and attack visualization, data collection and remote agent development."

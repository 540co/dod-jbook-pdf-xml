            "val": "This funding supports the Defense Readiness Reporting System, (DRRS,) the comprehensive readiness reporting system for the Department of Defense mandated under Title 10 U.S. Code.  The system measures in an objective, accurate, and timely manner the capability of the armed forces to carry out the National Security Strategy prescribed by the President, as well as the defense planning guidance provided by the Secretary of Defense and the National Military Strategy prescribed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nThe transformation of readiness reporting into a new, more comprehensive system under DRRS, presents a number of significant challenges.  Included in these challenges is the expansion in scope of the entities who can, and do report readiness, as well as what they report.  Shifting from solely resource centric readiness reporting to a mission\/capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting, but portrays a far more relevant and holistic picture of readiness.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  Additionally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs.  The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.\n\nThe realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The holistic perspective of the application necessitates its need to operate in multiple domains.  Additionally, the highly complex data structures and visualization tools needed to support the Global Force Management - Data Initiative and critical down-stream consumers of readiness information, must now be implemented within DRRS."

The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD.  This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense.  DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nDRRS expands the scope of readiness reporting within the Department to create a more comprehensive assessment of the total force and its capability to perform the tasks and missions required of it to support the National Military Strategy.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  The program is the keystone for the readiness enterprise and architected to embrace the implementation of the Global Force Management - Data Imitative (GFM-DI), allowing for the Department\u2019s efforts in the realm of Adaptive Planning and Execution to be fully supported.\n\nThe realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems.  This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish\/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS.  Through this type of advanced information environment, the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force.  This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS."

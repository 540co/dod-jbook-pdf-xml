            "val": "This Program Element (PE) funds objective vulnerability assessment products necessary for the inherently-governmental Army Test & Evaluation Command\/Army Evaluation Center (ATEC\/ AEC) mission, for the Research and Development communities as well as the Analytical communities. Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, experimenting and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest-priority Army and threat systems. Products are leveraged within the Army Futures Command and the Program Manager \/ Program Executive Office (PM\/PEO) community to exercise constructive design influence over materiel development and to provide credible engineering-level underpinning and input to the Army Analytical Community. While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this PE are also directly leveraged for urgent materiel releases and support to current operations.\n\nThis PE provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army pursues its modernization priorities and ensures readiness through the fielding of lethal and survivable systems for multi-domain operations. PE funds engineering level SLV analysis in the areas of Long Range Precision Fires systems, Next Generation Combat Vehicles, Future Vertical Lift, Network\/C3I, Air & Missile Defense, Soldier Lethality, and other highest Army priority efforts in the threat competencies of ballistics, electronic warfare, and cyber. \n\nVulnerability assessments funded by this PE are conducted across the spectrum of multi-domain battlefield threats to include: guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; cyber threats from insiders to external nation states; and directed energy weapons. Many different kinds of technical capabilities are used to generate these analyses, including specialized equipment, modeling & simulation, and experimental facilities. This PE ensures these capabilities can represent a credible live, virtual, or constructive hostile environment required for vulnerability assessment, thus enabling evaluators, developers, users, and decision makers to make informed SLV judgments for both Soldiers and materiel. These technical survivability and lethality details: enable properly informed decisions concerning acquisition and production; maximize Army overmatch in systems and tactics; inform investment priorities; and mitigate system weaknesses prior to actual combat. \n\nTechnical data and analysis results funded by this PE are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers. Central funding of this mission assures accurate and consistent treatment of survivability and lethality across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's analytical community as it conducts analyses of alternatives and other studies. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and ATEC\/AEC integrate the SLV work program into Army's formal Evaluation process to ensure ATEC can comply with its legally-mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability."

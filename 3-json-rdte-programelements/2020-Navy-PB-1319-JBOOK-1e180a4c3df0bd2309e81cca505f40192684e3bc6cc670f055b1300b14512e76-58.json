            "val": "2901 AAUSN IT\n\nThe FY2020 funding request for RDTEN Project 2901 was reduced by $3.109 million to account for the availability of prior year execution. \n\nFY20 funds transfer out from RDTEN, Information Technology Development (PE 0605013N)-$.685 million to BA04, Administration (4A1M) OMN to align funding for Information Technology (Baseline $0)\n\nDEPARTMENT OF NAVY TASKING RECORDS AND CONSOLIDATED KNOWLEDGE ENTERPRISE REPOSITORY (DoN TRACKER)\nDepartment of the Navy Tasking, Records and Consolidated Knowledge Enterprise Repository (DON TRACKER - formerly known as Enterprise Records and Task Management (ERTM)) is a single, auditable, compliant Records and Task Management process, implemented uniformly across all DON Divisions and Commands, and administered by DON\/AA, to enable efficient and effective execution of Records Management (RM) and Task Management (TM) policy in compliance with statute. DoN Tracker deployed in FY18.\n\nNMCI ENTERPRISE SERVICE TOOLS (NEST)\n\nThe NMCI Enterprise Service Tools (NEST) is the NMCI IT service management system that supports the Navy IT service lifecycle business workflow. NEST includes, the NMCI Enterprise Tool (NET) and the Requirements to Award Process Tool (RAPT), which enables and manages the business workflow. NET is a custom NET application that has been built and maintained by the DON to support ordering of IT services. RAPT manages the requirements approval process and stores supporting documentation for previously un-priced line items. RAPT provides NET with relevant identification information for the new orderable solution, which supports the creation of orderable services.  NEST serves as the single point of entry for lifecycle management of IT services on the NMCI network.\n\nThe $2.286M decrease from FY19 to FY20 is due to fewer developmental efforts. The FY20 RDTEN being requested, will be used to address minor development requirements after the NGEN-R award; and any changes in DOD\/DON procurement policies and mandates.\n\nELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM (ePS)\n\nePS provides the Department of the Navy Solution for Electronic Contract Writing replacing the existing Standard Procurement System (SPS) and DoN Integrated Contracting Environment (DICE) capabilities and deficiencies. ePS aligns Contract Writing System (CWS) with Financial Improvement Audit Readiness requirements mandated by Congress and the Department of Navy's goal for an auditable link between financial management and contract writing system.  It supports strategic sourcing and seamless exchange of data in addition to evolving to meet changing requirements. The improved capabilities will meet emerging data standards Procurement Data Standards\/Procurement Request Data Standards (PDS\/PRDS), in addition to complying with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Clause Logic Service. ePS meets the intent of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013 by providing an electronic means to award contracts.\n\nFY19 to FY20 funding increase of $31.8M is driven by a significant increase in the ePS user community via Limited Deployment (LD), Release 1 (R1), and Release 2 (R2) activities.  LD, began in FY19 and only incorporated 1 full command and 3 small sites for a total of 310 users, with 3 financial interfaces.  Release 1 will incorporate 7 full commands (including 42 sites) for a total of 3,644 users.  R1 also begins to incorporate Navy specific requirements into the gap closure, software configuration, and testing activities, and includes the development and testing of 6 additional financial interfaces.   FY20 includes LD, the majority of R1 activities, and initial data migration planning activities for R2, which is a significantly larger effort.\n\nDONAA IT \n\nThe Modernization Initiative includes multiple projects with RDT&E requirements:  Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC), Data Modernization & Analytical Tools, Knowledge Network (K-Net), Consolidated Law Enforcement Operations Center (CLEOC), and Data Modernization of the Secretariat Automated Resources Management Information System (SARMIS).  RDTEN funding will optimize DONAA's capability to make necessary improvements to various Secretariat systems.  This modernization will ensure compliance with continued financial emerging requirements.  Enhancement of financial auditability will be in compliance with DOD security system requirements.\n\nMULTIPLE THREAT ALERT CENTER (MTAC)\nThe Post-Cole Secretary of the Navy Anti-terrorism\/Force Protection Task Force identified the need for NCIS to enhance the Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC).  The MTAC provides key anti-terrorism\/force protection products in response to Fleet tasking and is critical to Fleet protection during current Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  This project provides funding for the development of an IT system to track the movement of NCIS special agents deployed in advance of DoN in-transit units.  The ability to track and communicate with these agents is necessary in order to forward threat data to those forward deployed agents and to task them to respond to emerging threats.  Funding is required for equipment and contractor support to modify COTS software.\n\nDATA MODERNIZATION & ANALYTICAL TOOLS\nNCIS data collection, filtering, and analysis infrastructure is unable to handle the increased flow of terrorism investigative and threat reporting of the Post 9\/11 era.  NCIS must revitalize its infrastructure and its data and investigation management capabilities to effectively counter current terrorist threats.  The three main components of this portfolio investment are data modernization, knowledge management, and investigation management.\n\nKNOWLEDGE NETWORK (K-Net)\nK-Net is a Data Modernization & analytical tool being developed and soon deployed that greatly enhances NCIS's technological arsenal.  K-Net implements an integrated NCIS approach for identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of NCIS's knowledge and expertise.  To that end, K-Net is a knowledge management system that improves NCIS's ability to search, analyze, fuse, and distribute both national intelligence and law enforcement information.  The envisioned end state for K-Net is a secure, intuitive, web environment that is the one stop shop where applications, data, and tools are easily accessible to all of NCIS users to effectively and securely fulfill their mission regardless of when and where they operate.\n\n\nCONSOLIDATED LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS CENTER (CLEOC)\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) enhancement of CLEOC will enable meeting Law Enforcement (LE) reporting requirements, satisfy Congressional mandates for the Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) and improve functionality across the Naval criminal justice community.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEM (DONCJIS)\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is the Executive Agent (EA) for the Department of the Navy Criminal Justice Information System (DONCJIS).  This system provides a cradle to grave criminal justice and law enforcement information system.  The system enables multiple communities within the DON to share criminal justice and law enforcement information.  Funding is required for contractor support to develop, test, train, deploy and implement this application.\n\n2903 NAVAIR IT\n\nFY2020 funding request for RDTEN Project 2903 was reduced by $0.525 million due to availability of prior year funds.\n\nConfiguration Management System (CMS) - This program was originally identified as Joint Configuration Management Information System (JCMIS) to reflect the main software tool used for component tracking and Aircraft Configuration Management. However, as the available data sources from the fleet have expanded, the new name of CMS was chosen to better acknowledge the variety of information sources which are received, integrated, and compiled to give the most accurate component record data and aircraft configuration. CMS serves as the Program of Record (POR) to manage and control Navy and Marine Corps aviation component data reconstruction efforts.  CMS compiles record data via fleet documentation of component updates and captures this information via a centrally managed database within the current software tool, Joint Configuration Management Information System (JCMIS).  CMS efficiently manages product structure data, including complex interrelationships between assemblies and subassemblies, technical documentation and the parts that comprise the item. Accurate, complete and accessible configuration data is critical to the successful operations of DoD weapon systems or tracked assets.  Mission readiness and operational capabilities are enhanced by CMS, as consistent integrated configuration data is readily available to operators, maintainers and logistics personnel. CMS provides users with a common database infrastructure to ensure compatibility, quality, and consistency of Configuration Management (CM) processes and provides configuration managers and analysts the validated CM information necessary for accurate maintenance, spare procurements, reliability and safety analysis, and mission readiness. Funding is budgeted to support the services of re-hosting and testing of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) upgrades to ensure objective performance of CMS is achieved.\n\nNavy Cybersecurity - Cyber Warfare consists of many different aspects to include sabotage of our weapon systems, networks as well as enablement of missions. Nation and non-nation state actors are acquiring and employing more advanced cyber-attacks in order to exploit our networks and aviation systems challenging our technological edge.  The threats and capabilities are real and range from exploiting capabilities, overloading weapons systems and logistics supply chains, to jamming signals or taking control of weapons systems.  We must defend against adversarial cyber attacks while contributing to the exploitation of cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nTo meet these challenges and address the Chief of Naval Operations priorities and tasking, these R&D efforts are specifically focused on Naval Air Systems Command weapon or control systems and programs to ensure warfighting effectiveness as part of integrated \/ multi-platform kill chains.  These research and development efforts will strengthen our cyber posture by developing research, development, test and evaluation capabilities and solutions to deter, detect, and mitigate cyber threats and safeguard classified naval aviation systems and platforms from \"cradle to grave.\" These solutions will be integrated into the acquisition of weapons systems to enhance security, increase lethality, and improve resiliency in the expected operational environments.  Our weapon or control systems are unique in the aforementioned environments and mission, but also in the presence of numerous non-traditional access points and trusted cyber relationships required for operational environments.\n\nDigital Thread (DT) - capability provides digital process integration with complete, secure and authoritative data. DT integrates the product life cycle, and includes all the processes that are needed to design, develop, test, produce, and support a product. Connecting these processes using standardized digital tools and data accelerates the product development cycle and lowers costs for support and new capability integration. The Digital Thread capability includes development and demonstration of cyber security architectures for sustainment information systems, and development of a digital manufacturing data architecture and repository.\n\n2904 NAVSEA IT\n\nFY2020 funding request for RDTEN Project 2904 was reduced by $6.917 million due to availability of prior year funds.\n\nThis program includes the funding for Information Technology (IT) support at NAVSEA for the development, support, and sustainment of maritime shore maintenance and includes multiple modernization efforts to insure effectiveness of Fleet maintenance systems as part of the current Navy Maritime Maintenance Enterprise Solution (NMMES).  These efforts include retirement and\/or replacement of costly legacy systems, transition planning and systems engineering for integration with national and enterprise interim and future solutions.  These efforts align with direction to insure that proposed interim solutions support a planned, single maintenance solution end state, as well as direction to align with data center consolidation plans proposed across the FYDP.  It includes the modernization of Naval Shipyard and Regional Maintenance Centers' Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) production tools.  This includes modifications\/enhancements to Shipyard IT systems, such as Advanced Industrial Management (AIM); Project Scheduling and Sequencing (PSS); Workload and Performance Systems; the COST and MAT systems, and other solutions such as the Electronic Technical Working Document (eTWD) Initiative.  The goal of PMO-IT is to provide modernization, migration and consolidation of obsolete legacy systems to the next generation of centrally hosted tools supporting Fleet Maintenance and national systems for the Navy.\n\n2905 BUPERS IT \n\nFY2020 funding request for RDTEN Project 2905 was reduced by $2.200 million due to availability of prior year funds.\n\nResearch and Development Funds for MPT&E Transformation under PE 0604703N have been consolidated within PE 0605013N PU 2905 starting in FY19.  \n\nThis effort is the linchpin of the Navy's MPT&E (Manpower, Personnel, Training & Education) business IT Transformation strategy which stems from the decision to invest in programs that directly align with the Sailor 2025 vision.  The current 70-year-old business processes and 40-year-old obsolete IT systems will not sustain Fleet anticipated growth and is not cost efficient nor effective.  The Transformation strategy involves revolutionary change by rapid implementation of MPT&E business IT products using the Industry Best Practices Model (e.g., early investment for largest ROI, rapid prototyping, and vanilla COTS products usage.) Four projects are the cornerstones of the N1 Transformation strategy.  The Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) will become Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2) and includes personnel and pay modernization and the collapse of Legacy Manpower System functionality.  Second, a Single Point of Entry (SPOE) for Sailor self-service is composed of My Navy Portal (MNP), Identity and Access Management (IdAM), a Customer Relations Management (CRM) solution, and a centralized and standardized customer service center (The My Navy Career Center (MNCC)).  Third, MPT&E Core Learning Stack improves the accessibility, sophistication, and collaborative nature of educational outreach.  Finally, the Authoritative Data Environment (ADE) will enable the collapse of 9 legacy data warehouses into a single, authoritative source of truth for Sailors and Navy decision makers.  Additionally, ADE will enable modern data analytics and business intelligence capabilities, taking advantage of current state of practice cloud services, to be leveraged in addressing the Navy's current challenges.\n\nIn FY20, there is significant investment being made to increase the scope and scale of Single Point of Entry\/My Navy Portal which will provide the Sailor with a self-service web environment.  SPOE efforts in FY20 will include development of transactional mobile applications, Identity and Access Management (IdAM) solution, and MNP integration with My Navy Career Center (MNCC).  In parallel, there is an increase scope for NP2 in the ramp up to a MPT&E Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2) system.  Transformation field test activities which began in FY18 will continue to build out, as well as prototypes, testing, integration, and migration to the cloud environment.\n\nNAVY PERSONNEL AND PAY (NP2) - The NP2 increase in FY20 supports the de-customization of the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) and integration of Direct to Treasury Pay Capability via Pay Modernization (Pay Mod).  This combined effort (named NP2) will result in an integrated, vanilla Commercial Off the Shelf, cloud hosted, integrated personnel and pay solution that will provide the navy with an IT system that is modern, highly automated, auditable, and more efficient.  FY20 efforts include:\n\n1.  Complete end-to-end Application Functional Testing (AFT) for the NP2 Rapid Prototype Pilot (RPP).\n2.  Complete Compile to Combat engagement & experimentation activities for NP2 RPP.\n3.  Complete first capability drop for NP2 RPP (Street to Fleet functionality).\n4.  Begin Rapid Fielding Pilot (RFP) #1, the scope of which will include Personnel Administration, Benefits and Pay for \"Fleet to Retirement\/Separation\", including afloat capability.\n5.  Complete Transition Plan for movement of NP2 to the commercial cloud environment.\n6.  Complete transition of NP2 from Government Cloud to the commercial cloud environment.\n7.  Complete Defense Joint Military System (DJMS) data cleansing in support of transition of Pay functionality to NP2.\n8.  Conduct deployment planning for NP2 RFP.\n9.  Conduct design and development sprints for NP2 RFP #1.\n10.  Conduct SRR\/SFR, PDR, CDR, and iterative AFT\/ASIT for NP2 RFP #1.\n11.  Begin planning activities for NP2 RFP #2, the scope of which will include Position Management, Task Analysis, and Manpower Requirements analysis.\n\nA 2015 analysis of alternatives for integration of personnel and pay capabilities recommended the use of Oracle PeopleSoft 9.2 with Global Payroll for achieving the Navy's Personnel and Pay IT needs.  Follow-on analysis conducted as part of the MPT&E transformation efforts in 2016 and 2017 indicated that the most cost effective approach to achieving the Transformation goals of modernizing HR Business System IT consistent with industry best practices was de-customization of the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) which uses Oracle PeopleSoft as its core technology, integration with Global Payroll, use of General Ledger to maximize auditability and accounting functions and hosting of the integrated solution.  This combined effort (named NP2) will result in an integrated, vanilla Commercial Off the Shelf, cloud hosted, integrated personnel and pay solution that will provide the navy with an IT system that is modern, highly automated, auditable, and more efficient.\n\nImplementation of NP2 will result in several key benefits:\n\n1.  Improved accuracy and auditability of personnel and pay transactions.\n2.  Treasury Direct Disbursing eliminating Navy reliance on the sunsetting DJMS system.\n3.  Improved permeability of Active and Reserve Components to improve accuracy and eliminate delays in pay processing when a member moves between components.\n4.  Increased automation of common personnel and pay transactions\n5.  Integration of functionality currently spread across 55 different adhoc and outdated HR Business Systems.\n\nEfforts in FY20 are focused on system development, testing and delivery of core components associated with Military Pay, Personnel Transactions that effect Pay, Auditability, Accounting, and Treasury Direct Disbursement.  Beyond F20, development will continue and will bring continued integration of legacy systems such as those used for detailing and distribution, management of Sailor performance, and talent management and matching. \nBeginning in FY20 system requirements and functionality for NMRS\/BBD\/AoA will be subsumed under the auspices of NP2 as part of the N1 MPT&E Transformation and system consolidation.  The descriptions  for those systems are provided below.\n\nBILLET BASED DISTRIBUTION (BBD)\nBBD is a Sailor 2025 initiative aimed at modernizing distribution and order writing systems.  The effort begins functional work and follow-on development to collapse Navy Reserve Order Writing System (NROWS), Navy Marine Corps Mobilization Processing System (NMCMPS), Enlisted Assignment Information System (EAIS), and Officer Assignment Information System (OAIS) into a single distribution system.  The objective of BBD is to increase personnel readiness, improve fit and provide clear visibility to the impact on mission readiness at the billet level. BBD will facilitate maximizing the contributions of every member of the Navy workforce by delivering competency-based career paths.  As part of the Navy's transformation initiative, BBD will be consolidated into the MPT&E Personnel and Pay System technology component.\n\nNAVY MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS SYSTEM (NMRS)\nNMRS will modernize obsolete software and incorporate a wide array of enhancements (expanded capabilities based on sponsor's approved Functional Requirements Document) of new capabilities in support of Manpower Requirement efficiencies.  NMRS is a key tool which Navy manpower managers rely on to set, implement, and execute manpower requirements. Recommendations for improving data bases and the Navy's mobilization capacity rely on NMRS to make strength determinations.  The planned effort also includes technical evaluation and integration of products produced by the Simulation Toolset for Analysis of Mission, Personnel and Systems (STAMPS) program.  As envisioned by the Navy's Transformation initiative, NMRS will eventually be consolidated into the MPT&E Personnel and Pay System technology component of the transformation.\n\nANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE\/ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (AOA)\nThe Navy will conduct multiple AoAs and studies to analyze viable alternatives in order to determine the most efficient and effective solution to address the modernization of elements of the Navy's Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPT&E) IT portfolio.  AOA will assess operational effectiveness, suitability, and costs of non-tactical systems to meet emerging capability requirements.  \n\n\nLEARNING STACK (FORMERLY LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - DISTANCE LEARNING (LMS-DL))\nBeginning in FY20, LMS-DL is aligned with the Learning Stack (LS) technology component of the N1 Transformation initiative.  LMS-DL supports ready relevant learning, with a focus to align Navy learning, create a career learning continuum, and leverage evolving technologies to expand learning solutions when and where the Sailor needs them. The collaborative learning environment (CLE) is a key component within the learning IT strategy that leverages Commercial-Off-the-Shelf products to integrate the CLE with intelligent tutors, a multi-purpose reconfigurable training system (MRTS), electronic classrooms (ECR), trainers and labs, interactive multimedia instruction (IMI), instructors, and a virtual environment. \n \nAs part of the Transformation holistic IT approach, ready & relevant learning requires the development of a Learning Management System that permits:\n(1) Mobile & flexible delivery of modular training to the sailor\n(2) Synchronization of work requirements with learning modules to ensure proper training is delivered at the right time\n\nFY20 funding will develop and deploy new technologies for modularized training in fleet concentration areas to support the continuum of learning to include:\n(1) Development, modification or replacement of the current LMS platform\n(2) Integration of Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPTE) management tools to support end to end business processes (billet information, assignment, distribution, student management, learning management, personnel information, advancement) that will be impacted by changes to learning delivery and career profiles via Progressive NECs (e.g. Legacy systems: TFMMS,NSIPS, Learning Assessment System, Navy Training Management Planning System and future transformation systems: NP2 and ADE.) \n\nThe Learning Management tools and supporting IT infrastructure must also be modified to support management of training into the Delayed Entry Program, the growing use of demonstration videos, social media, student and learning management for MPTE mobility efforts, gaming and simulation technology as it is brought on-line.\nLMS-DL will also introduce the Learning Continuum Pilot, a risk reduction effort that develops proof of concept alignment of sailor training requirements with learning content delivery.\n\nSINGLE POINT OF ENTRY (SPOE) (FORMERLY MY NAVY PORTAL (MNP))\nMNP is aligned with the single point of entry (SPOE) technology component of the N1  Transformation initiative. MNP is an integrated web portal that consolidates the Navy's Human Resource portals, knowledge, and applications into a single and simplified user experience.  Through the use of a multi-phased development approach, MNP will provide an intuitive self-service single point of entry (SPOE) for Sailors to view and manage their personnel and career information.   MNP provides Active and Reserve Sailors with personalized interactive experiences and allows access to relevant information including learning content, human resource applications, and career business processes.\nBeginning in FY20 system requirements and functionality for ARM will be subsumed under the auspices of SPOE as part of the N1 MPT&E Transformation and system consolidation.  The descriptions for the system is provided below.\n\nAPPLICANT RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (ARM)\nARM provides automated support of the management of recruiting information. ARM enables all levels of recruiting to have real-time access to timely and accurate information. ARM provides managers with decision-making support by consolidating Navy Recruiting Command (NRC) legacy application systems. The complete ARM Systems Dev\/Mod effort will incorporate biometrics and paperless implementation across all lines of business systems to gain additional efficiencies.  Included in the ARM program is the Self Service Accessions Application (SSAA). Phase II of this effort will build the SSAA application into the ARM system. SSAA is a mobile device-based software application. SSAA supports a change in the NRC business processes from a recruiter-driven business model to an applicant self-service business model. This \"app\" will be used by applicants to collaborate with recruiters anytime & anywhere to more efficiently and effectively navigate the recruiting process.  As envisioned by the Navy's Transformation initiative, ARM will be consolidated into the SPOE Customer Relations Management (CRM) in FY20.\n\nAUTHORITATIVE DATA ENVIRONMENT (ADE)\nADE is part of the Navy's MPT&E IT Transformation initiative aligned directly with the Authoritative Data Environment technology component of the transformation.  ADE is aimed at transitioning the current project based ADE into a full enterprise solution that is based on modern IT service models and cloud hosting technology.  This will advance data analytics and visualization capabilities, and add common platform services in a big data environment that is consistent with private industry.  This acceleration toward a true Navy-wide personnel authoritative data environment is a transformational increase in capability for decision support and improving personnel readiness.  \nAs part of the Transformation strategy, the Chief of Naval Personnel has directed expansion and improvements of the ADE in making MPT&E data more available to commanders, sailors, business owners and fleet executive leadership.  The ADE provides infrastructure, operations and sustainment of the Navy MPT&E Authoritative Data Warehouse(ADW), enterprise service bus, and web support services. \nThe capabilities delivered by this funding include:\n     (1) Completed \"golden record\" expansion increments\n          - Data quality\n          - Governance\n          - Security\n          - Data standardization\n     (2) Increased capabilities for MPT&E supply chain & business operations\n          - Data discovery\n          - Advanced visualization tools\n          - Predictive analytics\n     (3) Enhanced architecture to support unstructured data and \"big data\" analytics\n     (4) Improved support for future identity management & access for mobile device capability\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION (RMI)\nThe RMI program is a consolidation of DON risk management requirements into a single Program of Record (POR) to provide modern safety reporting and management capabilities for both active and reserve Navy and Marine Corps commands. RMI enables agile responses to business rule changes, automation of routine actions, improved data integrity, and facilitates self-service for organizations and individuals.\n\nRMI is being developed in three increments of capabilities: Streamlined Incident Reporting (SIR), Safety Program Management (SPM), and Analysis & Dissemination (A&D).  A fourth requirement, Portal  integration, will be accomplished as part of the development of the three RMI increments since each will be built on the same Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) platform.  Each of these capabilities will be acquired as individual Abbreviated Acquisition Programs using an incremental development approach for reengineered business processes, while consolidating five legacy systems Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS), Enterprise Safety Application Management Systems (ESAMS), Portsmouth Occupational Accident and Illness Reporting System (POAIRS), Medical Mishap and Compensation (MMAC), and Injury Tracker (INJTRK). \n\n3167 JOINT TECHNICAL DATA INTEGRATION (JTDI)\n\nJOINT TECHNICAL DATA INTEGRATION (JTDI)\nJoint Technical Data Integration (JTDI) Program - JTDI funding supports the evaluation, testing and integration to develop a JTDI Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solution for installation on Carrier and Amphibious Assault class ships and at other globally deployed Navy\/Marine Corp aviation activities.  JTDI is a digital technical data access, delivery and local Organizational & Intermediate level library management toolset.  It improves accuracy and timeliness of technical manual and other technical data delivery and minimizes the Fleet's library management burden.

JTDI also provides deployed maintenance personnel with 24x7 collaborative reach-back\/tele-maintenance capabilities so that Fleet Support Teams\/Engineering Technical Services can remotely diagnose problems and assist with repairs, and provides for process efficiencies to support ongoing Aviation Fleet Technical Representative reductions.\n\nMARINE AVIATION LOGISTICS ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (MAL-EIT)\nIncreased funding to accelerate the deployment of MAL-EIT 3.0 to meet the new deadline of FOC in FY19 as well as begin development of MAL-EIT 3.1.  \nFunding supports the evaluation, development, testing and integration of software and hardware solutions across all US Marine Corps Aviation activities to be used in the planning and execution of geographically distributed, expeditionary Aviation Logistics (AVLOG) chains in support of deployed USMC Air Combat Element operations.  The Marine Aviation Logistics Enterprise Information Technology (MAL-EIT) Program is one of four programs contained within the Marine Aviation Logistics Support Program (MALSP) modernization program known as MALSP II.  Legacy MALSP is nearly 25 years old and grossly inadequate in IT capability to meet the informational, planning, and C2 needs of a dynamic, geographically distributed nodal AVLOG system.  MAL-EIT is a Defense Business System Abbreviated Acquisition Program that will develop and deliver the required IT capability necessary to eliminate the IT related gaps existing in the legacy MALSP.\n\n3185 JOINT AIR LOGISTIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (JALIS)\n\nJALIS is an operational scheduling and aircraft management system that facilitates real-time data analysis.  JALIS is a critical element in the management of DoD air logistics assets.  JALIS allows:\n\n     (1) DoD Service Personnel to submit airlift requirements for DoD Personnel and cargo\n     (2) Air Logistics Flying Units to communicate their aircraft availability in a real-time graphic display\n     (3) Designated Scheduling Organizations to compare airlift requirements with available aircraft\n     (4) Designated Scheduling Organizations to create mission assignments\n\nJALIS informs applicable users of mission details and modifications by using a combination of system displays and email updates.  JALIS is geographically distributed and has a user base in excess of 4,000 members.  JALIS facilitates the movement of thousands of DoD Personnel and tons of cargo annually in support of the following:\n\n     (1) Navy Unique Fleet Essential Airlift\n     (2) Army's Operational Support Airlift Agency (OSAA)\n     (3) United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)\n     (4) United States Marine Corps (USMC)\n\n3432 NMMES-TR\n\nThe NMMES-TR is an Information Technology (IT) acquisition program that will provide a sustainable enterprise IT solution leveraging Commercial, Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology and business processes for shore maritime maintenance. Unlike the uniquely custom designed status quo toolset, the NMMES-TR solution will not implement extensive product customization to match the current maintenance business processes; but rather, maintenance business processes will be modified to match the software solution, thereby adopting industry best practices. Accordingly, the solution will be more flexible to the BPR process, and more agile to capitalize on efficiency improvement opportunities and innovations. This will facilitate alignment with the Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP) by assisting the maintenance activities with accomplishing assigned tasks as planned in order that submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface ships can properly train and deploy on schedule. NMMES-TR will also provide a modern solution that will be more effective and efficient in combating cybersecurity threats, and capable of continuous monitoring.\n\nThe NMMES-TR initiative has been a pre-acquisition Defense Business System (DBS) effort for the past three years funded through Line Item 0605013N, Project Number 2904. In April 2017, the Department approved the NMMES-TR initiative to commence as an acquisition program, resulting in the establishment of a new Project Number 3432 beginning in FY19.\n\n\n9406 MAINTENANCE DATA WAREHOUSE\n\nFY2020 funding request for RDTEN Project 9406 was reduced by $0.398 million due to availability of prior year funds.\n\nMaintenance Data Warehouse funds the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) Sustainment Vision (SV) 2020 digital transformation which is a critical component of improving readiness. It will be executed in a fully agile manner providing continuous fleet readiness improvements across the FYDP. The initial SV 2020 configuration will be supported with an agile Minimal Viable Product (MVP) as the foundation for continuous capability introduction. The Aviation Logistics Environment (ALE) will provide the seamless environment to support the integration of the other capabilities developed in Maintenance Data Warehouse. \n\n\nAviation Data Warehouse\/Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation (DECKPLATE) program is the next generation data warehouse containing over 30 years of aircraft maintenance, flight, components, and usage data. Through the use of web-based, commercial off the shelf software for data load, analysis, query, and reporting tools, the user has the capabilities to effectively obtain readiness data in a near real-time environment, as well as providing historical data for long range planning, trend and records analysis, records reconstruction, and compliance with technical directives. DECKPLATE supports the mission of the warfighter who requires a single source of near real-time aviation data in which to base critical readiness decisions. DECKPLATE collects data from authoritative sources, such as the fleet maintenance systems, into a data warehouse. Because the warfighter only needs to access one database, the time consuming task of collecting various pieces of data from various sources will be reduced and ultimately eliminated. This also accomplishes a reduction in legacy systems mandated by Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. DECKPLATE manages total inventory for two major categories of assets, Aircraft (General Equipment) and Engine\/Propulsion Systems\/Modules (EPSMs) (Operating Materials & Supply). DECKPLATE is comprised of the transactional Aircraft Inventory and Readiness Reporting (DECK-AIRRS) and the Engine Transaction Reporting (DECK-ETR) subsystems which provide the complete lifecycle for aircraft and Engine\/ Propulsion System\/Modules (EPSMs). DECKPLATE has been identified as a level 1 financial feeder system due to the value of the aircraft and EPSM's managed in the system, and continues to respond to audit compliance and Cyber Security mandates. DECKPLATE is a core feeder system to numerous NAVAIR efforts.\n\nCondition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) solution is an initiative which provides Naval Aviation Enterprise with common enabling capabilities which deliver timely data-driven, decisional information to optimize aircraft availability and materiel readiness by incorporating health and usage leading indicators into the failure mode mitigation process, enabling the Warfighter to more efficiently meet mission requirements through automated analysis and decision making processes. The CBM+ initiative increases readiness through streamlined maintenance processes which provide the sustainment base with timely, actionable logistics\/engineering data and integrated analytics not previously available, enabling engineers and acquisition professionals to support system improvements based on CBM+ acquired data and analytic results. CBM+ provides the enabling infrastructure and storage solutions within an Enterprise common environment needed to store and analyze weapon system sensor data to extend the life of current and new acquisition aircraft, realizing savings from reductions in field (organizational and intermediate) maintenance actions, reduced functional check flight hours, mishap mitigation, and reduced parts usage. \n\nThe Aviation Logistics Environment (ALE) program is the Naval Aviation Information Technology (IT) solution to deliver full lifecycle weapon system logistics and maintenance capabilities to the functional Naval Aviation Support Process (NASP).  ALE will provide a seamless digital environment that will improve readiness and provide for reduced system development, testing, deployment, and sustainment costs, as well as reduced cyber risk due to lower number of IT systems and ability to address capability gaps via an integrated technology schedule.   It will deliver these capabilities via a net centric, shared data environment that supports shore based, afloat, and expeditionary operations.  The ALE integrates IT services plane-side and interfaces with infrastructure systems where necessary. ALE is a global logistics enterprise solution and a part of the total enterprise solution architecture. ALE is designed to structure IT services with the ability to connect with other parts of the enterprise solution set, thus enabling an interoperable end-to-end business process. ALE consolidates Naval Aviation data into an integrated data environment for high level analysis. ALE will integrate, organize, and develop an underlying infrastructure and analytical capacity across the NASP in order to generate a holistic timely picture of readiness and condition for all T\/M\/S. ALE will be providing modern Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Decision Support (Predictive Analytics), Planeside Interfacing, and the Enterprise Infrastructure to support the NAE. The ALE program is a \"system of systems\" that will provide a common, integrated data environment that will enable NAE Vision 2020 data transparency across the Naval Aviation Enterprise; end-to-end process view to enable both consuming and providing on-demand information to stakeholders; a capability to view \"digital twins\" of all T\/M\/S for both allowable and as- configured states; a consolidation of aging, near-end-of-life systems and applications to modern technology and cost efficient support infrastructures; consistent and accurate weapons systems technical and Computer Aided Design (CAD) engineering documentation to support additive manufacturing capabilities; standardized metrics, algorithms, and business analysis tools; an architecture that enables migration to the cloud; and alignment to Information Assurance (IA) and Cybersecurity standards, and Risk Management Framework (RMF) compliance.  \n\nVector (formally Integrated Logistics Management System (ILSMS)) supports the development of a common logistics analytical application which uses a disciplined approach to Business Intelligence (BI) architecture by combining products, data, technology and methods aimed at key Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) business processes. Vector provides a single view of the data to focus on aircraft readiness, maintenance, supply, cost, and man-hours. Vector provides naval aviation with a common view of approved key performance metrics and the capability to perform multi-system analysis of Ready for Tasking (RFT)\/Ready Basic Aircraft (RBA) Gap drivers, 'Top-Down' aircraft systems analysis down to the component level. Vector identifies system performance trends early to mitigate future readiness and cost impacts to the fleet. \n\n-\tDynamic Scheduling optimizes aircraft (BuNo specific), engine and component maintenance through task sequencing based on reliability and failure data, and asset utilization vice calendar directed maintenance. Dynamic Scheduling will have insight to demand across the NAE and can affect maintenance across all levels of maintenance. Dynamic Scheduling IT system capability will interface with authoritative source systems providing and consuming operational demand, man power, training, supply and others. Near term Dynamic Scheduling capability is planned for NALCOMIS OOMA and future state DS capability is planned for NAMS implementation. Both material and non-material changes implemented along with the DS IT system will provide capability that overcomes the challenges faced by the as-is state to include: Advanced scheduling capabilities interfaced with current future MRO system to enable system assisted scheduling, optimization and opportunistic maintenance.\n-\tInsight and the ability to collaborate and affect schedules across all levels of maintenance and MRO systems.\n-\tCapture and analysis of RCM mitigations strategies with the ability to quickly implement changes to maintenance tasks and periodicities.\n-\tThe ability to package Technical Manuals for serial number specific, scheduled event tasks at the point of maintenance.\n-\tThe ability to provide additional point of maintenance technical data and support to enable the maintainer of the future.\n\nOptimized Scheduled Maintenance and Dynamic Scheduling IT system capabilities will contribute to the reduction of MMHs and increase in operational availability objectives by positively affecting the efficiency of maintenance at the O, I & D-Levels of maintenance across the NAE. Future state OSM IT system capability may be provided by the Aviation Logistics Environment (ALE)\/Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions. Dynamic Scheduling IT capability is schedule to be developed as an interface to NALCOMIS OOMA in FY 19 timeframe.  Future state version of Dynamic Scheduling IT capability will interoperate with Naval Aviation Maintenance System (NAMS) and other future state system such as Naval Data Repository (NDR), ALE\/PLM, and Navy Depot Management System (NDMS)."

                            "val": "DON\/AA IT Modernization (formerly AA USN IT)\n\nSYSTEM MODERNIZATION & ANALYTICAL TOOLS: The Secretariat Automated Resources Management Information System (SARMIS) is a financial tool used by the Secretariat to formulate, execute, and report changes to organizational resources. DON\/AA employs this system to support financial and resource decisions for all Secretariat activities. SARMIS produces budget materials and analysis, as well as generating allocation data. In addition, SARMIS contains organizational manpower data that assists our leaders in making necessary personnel decisions for the Secretariat. The SARMIS application is currently operating on a severely outdated and underperforming platform. This results in additional administrative overhead, error corrections, and development fixes to maintain current operations. This RDTEN funding is used to upgrade this critical software capability to a new platform, comply with mandatory DOD cyber security requirements, and develop new reporting and integration capabilities.\n\nASN(M&RA) IT System Modernization for BCNR:\nThe CAPS-II, CRSC, and BCNR programs are used by the Navy Clemency and Parole Board (NCPB), the Combat Related Special Compensation Board (CRSC), and the Board of Corrections of Naval Records (BCNR) to process and adjudicate approximately 17,200 cases per year. The current system defects have resulted in additional man-hours and reduced reporting functionality. This has created a longer manual process and hinders adequate statistical data from being retrieved. As a result, congressional inquiries take longer to satisfy and accuracy cannot be guaranteed. RDTEN funding will be used to redevelop systems for the CAPS-II, CRSC, and BCNR in order to meet reporting requirements, enhance system capabilities, and gain compliance with current IT standards.\nDON TRACKER  \n\nDepartment of the Navy Tasking, Records and Consolidated Knowledge Enterprise Repository (DON TRACKER - formerly known as Enterprise Records and Task Management (ERTM)) is a single, auditable, compliant Records and Task Management process, implemented uniformly across all DON Divisions and Commands, and administered by DON\/AA, to enable efficient and effective execution of Records Management (RM) and Task Management (TM) policy in compliance with statute.\n  \n\nELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM (ePS)\n\nThe increase from FY19 to FY20 supports completion of the Limited Deployment (LD) phase of the ePS program in addition to software hosting, gap closure and Release 1 deployment activities.  Efforts associated with completion of LD include software configuration, software installation, and test and evaluation.  Efforts associated with gap closure and Release 1 include software configuration, software installation, and data migration.\n\nThe electronic Procurement System (ePS) is the Department of the Navy's (DON) End-to-End (E2E) Contract Writing System (CWS).  It will provide the Navy and Marine Corps contracting community with a full contract writing management capability and facilitate integration with federally mandated systems, DON financial systems, and industry.  The ePS will utilize Department of Defense (DoD) standards and support auditability.  The ePS will address existing CWS challenges including outdated architecture, limited capabilities, scalability concerns, and existing legacy systems.\n\nFull deployment of the ePS ensures compliance of the DON's contracting abilities with the following legislative mandates: the writing and management of all contracts must now occur in congressionally approved computer systems (Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013); the central management and oversight of all DoD business (10 U.S. Code (U.S.C.)  Section 2222); and all contracting actions must be fully auditable and traceable (Section 1003 of the NDAA 2010 & Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance).   \n\nThe ePS will use DoD data exchange capabilities (e.g.; Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Purchase Request Data Standard (PRDS)) in order to achieve standardized data interoperability with external systems.  The Navy Enterprise Service Bus (NESB) serves as the hub to relay procurement data to various finance and other systems of record, such as Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (Navy ERP), Standard Accounting & Reporting System (STARS) and Standard Accounting Budgeting & Reporting System (SABRS). \n\nThe result of successful ePS implementation will be a contracting workforce that issues accurate and timely contracts in a standard format that comply with all DoD\/Federal laws, regulations, and policies.\n\n\nNMCI ENTERPRISE SERVICE TOOLS(NEST)\n\nThe decrease of $2.286M from FY19 to FY20 is due to fewer developmental efforts. In FY20 the RDTEN funding will be used to address minor requirements after the NGEN-R award; and any changes in DOD\/DON procurement policies and mandates.\n\nThe NMCI Enterprise Service Tools (NEST) is the NMCI IT service management system that supports the Navy IT service lifecycle business workflow. NEST includes, the NMCI Enterprise Tool (NET) and the Requirements to Award Process Tool (RAPT), which enables and manages the business workflow. NET is a custom NET application that has been built and maintained by the DON to support ordering of IT services. RAPT manages the requirements approval process and stores supporting documentation for previously un-priced line items. RAPT provides NET with relevant identification information for the new orderable solution, which supports the creation of orderable services.  NEST serves as the single point of entry for lifecycle management of IT services on the NMCI network."

This release was successfully deployed in Q2FY18.  R3.2: Successfully developed, tested, and deployed Service Delivery functionality, enabling users to create and submit delivery requests for services and accounts in a multi-vendor, multi-contract (MVMC) environment for the NGEN-R contract in Q3FY18.  R3.2A: Deployed new Self-Service Module (SSM) interface into NET and converted 216 reports from Logi Ad-Hoc to Logi SSM for users to maintain access to customized reports upon Logi conversion in FY19 as required by the vendor (Logi). This effort required communicating with the CTR community, analysis all ad-hoc reports currently in Production, and converting\/incorporating all reports into the enhanced reporting module.\n-  NET Receiving Reports\/NGEN Extension Impacts: Conducted analysis of upcoming requirements related to the NGEN extension contract and NGEN-R contract(s), including review of previously implemented functionality that may be impacted via the extension contracts and related CLIN mappings. This effort included gathering Receiving Report requirements from preliminary stakeholder sessions to prepare for upcoming functionality required for NGEN-R. This is a planned release for FY19.\n-  RAPT Releases:  \n  o  Documented and incorporated the ONE-Net Engineering Request for comment (RFC) process into NEST, enabling the ONE-Net Pilot within RAPT to integrate OCONUS requirements processing and ordering and utilize the existing NMCI RAPT Tool.  This release was deployed in Q2FY18.  \n  o  Successfully developed, tested, and deployed the following activities:  RAPT Archives, ONE-Net SI RFC workflow, and other high-priority requirements to support a MVMC environment; and Service Area alignment of RAPT requests to provide executive-level data for Enterprise Reporting. This was a release identified later in FY18 to meet an emerging PMW 205 requirement to map all requests to PMW 205 Service Areas.  \n  o  RAPT R4.0: In July 2018, began conversion of RAPT to Appian (COTS tool) for MVMC in NGEN-R.  As of Q4FY18, completed development and engineering (5 of 10) in preparation for a Q2FY19 deployment. \n-  Business Financial Management (BFM) Module Release R1.0 and R1.1: \n  o  Created customized MS Access-based solution for BFM Team. This is a Program Office Initiative that was identified later in FY18 to provide reporting and planning capabilities for leadership across PMW 205 projects and priorities. \n  o  Supported two releases and corresponding demos to support the BFM Team designing, testing, and implementing a streamlined financial spend plan tracking and planning tool. Based on frequent demos, our team worked efficiently to incorporate additional requirements requested throughout the releases. R1.0 went live on 7\/6 and R1.1 went live on 9\/15.  Thes releases included financial reports, minor change requests from Release 1.0, and provided traceability of obligation changes. \n-  Enterprise Reporting R1.0: Followed SDLC process to develop, test, and successfully deploy first NEST Enterprise Reporting application (Release 1.0 - PLC Dashboards and Self-Service Module) as a module in NEST Common Launch on 8\/10 to allow PMW 205 leadership to gather project lifecycle insights for NGEN's financial, resource, and stakeholder driven executive decision making."

During FY20, the program will complete Limited Deployment activities such as user training and data migration, and will begin the majority of Release 1 activities including interface development, gap closure activities, integration, testing, data cleansing.  Additional Release 2 (R2) data profiling activities will also begin in FY20.  Moving from LD to R1 is a significant increase in effort."

However, as the available data sources from the fleet have expanded, the new name of CMS was chosen to better acknowledge the variety of information sources which are received, integrated, and compiled to give the most accurate component record data and aircraft configuration. CMS serves as the Program of Record (POR) to manage and control Navy and Marine Corps aviation component data reconstruction efforts.  CMS compiles record data via fleet documentation of component updates and captures this information via a centrally managed database within the current software tool, Joint Configuration Management Information System (JCMIS).  CMS efficiently manages product structure data, including complex interrelationships between assemblies and subassemblies, technical documentation and the parts that comprise the item. Accurate, complete and accessible configuration data is critical to the successful operations of DoD weapon systems or tracked assets.  Mission readiness and operational capabilities are enhanced by CMS, as consistent integrated configuration data is readily available to operators, maintainers and logistics personnel. CMS provides users with a common database infrastructure to ensure compatibility, quality, and consistency of Configuration Management (CM) processes and provides configuration managers and analysts the validated CM information necessary for accurate maintenance, spare procurements, reliability and safety analysis, and mission readiness. Funding is budgeted to support the services of re-hosting and testing of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) upgrades to ensure objective performance of CMS is achieved. \n\nNavy Cybersecurity - Cyber Warfare consists of many different aspects to include sabotage of our weapon systems, networks as well as enablement of missions. Nation and non-nation state actors are acquiring and employing more advanced cyber-attacks in order to exploit our networks and aviation systems challenging our technological edge.  The threats and capabilities are real and range from exploiting capabilities, overloading weapons systems and logistics supply chains, to jamming signals or taking control of weapons systems.  We must defend against adversarial cyber attacks while contributing to the exploitation of cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nTo meet these challenges and address the Chief of Naval Operations priorities and tasking, these R&D efforts are specifically focused on Naval Air Systems Command weapon or control systems and programs to ensure warfighting effectiveness as part of integrated \/ multi-platform kill chains.  These research and development efforts will strengthen our cyber posture by developing research, development, test and evaluation capabilities and solutions to deter, detect, and mitigate cyber threats and safeguard classified naval aviation systems and platforms from \"cradle to grave.\" These solutions will be integrated into the acquisition of weapons systems to enhance security, increase lethality, and improve resiliency in the expected operational environments.  Our weapon or control systems are unique in the aforementioned environments and mission, but also in the presence of numerous non-traditional access points and trusted cyber relationships required for operational environments.\n\nDigital Thread (DT)- Capability provides digital process integration with complete, secure and authoritative data. DT integrates the product life cycle, and includes all the processes that are needed to design, develop, test, produce, and support a product. Connecting these processes using standardized digital tools and data accelerates the product development cycle and lowers costs for support and new capability integration. The Digital Thread capability includes development and demonstration of cyber security architectures for sustainment information systems, and development of a digital manufacturing data architecture and repository."

These maintenance activities support Fleet operations 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The NMMES IT solution is used by over 40,000 civilians and military who conduct over $6.5B of ships maintenance and modernization on an annual basis.  The NMMES program includes sustainment as well as multiple modernization efforts to insure the continued effectiveness of the Fleet maintenance IT toolset. These efforts consist of adding mandatory enhancements, such as Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) changes and aligning with the Standard Accounting Budget Reporting System (SABRS) system.  The NMMES program provides for software changes, retiring and\/or replacing of costly legacy systems, transition planning, and systems engineering for integration with existing and future solutions. These efforts align with direction to insure that proposed interim solutions support and facilitate the transition to the planned maintenance solution end state. This program will provide modernization, migration, testing, and consolidation of obsolete legacy systems to the next generation of centrally hosted tools supporting Fleet Maintenance systems for the Navy.\n\nThe NMMES-TR program and budget was moved to new PU 3432 within PE 0605013N starting in FY 2019 as a result of designation as a Business System Category 1 acquisition program.\n\nFunding for NMMES PU 2904 addresses critical deficiencies and minimizes the inherent risks that a catastrophic systems failure would be to fleet readiness.  The increase in funds is required to support the modernizations of products that are on outdated software and to enhance the existing applications to make them cloud capable.  It also provides for software enhancements required to make applications Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) compliant and to enable system modifications of financial feeder applications to interface with a FIAR compliant system of record.  The requirement to handle 3-D integrated product models being delivered with CVN-78, Virginia Class and Columbia Class are also driving the increase.  NAVSEA plans to execute these funds primarily through a current sustainment contract and several separate contracts through existing delivery orders to gain the specialized resources and material necessary to sustain these vital systems until spiral deployment of the NMMES Technical Refresh (TR) solution.  The Workforce Management and Financial Management systems were removed from the NMMES TR scope by the Analysis of Alternative (AoA) Preferred Alternative, and will continue operation and sustainment as part of the NMMES portfolio.  There is an overlapping period of time where both solutions are operating and requiring sustainment, hence the increase in the requested amounts for current systems and subsequent replacement system(s).  The NMMES-TR program and budget was moved to new PU 3432 starting in FY 2019 as a result of designation as a Business System Category 1 acquisition program."

Key system objectives include: 1) Standardization of the scheduling processes and tools; 2) Creation of dates for use in the NMMES project management software; 3) Generation of user and management reports covering all aspects of scheduling of a ship or submarine availability.   The current PSS application is based on a 1980s proprietary commercial product originally acquired over 25 years ago.  The application is outdated and the vendor has informed the Navy that it will no longer be supported in the near future requiring Navy to pursue an immediate upgrade to a supportable product, while not interrupted maintenance availabilities.  The product had already become increasingly difficult to maintain and with the pending loss of vendor support could lead to catastrophic system failure and loss of ability to maintain project schedules.  The PSS Upgrade will convert the system from the Robbins-Gioia CAT proprietary solution to the Robbins-Gioia Jaguar 2020 (J2020) solution and improve the web-basing of the system."

Two additional systems; 1) Performance Measurement and Control (PMC) and Quality Performance System (QPS) are interfaced with SPF to produce the staffing, planning and performance measurement analysis necessary to successfully accomplish work in navy industrial activities.   All three of these systems have known software deficiencies which limit productivity and require cumbersome manual workarounds.  Historically to effectively operate and meet mission needs, the naval shipyards and RMCs have supplemented this suite with additional local spreadsheet and databases, adding to the complexity of replacing this aging solution.  One goal of the SPF Upgrade is to eliminate these ad hoc databases and unify the solution to effectively operate in the targeted navy data center environment.\n\nThe SPF Upgrade is part of the Service Life Extension that will address the accumulation of significant problems with this system, update the software platform, provide integrated metrics capabilities across naval shipyards and include accessibility of data by planners at headquarters.  The SPF Upgrade will modernize the database architecture to provide fully functioning data warehouse environment that will eliminate the weekend long running of PMC jobs that hinders efficiency and productivity. The Upgrade will eliminate the currently required manual interfaces with other NMMES systems to produce a seamless real-time environment that can accommodate all project management metrics, as well as all ship maintenance related metrics.  Additionally, it will eliminate the manual data gathering and consolidation efforts required to produce Shipyard Interim Metrics; and eliminate the need for Headquarters and each shipyard to maintain their own unique respective standalone data files."

It consists of a family of systems and applications that are at (or nearing) their end-of-life.  These systems and applications support a workforce of over 51,000 worldwide and enable approximately $9.5B per year of maintenance and repair work.  The Workforce Management and Financial Management systems were removed from the NMMES TR scope by the Analysis of Alternative (AoA) Preferred Alternative, and will continue operation and sustainment as part of the NMMES portfolio.  The critical business processes to schedule, execute, monitor, certify work, and pay employees at each activity are codified within the Information Technology (IT) toolset; there is no manual alternative.  Annual efforts to restore the NMMES budgets to meet requirements have only been partially successful and have required multiple annual supplemental actions to address deficiencies.  The urgency to modernize these systems has grown every year as deferred upgrades and underfunded sustainment has led to the current state of the NMMES toolset. \n\nThe NMMES-TR is a pre-Milestone A acquisition program that will provide a sustainable enterprise IT solution leveraging Commercial, Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology and business processes for shore maritime maintenance, which also standardizes processes and tools.  Unlike the uniquely custom designed status quo toolset, the NMMES-TR solution will not implement product customization to match the current maintenance business processes; but rather, maintenance business processes will be modified to match the solution, thereby adopting industry best practices.  Accordingly, the solution will be more flexible to the BPR process, and more agile to capitalize on efficiency improvement opportunities and innovations.  This will facilitate alignment with the Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP) by assisting the maintenance activities with accomplishing assigned tasks as planned in order that submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface ships can properly train and deploy on schedule.  NMMES-TR will also provide a modern solution that will be more effective and efficient in combating cybersecurity threats, and capable of continuous monitoring.  The actual solution will be formed after the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)."

These systems are targeted for modernization to address the FOUR mandatory requirements: 1) meeting FISCAM and auditability requirements; 2) transitioning COST to interface with SABRS, vice STARS-FL no later than 30 September 2018; 3) both these systems are COBOL-based. COST utilizes a 1990s era Case tool (PACBASE) to generate COBOL-ready code. In 2015, vendor support for the PACBASE tool was transitioned to an IBM subsidiary in France (who in 2016 informed the Navy that support for the tool would end by 2018), hence without this tool the COST system cannot be updated and therefore must be refreshed in order to operate; and 4) the rapid increase in the cost of gaining sufficient COBOL licenses to operate these two systems in support of fleet maintenance has also created emerging execution year budget challenges for the Navy to such an extent that it is now more feasible to immediately transition these systems to a non-COBOL solution than to continue in the current licensing structure.  The Financial Technical Upgrade addresses these four urgent needs in order to continue operation of the NMMES Family of Systems beyond 2018."

MATmf provides quantitative, financial, and status information on industrial materials. It monitors the shop stores in the shipyard and assesses the direct material inventories. \nMATmf has reached end-of-life and is operating on software components that are considered obsolete.  A Service Life Extension is required to support the future capabilities (i.e. eTWD requirements), to correct sustainability issues, and to improve the ability to support current and future ships maintenance.  While the upcoming MSE releases will consolidate application databases (including MATmf into a data center environment); it does not include material integration across shipyards nor provide usable real time material information or metrics across the ship maintenance community. The MSE releases will also not convert the outdated development code, eliminate the time cumbersome manual batch processing, nor fix a host of long term shortcomings affecting the efficiency of MATmf (including long time printing limitations affecting Material Control Tags and waterfront performance).  Over the past 5 years, NAVSEA 08 and the Corporate Material Process Action Team through multiple LEAN events has identified and documented many areas in MATmf that need enhancement to improve effectiveness. Some of these requirements include:  1) the ability to allow for Fiscal Year rollover of JMLs, 2) the ability to allow redistribution of bulk receipt inspected materials to other shipyards, 3) the ability to report transactions for BP28 assets, 4) improve the ability to create efficient processes for receipt of RFI tagged material into Shop Stores, 5) improve receipt of shipyard contracts into shipyard for receipt inspection, 6) allow DLR material in Shop Stores, 7)  address transition to another handheld scanner as the current handhelds are no longer available for purchase.  These deficiencies will be addressed in the Material Management Upgrade."

                            "val": "Research and Development Funds for MPT&E Transformation under PE 0604703N have been consolidated within PE 0605013N PU 2905 starting in FY19. \n \nThis effort is the linchpin of the Navy's MPT&E (Manpower, Personnel, Training & Education) Business IT Transformation strategy which stems from the decision to invest in programs that directly align with the Sailor 2025 vision.  The current 70-year-old business processes and 40-year-old obsolete IT systems will not sustain Fleet anticipated growth and is not cost efficient nor effective.  The Transformation strategy involves revolutionary change by rapid implementation of MPT&E Business IT products using the Industry Best Practices Model (e.g., early investment for largest ROI, rapid prototyping, and vanilla COTS products usage.) Four projects are the cornerstones of the N1 Transformation strategy.  The Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) will become Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2) and includes personnel and pay modernization, a Customer Relations Management (CRM) solution, and the collapse of Legacy Manpower System functionality.  Second, a Single Point of Entry (SPOE) for Sailor self-service is composed of My Navy Portal (MNP); Mobile Applications and Services; and Identity and Access Management (IdAM).  Third, MPT&E Core Learning Stack improves the accessibility, sophistication, and collaborative nature of educational outreach.  Finally, the Authoritative Data Environment (ADE) will enable the collapse of 9 legacy data warehouses into a single, authoritative source of truth for Sailors and Navy decision makers.  Additionally, ADE will enable modern data analytics and business intelligence capabilities, taking advantage of current state of practice cloud services, to be leveraged in addressing the Navy's current challenges.\n\nNAVY PERSONNEL AND PAY (NP2) \nA 2015 analysis of alternatives for integration of personnel and pay capabilities recommended the use of Oracle PeopleSoft 9.2 with Global Payroll for achieving the Navy's Personnel and Pay IT needs.  Follow-on analysis conducted as part of the MPT&E transformation efforts in 2016 and 2017 indicated that the most cost effective approach to achieving the Transformation goals of modernizing HR Business System IT consistent with industry best practices was de-customization of the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) which uses Oracle PeopleSoft as its core technology, integration with Global Payroll, use of General Ledger to maximize auditability and accounting functions and hosting of the integrated solution.  Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2) will sustain and develop the core system of systems architecture; executing pilot programs and iterative development of capabilities for Navy's MPT&E Transformation.    \nThe NP2 increase in FY20 supports the de-customization of NSIPS and integration of Direct to Treasury Pay Capability via Pay Modernization (Pay Mod).  This combined effort (named NP2) will result in a vanilla Commercial Off the Shelf, cloud hosted, integrated personnel and pay solution that will provide the Navy with an IT system that is modern, highly automated, auditable, and more efficient.    \n1.  Complete end-to-end Application Functional Testing (AFT) for the NP2 Rapid Prototype Pilot (RPP).\n2.  Complete Compile to Combat engagement & experimentation activities for NP2 RPP.\n3.  Complete first capability drop for NP2 RPP (Street to Fleet functionality).\n4.  Begin Rapid Fielding Pilot (RFP) #1, the scope of which will include building out pay & personnel capability; interfaces and data exchanges needed for fielding; and operational testing and parallel operations, as well as training activities.  \n5.  Complete Transition Plan for movement of NP2 to the commercial cloud environment.\n6.  Complete transition of NP2 from Government Cloud to the commercial cloud environment.\n7.  Conduct Defense Joint Military System (DJMS) data cleansing in support of transition of Pay functionality to NP2.\n8.  Conduct deployment planning for NP2 RFP.\n9.  Conduct design and development sprints for NP2 RFP #1.\n10.  Conduct SRR\/SFR, PDR, CDR, and iterative AFT\/ASIT for NP2 RFP #1.\n11.  Begin planning activities for NP2 RFP #2, the scope of which will include Position Management, Task Analysis, and Manpower Requirements analysis.\n12. Realignment of NMRS and BBD functionality\/requirements to NP2 RPP.\n\nImplementation of NP2 will result in several key benefits:\n1.  Improved accuracy and auditability of personnel and pay transactions.\n2.  Treasury Direct Disbursing eliminating Navy reliance on the sunsetting DJMS system.\n3.  Improved permeability of Active and Reserve Components to improve accuracy and eliminate delays in pay processing when a member moves between components.\n4.  Increased automation of common personnel and pay transactions\n5.  Integration of functionality currently spread across 55 different adhoc and outdated HR Business Systems.\n\nEfforts in FY20 are focused on RPP that will support the remainder of Developmental Testing (including vendor support), Training and Development efforts, and Operational\/Parallel Testing with select populations in the fleet.  Simultaneously, the RFP Pilot will be occurring for the full FY20 in an Agile methodology covering requirements gathering, development, testing, and support for deployment by Jan 2021.  Beginning in FY20 system requirements and functionality for NMRS\/BBD\/AoA\/CRM\/ARM will be subsumed under the auspices of NP2 as part of the N1 MPT&E Transformation Effort and system consolidation.  The descriptions for those systems are provided below.\n\nBILLET BASED DISTRIBUTION (BBD)\nBBD is a Sailor 2025 initiative aimed at modernizing distribution and order writing systems.  The effort begins functional work and follow-on development to collapse Navy Reserve Order Writing System (NROWS), Navy Marine Corps Mobilization Processing System (NMCMPS), Enlisted Assignment Information System (EAIS), and Officer Assignment Information System (OAIS) into a single distribution system.  The objective of BBD is to increase personnel readiness, improve fit and provide clear visibility to the impact on mission readiness at the billet level. BBD will facilitate maximizing the contributions of every member of the Navy workforce by delivering competency-based career paths.  As part of the Navy's transformation initiative, BBD will be consolidated into the MPT&E Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2) System technology component of the transformation effort.\n\nNAVY MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS SYSTEM (NMRS)\nNMRS will modernize obsolete software and incorporate a wide array of enhancements (expanded capabilities based on sponsor's approved Functional Requirements Document) of new capabilities in support of Manpower Requirement efficiencies. \nNMRS is a key tool which Navy manpower managers rely on to set, implement, and execute manpower requirements. Recommendations for improving data bases and the Navy's mobilization capacity rely on NMRS to make strength determinations.  The planned effort also includes technical evaluation and integration of products produced by the Simulation Toolset for Analysis of Mission, Personnel and Systems (STAMPS) program.  As envisioned by the Navy's Transformation initiative, NMRS will eventually be consolidated into the MPT&E Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2) System technology component of the transformation effort.\n\nANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE\/ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (AOA)\nThe Navy will conduct multiple AoAs and studies to analyze viable alternatives in order to determine the most efficient and effective solution to address the modernization of elements of the Navy's Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPT&E) IT portfolio.  AOA will assess operational effectiveness, suitability, and costs of non-tactical systems to meet emerging capability requirements.  \n\nLEARNING STACK (FORMERLY LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - DISTANCE LEARNING (LMS-DL))\nBeginning in FY20, LMS-DL is aligned with the Learning Stack (LS) technology component of the N1 Transformation initiative.  LMS-DL supports ready relevant learning, with a focus to align Navy learning, create a career learning continuum, and leverage evolving technologies to expand learning solutions when and where the Sailor needs them.  This will modernize content that meets Fleet-validated learning needs, to improve Sailor performance and enhance mission readiness.  The collaborative learning environment (CLE) is a key component within the learning IT strategy that leverages Commercial-Off-the-Shelf products to integrate the CLE with intelligent tutors, a multi-purpose reconfigurable training system (MRTS), electronic classrooms (ECR), trainers and labs, interactive multimedia instruction (IMI), instructors, and a virtual environment. \n As part of the Transformation holistic IT approach, ready & relevant learning requires the development of a Learning Management System that permits:\n(1) Mobile & flexible delivery of modular training to the sailor\n(2) Synchronization of work requirements with learning modules to ensure proper training is delivered at the right time\nFY20 funding will develop and deploy new technologies for modularized training in fleet concentration areas to support the continuum of learning to include:\n(1) Development, modification or replacement of the current LMS platform\n(2) Integration of Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPT&E) management tools to support end to end business processes (billet information, assignment, distribution, student management, learning management, personnel information, advancement) that will be impacted by changes to learning delivery and career profiles via Progressive NECs (e.g. Legacy systems: TFMMS,NSIPS, Learning Assessment System, Navy Training Management Planning System and future transformation systems: NP2 and ADE.) \nThe Learning Management tools and supporting IT infrastructure must also be modified to support management of training into the Delayed Entry Program, the growing use of demonstration videos, social media, student and learning management for MPT&E mobility efforts, gaming and simulation technology as it is brought on-line.\nLMS-DL will also introduce the Learning Continuum Pilot, a risk reduction effort that develops proof of concept alignment of sailor training requirements with learning content delivery.\n\nSINGLE POINT OF ENTRY (SPOE) (FORMERLY MY NAVY PORTAL (MNP))\nSPOE is an integrated web portal that consolidates the Navy's Human Resource portals, knowledge, and applications into a single and simplified user experience.  Through the use of a multi-phased development approach, SPOE will provide an intuitive self-service capability for Sailors to view and manage their personnel and career information.   SPOE provides Active and Reserve Sailors with personalized interactive experiences and allows access to relevant information including learning content, human resource applications, and career business processes.\nFY20 will support the following new efforts:  \n1.\tNew challenges within technical development including transactional mobile applications\n2.\tDevelopment and production of commercial cloud based Identity and Access Management (IdAM) services\n3.\tMore robust level-of-effort requirement for cybersecurity\n4.\tSystem and services integration - integration with My Navy Career Center, CRM solution, IdAM, Mobile Apps, and legacy systems\n\nAPPLICANT RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (ARM)\nARM provides automated support of the management of recruiting information. ARM enables all levels of recruiting to have real-time access to timely and accurate information. ARM provides managers with decision-making support by consolidating Navy Recruiting Command (NRC) legacy application systems. The complete ARM Systems Dev\/Mod effort will incorporate biometrics and paperless implementation across all lines of business systems to gain additional efficiencies.  Included in the ARM program is the Self Service Accessions Application (SSAA). Phase II of this effort will build the SSAA application into the ARM system. SSAA is a mobile device-based software application. SSAA supports a change in the NRC business processes from a recruiter-driven business model to an applicant self-service business model. This \"app\" will be used by applicants to collaborate with recruiters anytime & anywhere to more efficiently and effectively navigate the recruiting process.  As envisioned by the Navy's Transformation initiative, ARM will be consolidated into the NP2 Customer Relations Management (CRM) in FY20.\n\nAUTHORITATIVE DATA ENVIRONMENT (ADE)\nADE is part of the Navy's MPT&E IT Transformation initiative aligned directly with the Authoritative Data Environment technology component of the transformation effort.  ADE is aimed at transitioning the current project based ADE into a full enterprise solution that is based on modern IT service models and cloud hosting technology.  This will advance data analytics and visualization capabilities, and add common platform services in a big data environment that is consistent with private industry.  This acceleration toward a true Navy-wide personnel authoritative data environment is a transformational increase in capability for decision support and improving personnel readiness.  \nAs part of the Transformation strategy, the Chief of Naval Personnel has directed expansion and improvements of the ADE in making MPT&E data more available to commanders, sailors, business owners and fleet executive leadership.  The ADE provides infrastructure, operations and sustainment of the Navy MPT&E Authoritative Data Warehouse(ADW), enterprise service bus, and web support services. \nThe capabilities delivered by this funding include:\n     (1) Completed \"golden record\" expansion increments\n          - Data quality\n          - Governance\n          - Security\n          - Data standardization\n     (2) Increased capabilities for MPT&E supply chain & business operations\n          - Data discovery\n          - Advanced visualization tools\n          - Predictive analytics\n     (3) Enhanced architecture to support unstructured data and \"big data\" analytics\n     (4) Improved support for future identity management & access for mobile device capability\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION (RMI)\nThe RMI program is a consolidation of DON risk management requirements into a single Program of Record (POR) to provide modern safety reporting and management capabilities for both active and reserve Navy and Marine Corps commands. RMI enables agile responses to business rule changes, automation of routine actions, improved data integrity, and facilitates self-service for organizations and individuals.\nRMI is being developed in three increments of capabilities: Streamlined Incident Reporting (SIR), Safety Program Management (SPM), and Analysis & Dissemination (A&D).  A fourth requirement, Portal  integration, will be accomplished as part of the development of the three RMI increments since each will be built on the same Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) platform.  Each of these capabilities will be acquired as individual Abbreviated Acquisition Programs using an incremental development approach for reengineered business processes, while consolidating five legacy systems Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS), Enterprise Safety Application Management Systems (ESAMS), Portsmouth Occupational Accident and Illness Reporting System (POAIRS), Medical Mishap and Compensation (MMAC), and Injury Tracker (INJTRK)."

Support development and execution of cyber security documentation, reviews, and processes in support of MPT&E Transformation's Authority to Proceed (ATP) process, NAO's Risk Management Framework (RMF) Authority to Operate (ATO) process, and additional technical system modernization to meet current cyber security requirements\n4. Continue evolving MNP into a Single Point of Entry (SPOE) as a key component of MPT&E's Transformation efforts.  Providing direct integration for Sailors between various MPT&E capabilities allows for a more seamless interaction and lowers the overarching IT footprint.  Integration efforts will also necessitate an electronic interface with the My Navy Career Center (MNCC).\n5. Advance integration of portal Career Life Event (CLE) portlet capabilities for Sailors to manage their careers in an intuitive self-service web environment.\n6. Plan system consolidations in order to streamline MPT&E applications and capabilities. System integrations require new MNP development\/modernization code builds to enable MNP to successfully partner with them.\n7. Continue migration of MNP from a government cloud hosting platform to a commercial cloud hosting solution.\n8. Continue developing mobile applications as a key component of OPNAV N1s Sailor Self Service capabilities.  This will include the need for additional software that provides high levels of encryption, in addition to device operating system protections and verifications.  \n9. Ensure compliance with National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Protection Profiles through software and testing tools in order to meet leading mobile security protocols and standards\n10. Partner with OPNAV N1 to integrate and serve as a key platform to support the MNCC and My Navy Self Support Services."

NP2 will develop and deploy modernizations, enhancements, and integration of products towards an objective capability focused on Navy personnel process standardization, authoritative data, and a central personnel and pay service delivery model to achieve CNP's transformation goal.  \n\nIn FY20, the funding increase is due to the overlap of two large scale pilots for NP2 (RPP & RFP). Rapid Pilot Prototype (RPP) funding will support the remainder of Developmental Testing (including Vendor support), Training and Deployment efforts, and Operational\/ Parallel Testing with select populations in the fleet.  Simultaneously, the Rapid Fielding Pilot (RFP) will be occurring for the full FY20 in an Agile methodology covering Requirements gathering, Development, Testing, and support for Deployment by Jan 2021.  \n1.  RPP will use a rapid prototype approach to deliver pilot for PeopleSoft pay capability; build and demonstrate in production-like environment; delivery of \"field-able\" capability in the Government Cloud Environment.  Maximize use of PeopleSoft 9.2 Human Capital Management (HCM) out of the box and leverage Field Test 1 build.\nSupport Treasury Direct Disbursing (TDD) capabilities including testing and validation of a bi-directional interface with Treasury.  Generate pay file to Global Exchange (GEX). Integration testing for RPP. \n2.  RFP will design, build and test sprint cycle for residual Pay & Personnel capability.  In addition to build out interfaces and data exchanges needed for fielding; Operational Testing and parallel operations, as well as training activities.\n\nSPOE - Increase of $28.3M.  The increase in funding of $28.3M from FY19 ($11.1M to $39.5M) to FY20 can directly be attributed to the increase in scope and scale in which the Single Point of Entry (SPOE) program line is executing against. Increased efforts are directly attributed to:  \n1.  New challenges within technical development including transactional mobile applications\n2.  Development and production of commercial cloud based Identity and Access Management (IdAM) services\n3.  More robust level-of-effort requirement for cybersecurity\n4.  System and services integration - integration with My Navy Career Center, CRM solution, IdAM, Mobile Apps, and legacy systems\n\n\nRMI - Increase of $5.9M.  Funding increase from FY19 to FY20 associated with the following requirements:\n1.  Analysis and Dissemination Development, Modernization, and Integration.  Funding to execute A\/D mission of providing actionable information to reduce safety incidents.  Without the support of more sophisticated analytics to include predictive analytics, Navy will not be able to employ more predictive capabilities to improve safety across the DON in alignment with the SECNAV Strategic Readiness Review.  \n2.  Safety Program Management Development and Modernization - Develop and Deploy Safety Program Management functionality.  RMI is developing an SPM capability that replaces legacy systems and modernizes interface and capabilities.  Both initiatives consolidate safety systems, makes it easier to report mishaps, and provides authoritative data to help improve safety conditions."

JTDI is a digital technical data access, delivery and local Organizational & Intermediate level library management toolset.  It improves accuracy and timeliness of technical manual and other technical data delivery and minimizes the Fleet's library management burden. JTDI reduces maintenance work hours with a savings Return on Investment of 2.5:1. JTDI also provides deployed maintenance personnel with 24x7 collaborative reach-back\/tele-maintenance capabilities so that Fleet Support Teams\/Engineering Technical Services can remotely diagnose problems and assist with repairs, and provides for process efficiencies to support ongoing Aviation Fleet Technical Representative reductions.\n\nMarine Aviation Logistics Enterprise Information Technology (MAL-EIT) - MAL-EIT funding supports the evaluation, development, testing and integration of software and hardware solutions across all US Marine Corps Aviation activities to be used in the planning and execution of geographically distributed, expeditionary Aviation Logistics (AVLOG) chains in support of deployed USMC Air Combat Element operations.  The MAL-EIT Program is one of four programs contained within the Marine Aviation Logistics Support Program (MALSP) modernization program known as MALSP II.  Legacy MALSP is nearly 25 years old and grossly inadequate in IT capability to meet the informational, planning, and C2 needs of a dynamic, geographically distributed nodal AVLOG system. MAL-EIT is a Defense Business System Abbreviated Acquisition Program that will develop and deliver the required IT capability necessary to eliminate the IT related gaps existing in the legacy MALSP.  MAL-EIT is a family of IT solutions to be developed and delivered in three increments.  These increments are depicted below:\n\nExpeditionary Pack Up Kit (EPUK): Provides Expeditionary Supply Operations to include business administration, inventory, and customer service operations.\n\nNext Generation Buffer Management System: Provides buffer management in a time domain, and buffer sizing analysis.\n\nLogistics Planning Tool and Optimizer Tool: Provides capability to develop tailored Remote Expeditionary Support Packages, consumption forecasts, and Nodal Logistics Lay down designs."

The NMMES and NMMES-TR projects complement each other to provide both sustainment of the existing systems and the initial system design, development, and migration to a cloud-based commercial solution.  Both programs are essential to build the integrated environment so the existing applications can transition to the follow-on technical refresh replacement solution."

Unlike the uniquely custom designed status quo toolset, the NMMES-TR solution will not implement extensive product customization to match the current maintenance business processes; but rather, maintenance business processes will be modified to match the software solution, thereby adopting industry best practices.  Accordingly, the solution will be more flexible to the BPR process, and more agile to capitalize on efficiency improvement opportunities and innovations.  This will facilitate alignment with the Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP) by assisting the maintenance activities with accomplishing assigned tasks as planned in order that submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface ships can properly train and deploy on schedule.  NMMES-TR will also provide a modern solution that will be more effective and efficient in combating cybersecurity threats, and capable of continuous monitoring.\n\nThe NMMES-TR initiative has been a pre-acquisition Defense Business System (DBS) effort for the past three years funded Line Item 0605013N, Project Number 2904.  In April 2017, the Department approved the NMMES-TR initiative to commence as an acquisition program, resulting in the establishment of a new Project Number 3432 beginning in FY19. \n\nIn FY18, the program began working toward the award of a System Integrator contract.  Major milestones in FY18 include completion of Gates 3 and 4.  Gate 5 is scheduled for Q2 FY19 to be followed by an Acquisition Authority to Proceed to release the Request for Proposal.  The program office also conducted a review of the schedule in response to the 19 month schedule risk identified by NCCA during the Gate 4 Cost Review Board (CRB) and formalized in the approved Component Cost Position (CCP) dated 12 Apr 2018.  After careful review of the scheduled activities, the timeline for Increment 1 and the total program were increased by a combined total of 14 months to mitigate the stated risk.\n\nThe FY19 funding increase reflects a risk reduction effort to award a contract to provide a Cloud-based Capability Integration Platform (CIP) environment similar to what will be used to integrate core NMMES financial management, human capital management, digital shipbuilding environment, and the cloud-based COTS solution that provides the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and Portfolio and Project Management (PPM) functionality in support of the Shore Maritime Maintenance community mission.  Additionally, FY19 supports higher levels of effort associated with inherently Governmental efforts (i.e. contracting, acquisition planning & source selection, financial and business management, engineering, testing, logistics, etc.), and Contractor Support Services (i.e. systems engineering, organizational change management, logistics, deployment support, training, etc.).  These activities support the award of the System Integrator contract planned for Q2 FY20 following a competitive source selection.  \n\nThe FY20 funding increase reflects the award of a single prime System Integrator contract and a MAC award for all commercial items including cloud hosting, integration environment layers, business applications, and other commercial items during Q2.  The SI and the MAC vendors will begin the requirements and design review of the NMMES-TR solution to support a Critical Design Review scheduled for FY21 Q1.\n\nThe NMMES-TR program office is staffed by government personnel from NAVSEA and SPAWAR SYSCOMS and their supporting Warfare\/Systems Centers on a reimbursable basis.  Based on a cross-SYSCOM Operating Agreement, the FY19 budget includes funding for inherently governmental efforts in the following functional areas:\na.\tSPAWAR HQ: Contracting, Legal, Engineering and Cybersecurity\nb.\tSPAWAR Systems Center Atlantic: Engineering and Acquisition\nc.\tNWSC Dahlgren Division: Program Cost Estimating and Analysis\nd.\tNaval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC): Acquisition, Financial and Business Management, Testing and Logistics"

The operational availability SPM measures the degree to which a system can be supported both in terms of its inherent design characteristics of reliability, availability, maintainability, and operational effectiveness, and the efficacy of the various elements of product support, tools, and training. NMMES-TR will provide a supportable framework with a direct focus on COTS.\n\nSPM 1.1 Reliability - Reliability represents the probability the system will operate without failure over a specified period of time. Reliability accounts for Unscheduled Maintenance.\t\n\n   Mission Critical Functions Threshold\n     99.5% at LD ATP\n     99.9% at FD ATP\n\n   Mission Critical Functions Objective\n     97.8% At LD ATP\n     99.9% at FD ATP\n\nSPM 1.2 Availability - This represents the ability of an end user to access and use the service provided by the system. A Consumer Facing availability requirement is a promise to consumers that they will be able to use the service a certain percentage of time.  Availability downtime includes both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance.  NMMES-TR must be operationally available to support the maritime maintenance mission. \t\n\n   Mission Critical Functions Threshold\n     AO > 86.2% at LD ATP\n     AO > 96.6% at FD ATP\n   \t\n   Mission Critical Functions Objective\n     AO > 98.3% at LD ATP\n     AO > 99.3% at FD ATP\n  \nSPM 1.3 Maintainability - The system's ability to be retained in, or restored to, a specified condition when maintenance is performed by personnel with a specified skill, using prescribed procedures and resources, and at each prescribed level of maintenance and repair. Mean time to repair (MTTR) is a basic technical measure of maintainability. The service may be made unavailable for scheduled maintenance, as long as schedule maintenance intervals last no longer than four hours and occur no more frequently than once per month.\t\n\n   Mission Critical Functions Threshold\n     MTTR < or equal to 6 hrs at LD ATP\n     MTTR < or equal to 2 hrs at FD\tATP\n\n   Mission Critical Functions Objective\n     MTTR < or equal to 4 hrs at LD ATP\n     MTTR < or equal to 1 hrs at FD ATP\n\t\t\nSPM 2.0 SCALABILITY: \nScalability is defined as the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to enlarge to accommodate growth. NMMES-TR must be able to support enterprise level usage above 51,000 users worldwide with 25,000 concurrent users. NMMES-TR will also provide scheduling, monitoring, and tracking (SMT) of an upwards of 300,000 individual tasks within a single project for a single site (public NSY or RMC). The dynamic usage solutions will also have the capacity to scale down based on user demand, reducing system resource demand when the high volume is not required. Elastic provisioning and service management targets real end users and mission needs for functionality as the services evolve over time.\n\nSPM 2.1 Dynamic Users - NMMES-TR must be able to support enterprise level usage of at least 51,000 users NMMES-TR must be designed to support user growth. \t\n\n   User Accounts Threshold\n     > 10,000 at LD ATP\n     > 51,000 at FD ATP\n\t\n   User Accounts Objective\n     > 20,000 at LD ATP\n     > 55,000 at FD ATP\n\nSPM 2.2 Concurrent Users - NMMES-TR must support concurrent users without degradation in System Response Time.\n\t\n   Threshold:  > 50% of total users \t\n   Objective:  > 75% of total users\n\nSPM 2.3 Resources\/Project SMT Capacity - NMMES-TR must support scheduling and critical chain project management tracking of at least 300,000 individual tasks within a single project for a single site (public NSY or RMC).  NMMES-TR must be capable of providing a 50% surge in the level of user accounts.\t\n\n   Project Tasks Threshold\n     > 75,000 Activity Tasks per Project at LD ATP and > or equal to 100,000 Activity Tasks per Project at FD ATP\n     > 150,000 Detail Level Tasks per Project at LD ATP and > or equal to 400,000 Detail Level Tasks per Project at FD ATP\n     > or equal to 75% Surge Capacity in Level of User Growth at LD ATP and FD ATP\n\n   Project Tasks Objective\n     > or equal to 100,000 Activity Tasks per Project at LD ATP and FD ATP\n     > or equal to 400,000 Detail level Tasks per Project at LD ATP and FD ATP\n     > or equal to 75% Surge capacity in Level of User Growth at LD ATP and FD ATP"

JAG\/Naval Legal Service Command (NLSC) currently has one hosted business system named the JAG Enterprise System (JES.)   The JES hardware and virtual servers are hosted in the Navy Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) data center on Quantico, VA.  The hardware servers are at end of life and require replacement or virtualization, the software is outdated and requires upgrading, and NCIS requires that JAG seek another hosting platform outside of the NCIS datacenter by 2020.  The office of the Judge Advocate General adjudicates a large volume of Claims, Reports and other pertinent Legal documentation which needs to be maintained and accessed quickly.\n\t\t\t\nThe JES replacement solution will modernize and automate six crucial functions of the JAG\/NLSC organizations:\n  \n1.\tTort Claims (including Admiralty)\n2.\tMedical Claims\n3.\tPersonal & Property Claims\n4.\tInvestigations\n5.\tJAG Recruiting and Accessions \n6.\tLegal Assistance\n\nDetailed module information and their function\n\n1) The Claims and Investigations Module:  The Claims and Tort Litigation Division (Code 15) has worldwide responsibility for processing different types of claims under various statutes and regulations. Code 15 utilizes JES to process approximately 45,000 claims each year, with claims paid and recovered totaling $60-$70 million. Code 15 is also the custodian and designated release authority for all command investigations convened pursuant to Chapter II of the Manual of the Judge Advocate General conducted prior to December 1995, and all litigation report investigations. These records are all stored in JES.  Code 15 is not the custodian or release authority for command investigations convened after December 1995 nor investigations involving breaches of classified information or information security regulations maintained by the Chief of Naval Operations.\n\n2) The Recruiting and Accessions Module:  Military Personnel (Code 61) utilizes JES to evaluate applicant qualifications for selection to participate in the Judge Advocate General Corps (JAGC); to evaluate applicant performance in the JAGC internship\/externship program; to evaluate and improve the JAGC application and selection process; to conduct statistical analysis for internal management purposes; to manage the officers of the JAGC since the Judge Advocate General is statutorily required to make a recommendation on the assignment of all active-duty JAGC officers; to determine qualifications of an officer to receive a JAGC designation and to be certified as a trial or defense counsel; to determine the rotation dates and release from active-duty dates of JAGC officers, as well as the date new officers will be available for duty; to prepare JAGC strength plans for submission to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations; and to obtain an officer's preference for duty assignment, as well as eligibility for consideration for postgraduate education and overseas assignments. Certain information is promulgated to all active-duty JAGC officers in an annual publication known as the Directory of Navy Judge Advocates. The information is promulgated in the directory for general informational purposes within the JAGC, including provision of position (billet) availability information to officers contemplating rotation. \n\n3) The Legal Assistance Module:  Formerly embedded in the Court Martial Tracking and Information System (CMTIS), this module enables Legal Assistance to track the time attorneys and support staff spend on the legal services they provide.  It also provides Legal Assistance the ability to conduct client conflict checks before providing their services. The remaining data in CMTIS will be archived to provide historical data and is not part of the scope.\n\nMicrosoft Azure Services, Dynamics 365 and PowerBI as Software as a Service (SaaS) would be utilized to replace the functionality found in the JAG Enterprise System (JES) currently hosted in the NCIS Data Center on Quantico, VA.  The migration of JES will eliminate the need to maintain the physical and virtual server environment that JES currently operates on.  Dynamics 365's strong out-of-the-box case management capabilities and client management capabilities gives JAG an opportunity to modernize business processes. JAG estimates that Dynamics 365 and PowerBI will be able to support 85% of the requirements with out-of-the box functionality and configuration alone. Minimal customization should be required. Replacing JES with a Dynamics 365 and PowerBI based solution will not only improve JAG's operational efficiency, insights, and agility, but will also provide an integrated, agile, and highly secure platform for future military justice capabilities."

                            "val": "Maintenance Data Warehouse funds the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) Sustainment Vision (SV) 2020 digital transformation which is a critical component of improving readiness. It will be executed in a fully agile manner providing continuous fleet readiness improvements across the FYDP. The initial SV 2020 configuration will be supported with an agile Minimal Viable Product (MVP) as the foundation for continuous capability introduction. The Aviation Logistics Environment (ALE) will provide the seamless environment to support the integration of the other capabilities developed in Maintenance Data Warehouse. \n\n\nAviation Data Warehouse\/Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation (DECKPLATE) program is the next generation data warehouse containing over 30 years of aircraft maintenance, flight, components, and usage data. Through the use of web-based, commercial off the shelf software for data load, analysis, query, and reporting tools, the user has the capabilities to effectively obtain readiness data in a near real-time environment, as well as providing historical data for long range planning, trend and records analysis, records reconstruction, and compliance with technical directives. DECKPLATE supports the mission of the warfighter who requires a single source of near real-time aviation data in which to base critical readiness decisions. DECKPLATE collects data from authoritative sources, such as the fleet maintenance systems, into a data warehouse. Because the warfighter only needs to access one database, the time consuming task of collecting various pieces of data from various sources will be reduced and ultimately eliminated. This also accomplishes a reduction in legacy systems mandated by Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. DECKPLATE manages total inventory for two major categories of assets, Aircraft (General Equipment) and Engine\/Propulsion Systems\/Modules (EPSMs) (Operating Materials & Supply). DECKPLATE is comprised of the transactional Aircraft Inventory and Readiness Reporting (DECK-AIRRS) and the Engine Transaction Reporting (DECK-ETR) subsystems which provide the complete lifecycle for aircraft and Engine\/ Propulsion System\/Modules (EPSMs). DECKPLATE has been identified as a level 1 financial feeder system due to the value of the aircraft and EPSM's managed in the system, and continues to respond to audit compliance and Cyber Security mandates. DECKPLATE is a core feeder system to numerous NAVAIR efforts.\n\nCondition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) solution is an initiative which provides Naval Aviation Enterprise with common enabling capabilities which deliver timely data-driven, decisional information to optimize aircraft availability and materiel readiness by incorporating health and usage leading indicators into the failure mode mitigation process, enabling the Warfighter to more efficiently meet mission requirements through automated analysis and decision making processes. The CBM+ initiative increases readiness through streamlined maintenance processes which provide the sustainment base with timely, actionable logistics\/engineering data and integrated analytics not previously available, enabling engineers and acquisition professionals to support system improvements based on CBM+ acquired data and analytic results. CBM+ provides the enabling infrastructure and storage solutions within an Enterprise common environment needed to store and analyze weapon system sensor data to extend the life of current and new acquisition aircraft, realizing savings from reductions in field (organizational and intermediate) maintenance actions, reduced functional check flight hours, mishap mitigation, and reduced parts usage. \n\nThe Aviation Logistics Environment (ALE) program is the Naval Aviation Information Technology (IT) solution to deliver full lifecycle weapon system logistics and maintenance capabilities to the functional Naval Aviation Support Process (NASP).  ALE will provide a seamless digital environment that will improve readiness and provide for reduced system development, testing, deployment, and sustainment costs, as well as reduced cyber risk due to lower number of IT systems and ability to address capability gaps via an integrated technology schedule.   It will deliver these capabilities via a net centric, shared data environment that supports shore based, afloat, and expeditionary operations.  The ALE integrates IT services plane-side and interfaces with infrastructure systems where necessary. ALE is a global logistics enterprise solution and a part of the total enterprise solution architecture. ALE is designed to structure IT services with the ability to connect with other parts of the enterprise solution set, thus enabling an interoperable end-to-end business process. ALE consolidates Naval Aviation data into an integrated data environment for high level analysis. ALE will integrate, organize, and develop an underlying infrastructure and analytical capacity across the NASP in order to generate a holistic timely picture of readiness and condition for all T\/M\/S. ALE will be providing modern Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Decision Support (Predictive Analytics), Planeside Interfacing, and the Enterprise Infrastructure to support the NAE. The ALE program is a \"system of systems\" that will provide a common, integrated data environment that will enable NAE Vision 2020 data transparency across the Naval Aviation Enterprise; end-to-end process view to enable both consuming and providing on-demand information to stakeholders; a capability to view \"digital twins\" of all T\/M\/S for both allowable and as- configured states; a consolidation of aging, near-end-of-life systems and applications to modern technology and cost efficient support infrastructures; consistent and accurate weapons systems technical and Computer Aided Design (CAD) engineering documentation to support additive manufacturing capabilities; standardized metrics, algorithms, and business analysis tools; an architecture that enables migration to the cloud; and alignment to Information Assurance (IA) and Cybersecurity standards, and Risk Management Framework (RMF) compliance.  \n\nVector (formally Integrated Logistics Management System (ILSMS)) supports the development of a common logistics analytical application which uses a disciplined approach to Business Intelligence (BI) architecture by combining products, data, technology and methods aimed at key Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) business processes. Vector provides a single view of the data to focus on aircraft readiness, maintenance, supply, cost, and man-hours. Vector provides naval aviation with a common view of  approved key performance metrics and the capability to perform multi-system analysis of Ready for Tasking (RFT)\/Ready Basic Aircraft (RBA) Gap drivers, 'Top-Down' aircraft systems analysis down to the component level. Vector identifies system performance trends early to mitigate future readiness and cost impacts to the fleet. \n\nDynamic Scheduling optimizes aircraft (BuNo specific), engine and component maintenance through task sequencing based on reliability and failure data, and asset utilization vice calendar directed maintenance. Dynamic Scheduling will have insight to demand across the NAE and can affect maintenance across all levels of maintenance. Dynamic Scheduling IT system capability will interface with authoritative source systems providing and consuming operational demand, man power, training, supply and others. Near term Dynamic Scheduling capability is planned for NALCOMIS OOMA and future state DS capability is planned for NAMS implementation. Both material and non-material changes implemented along with the DS IT system will provide capability that overcomes the challenges faced by the as-is state to include:\n.Advanced scheduling capabilities interfaced with current future MRO system to enable system assisted scheduling, optimization and opportunistic maintenance.\n.Insight and the ability to collaborate and affect schedules across all levels of maintenance and MRO systems.\n.Capture and analysis of RCM mitigations strategies with the ability to quickly implement changes to maintenance tasks and periodicities.\n.The ability to package Technical Manuals for serial number specific, scheduled event tasks at the point of maintenance.\n.The ability to provide additional point of maintenance technical data and support to enable the maintainer of the future.\n\nOptimized Scheduled Maintenance and Dynamic Scheduling IT system capabilities will contribute to the reduction of MMHs and increase in operational availability objectives by positively affecting the efficiency of maintenance at the O, I & D-Levels of maintenance across the NAE. Future state OSM IT system capability may be provided by the Aviation Logistics Environment (ALE)\/Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions. Dynamic Scheduling IT capability is schedule to be developed as an interface to NALCOMIS OOMA .  Future state version of Dynamic Scheduling IT capability will interoperate with Naval Aviation Maintenance System (NAMS) and other future state system such as Naval Data Repository (NDR), ALE\/PLM, and Navy Depot Management System (NDMS)."

The ALE program was able to accomplish document preparation, acquisition strategy for contracting, and initial base lining of the requirements documents.  Initiation of the common ground station prototype for various T\/M\/S commenced along with the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) for ALE modernization as the solution set to support the NAE and additive manufacturing in FY19. FY19 efforts will be solidifying requirements, development of documentation to support the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) and Vision 2020, and prototyping the base capabilities to support the Vision 2020 program schedule. The Aviation Logistics Environment (ALE) program will start modernizing existing software that will be maintained as part of the enterprise set of tools. ALE will be supporting the Digital Warfare Office (DWO) readiness initiatives by beginning the development of necessary IT tools, processes, and a common ground station. ALE will begin the development of an integrated data environment, and the determination of a Product Lifecycle Management solution set to support the NAE and additive manufacturing."

The CBM+ Initiative increases readiness through streamlined maintenance processes which provide actionable logistics\/engineering data and integrated analytics not previously available, enabling engineers and acquisition professionals to support system improvements based on CBM+ acquired data and analytic results. CBM+ provides the enabling infrastructure and storage solutions within an Enterprise common environment needed to store and analyze weapon system sensor data to extend the life of current and new acquisition aircraft, realizing savings from reductions in field (organizational and intermediate) maintenance actions, reduced functional check flight hours, mishap mitigation, and reduced parts usage.\n\n\nPRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT (PLM):\nThis program includes funding to support Information Technology (IT) Rationalization and Product Lifecycle Management migration efforts to modernize NAVSEA's Technical Data, Configuration and Logistics IT systems. This will enable advanced warfighter readiness capabilities in accordance with OPNAV N4's Digital Transformation Vision.  This IT solution will be used by over 40,000 civilian and military personnel, impacting a yearly $6.5B investment in product sustainment.  The absence of a centrally sponsored PLM with a commonly defined and enforced system and data architecture has resulted in a proliferation of unique non-standardized, non-integrated, stove-piped IT solutions across the Navy, all supporting singular logistics functions and none able to influence warfighter readiness holistically. To enable enterprise readiness analytics, this effort will eliminate stove-piped legacy logistics IT applications and in place field an NAVSEA PLM capability that enables programs to acquire and manage product support data\/information within a single, structured, authoritative product data environment linking material readiness outcomes to the Program's core systems engineering processes. The key enabling construct of the PLM is a digital thread\/digital twin capability which provides a formal framework for controlled interplay of authoritative technical and as-built data with the ability to access, integrate, transform and analyze data throughout the product lifecycle into actionable information. Moreover as these capabilities mature, the cost of readiness becomes significantly more affordable and combat logistics operations become significantly more effective. As the Navy realizes these outcomes, Enterprise Digital Logistics IT services effectively become combat multipliers. The most significant benefit being that they maximize the effectiveness of our warfighters as we deliver them right data, at the right time, so they can continuously make the right decision faster than the enemy."

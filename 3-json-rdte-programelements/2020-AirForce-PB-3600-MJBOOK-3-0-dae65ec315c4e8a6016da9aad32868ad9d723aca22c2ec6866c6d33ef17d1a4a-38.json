            "val": "The C-5M operates across the entire range of military operations. It is the only aircraft capable of carrying 100% of certified air-transportable cargo and includes a dedicated passenger compartment enabling commanders to have troops and their equipment arrive in an area of operation simultaneously when national security concerns demand fast force closure. C-5M missions include strategic airlift of cargo and passengers as well as emergency aeromedical evacuation (AE). The aircraft must perform these missions throughout the worldwide air traffic control environment with the proper equipment to operate in FAA\/ICAO controlled airspace. Additionally, C-5M aircraft must operate at night, in adverse weather conditions, and in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (excluding electromagnetic pulse in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversights Council (JROC) approved\/validated the C-5 RERP ORD 14 Aug 01, see Appendix B, Ref YY, page 11, para 4.3.1), and High Explosive (CBRNE) environments.\n\nC-5M communication, navigation, surveillance\/air traffic management (CNS\/ATM) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate CNS\/ATM system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5M to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5M CNS\/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5M. CNS\/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.\n\nThe C-5M core mission computer (CMC)\/weather radar (WxR) program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and WxR. This effort centers around modifying the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity\/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading module cards and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development. Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf weather radar. Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5M lavatory system.\nExamples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.\n\nC-5M Replace Multi-function Controls and Displays (RMCD) program helps to maintain aircraft availability and increased situational awareness though a new Multi Function Display Unit (MFDU)replace the current 20+ year MFDU design; current equipment is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Additionally, a charging solution for the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) will provide complementary situational awareness for operational mission support. The current generation of displays and controls supporting services used on the C-5M will no longer be repairable beginning in 2022 for MFDU. Without this modification, the C-5M will be unable to support the National Defense Strategy, AF Strategic Master Plan, Geographical Combatant Command Operational Plans.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5M weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F and 605833F.\n\nAvailable funds will be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The C-5M RMCD program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification. The purpose of the program is to identify a suitable charging solution for Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), and replacement\/alternatives to the existing multi-function control display unit (MCDU) and multi-function display unit (MFDU) LRUs while maintaining existing interfaces to legacy equipment and providing for future growth opportunities. Operational Flight Programs (OFP) updates\/aggregation are required to support the latest aircraft display technologies and will be designed to ensure seamless integration into the platform.  Aircraft wiring will be replaced\/upgraded as required. Use of mixed displays (current and new) is not permissible due to human factors considerations. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.\n\nThe RMCD program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current control and display units. This effort centers around modifying the current display units to obtain sufficient capacity\/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading displays and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development, including addition of a charging solution for EFB. This modification may include software non-recurring engineering (NRE), data, cyber security, testing, installation, spares, systems integration lab (SIL), Interim Contractor Support (ICS), program support, etc.\n\nThe modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new multifunctional controls and displays replaces the current controls and displays, which are experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues. Failure to upgrade the displays to support aircraft availability will create a significant operational impact to the support of Geographic Combatant Command (GCCs) and maintaining U.S. National objectives. Further, Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5M weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F and 0605898F.\n\nAvailable funds may be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc."

This effort modifies the current CMC to obtain sufficient capacity\/capability to support integration of the WxRadar with margin for growth to accommodate future requirements.  This includes requirements to meet calendar year 2020 FAA Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) requirements.  Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5M lavatory system.  Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.\n\nThe CMC\/WxRadar modification is necessary to keep the C-5M worldwide deployable. This effort replaces the APS-133 WxRadar, resolving severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues, using the Rockwell Collins WXR-2100 commercial off-the-shelf WxRadar, which is common to other aircraft platforms, and provides the same capability as the APS-133.  The effort also replaces the current core processing module (CPM) cards in the CMC with new Honeywell CPM II cards, providing additional processing speed and throughput capacity.\n\nThe CMC\/WxRadar program is the baseline for all future modifications to the C-5M. The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the current APS-133 WxRadar and current CPM cards are both facing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues. Failure to upgrade the WxRadar and CMC to support calendar year 2020 CNS\/ATM mandates and a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact. \n\nAvailable funds will be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc."

The sole-source contract is predominately CPIF (Cost Plus Incentive Fee) with some FFP (Firm Fixed Price) elements.\n\nMission Systems Equipment program: The mission systems equipment redesign requires RDT&E funding for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) proofing. Funds are required for validation and verification of the lavatory design and installation. The Mission Systems Equipment contract method was competitive through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Wyle Science, Technical, and Engineering Group was the selected source, and the contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)."

Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5M CNS\/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5M. CNS\/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.\n\nThe current ARC-210 radio for VHF voice communications is facing diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) supply issues and additionally will no longer be capable of providing secure voice communications due to the development of new crypto algorithms. Addition of next generation ARC-210 radios with embedded Integrated Waveform (IW) and Second-generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO (SATURN) and associated cryptologic equipment will enable the C-5M to meet NSA mandates for secure communications and allow aircrews to continue to communicate securely over VHF, UHF, HF, or MILSATCOM.\n\nThe current generation of satellites that support services used on the C-5M to provide oceanic controller\/pilot data link communications (CPDLCs) to air traffic control and aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) beyond-line-of-sight command and control messages will no longer be functional after 2016. The next generation of satellites will accommodate legacy C-5M SATCOM equipment for an interim period of time to allow for integration of upgraded SATCOM equipment compatible with this satellite constellation. Without this modification, the C-5M will be unable to fly oceanic tracks and will not be able to meet aircraft separation distance requirements for civil airspace access.\n\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of air traffic control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning. ADS-B Out will allow aircraft to provide continuous broadcast of aircraft position to both controllers and other aircraft equipped with ADS-B In capable avionics. International mandates for ADS-B Out for civil airspace access call for equipage by 2020.\n\nAvailable funds will be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5M weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F and 605833F."

The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure CNS\/ATM equipment, develop software, test and integrate those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft.  The equipment integration will require RDT&E funding for commercial off-the-shelf and non-developmental item proofing."

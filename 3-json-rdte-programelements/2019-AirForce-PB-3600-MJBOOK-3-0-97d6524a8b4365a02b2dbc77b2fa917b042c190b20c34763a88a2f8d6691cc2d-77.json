LTRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB\/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA. LTRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests.  LTRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely; together with national security space launch capability, LTRS provides assured access to space for the nation.  The ER and WR are designated as Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB).\n\nLTRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data.  The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing & Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.\n\nAs aging range systems exhibit decreasing reliability, leading to higher operations and maintenance costs and increasing the risk of launch delays, the Air Force requires RDT&E funds to conduct architecture analyses to optimize investment planning for safety of flight (such as the use of drones, high definition optics, phased-array radars etc.) and commercial launch.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver LTRS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program activity is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

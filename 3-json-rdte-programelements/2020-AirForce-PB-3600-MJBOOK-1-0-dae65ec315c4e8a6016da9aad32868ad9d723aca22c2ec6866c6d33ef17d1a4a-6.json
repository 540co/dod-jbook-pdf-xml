This program is maturing fuel efficient adaptive engine component technologies and reducing associated risk in preparation for next-generation propulsion system development for multiple combat aircraft applications. Adaptive engine technology enables next generation combat aircraft capabilities by combining the efficiency of high bypass turbofans used by commercial airlines with the performance demanded of military fighter engines. This technology has undergone initial development under the auspices of the Air Force Research Laboratory through the Adaptive Engine Technology and Adaptive Engine Technology Demonstrator programs.\n\nThe Advanced Engine Development program element is new for FY 2019. In FY 2019, the entirety of this program was transferred from PE 0604858F, Tech Transition Program, to PE 0604004F, Advanced Engine Development, Project 643608, Advanced Engine Dev, in order to provide increased transparency to Congress on Air Force prototyping activities as directed in the Defense Appropriations Act 2019. This is an administrative realignment only and is not a new start.\n\nIn addition, this program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver advanced engine capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

By producing flight-weight prototypes, the program will demonstrate adaptive engine technology can be scaled to meet military fighter engine size requirements, while ensuring appropriate manufacturing- and technology-readiness levels. By performing sea-level, altitude, and durability assessments across multiple power settings, the prototype engines will demonstrate fuel efficiency increases, thrust increases, and new component technologies. These assessments will provide data to quantify the capability and reduce risk in areas such as thermal capacity, reliability, and supportability, among others.\n\nIn FY 2018, this work was performed under PE 0604858F, Tech Transition Program, Project 645351, Prototyping, Adaptive Engine Transition Program effort."

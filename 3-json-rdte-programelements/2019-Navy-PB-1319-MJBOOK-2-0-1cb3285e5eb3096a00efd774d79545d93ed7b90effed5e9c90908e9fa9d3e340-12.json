            "val": "The mission of the AH-1 attack helicopter is to provide rotary wing close air support, anti-armor, armed escort, armed\/visual reconnaissance, survivability enhancements, and fire support coordination capabilities under day\/night and adverse weather conditions.  The mission of the UH-1 utility helicopter is to provide command and control and combat assault support under day\/night and adverse weather conditions and special operations support; supporting arms coordination and aeromedical evacuation. Major modifications for both aircraft include 37 AH-1Ws converted to AH-1Zs, build 152 new AH-1Zs, remanufacture ten (10) H-1N helicopters and build 150 new UH-1Y models.  AH-1Z and UH-1Y models include a 4-bladed, composite rotor system with semi-automatic bladefold, performance-matched transmissions, T700 Engine Digital Electronic Control Units, 4-bladed tail rotors and drive systems, more effective stabilizers, upgraded landing gear, and common, fully integrated cockpits and avionics systems.  These upgrades add 10,000 flight hours to AH-1Z\/UH-1Y airframes. The fully integrated cockpits reduce operator workload and improve situational awareness, thus increasing safety and reducing the rate of aircraft attrition.  They provide considerable growth potential for future weapon systems and avionics to significantly increase mission effectiveness and survivability.  The cockpits also include integration of onboard mission planning, communications, digital fire control, self-navigation, night navigation\/targeting, air-to-ground missile and air-launched intercept missile weapon systems management in nearly identical crew stations, which significantly reduces training requirements.  These upgrades maximize commonality between the two aircraft and provide needed improvements in crew and passenger survivability, payload, power available, endurance, range, airspeed, maneuverability and supportability.\n\nThis budget is required for follow-on improvements to H-1 aircraft via integration of sensors and weapons, avionics, and air vehicle components that will address deficiencies, systems safety, obsolescence, readiness, reliability, supportability, and relevance in the battlespace. Improvements will include all associated System Configuration Set (SCS) updates as well as integration and testing related to the aircraft platforms."

This includes integrating Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P), Full Motion Video (FMV), Degraded Visual Environment (DVE), Helmet Mounted Display improvements, cockpit displays, precision and GPS non-precision landing capability, Crash Survivable Flight Incident Recorder, collision avoidance, improved Embedded Global Positioning System (EGI), Inertial Navigation System (INS), targeting sensor systems and mission computer.  H-1 capability improvements include improved Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE),  digital operations & transfer of data, digital interoperability, digital video recording, video and data networking, and information integration with aviation combat elements and Marine Air Ground Task Force elements.  Mandated capability efforts include - Communications, Navigation and Surveillance system\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM),  Required Navigation Performance\/Area Navigation (RNP\/RNAV), GPS Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), Crash Survivable Flight Incident Recorder, development efforts required for Depot standup and incorporation of technology and information protection\/Information Assurance in critical avionics and sensor systems.  In addition, the goal is to reduce total ownership cost for H-1 aircraft and related support systems by improving reliability and maintainability of critical flight and avionics systems along with associated peculiar avionics support equipment and  incorporating fact-of-life obsolescence solutions. All avionics improvements include related System Configuration Set (SCS) development updates and testing.\n\nSensors, Weapons and Helmet Mounted Display System improvements include, manufacturing process improvements, hardware and software redesign to improve reliability, improve production methodologies, implement program security initiatives and increase the collective capability to address emerging battlefield threats.   These improvements also address reliability and obsolescence, which collectively enhance Fleet readiness. The technical interface between the aircraft sensor, helmet and weapons is increasingly challenging to effectively employ advanced precision guided weapons and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) for the interface between the sensors, helmet and precision guided munitions.  These systems require extensive software and hardware upgrades that translate into meaningful, sensor fusion based solutions, to provide both battlefield and situational awareness to the H1 platform. Specifically, the AN\/ALQ-30 Target Sight System (TSS) will implement several block upgrade efforts with improvements to the IR Pointer, Laser and Cameras as well as adding capabilities such as Laser Spot Tracker and High Definition Video.  The Optimized TopOwl (OTO) optics upgrades, reliability, additive manufacturing initiatives, will address multiple human factor improvements, to include Degraded Visual Environment (DVE), as well as advanced boresighting and mapping improvements to improve weapons accuracy.  The Digital Interoperability of the Helmet and Sensor will extend to improvements in ASE and Smart Dispense Technologies to improve aircraft survivability.  Radar and Missile Warning improvements, including APR-39D(V)2 and the Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasures (DAIRCM), require extensive integration and testing.  Development, test and integration efforts with the Advanced Precision Kill Weapons (APKWS), M299 Launcher improvements, Digital Rocket Launcher (DRL), AIM-9X, the AN\/ALQ-231 (V) Intrepid Tiger II Electronic Warfare Pod and the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) Hellfire missile will follow in FY18. Improving and integrating weapon systems will align with these upgrades to improve the overall accuracy, lethality and survivability of the H1 platform. \n\nThese improvements will provide considerable growth potential for future weapon systems, air vehicle improvements, software improvements, and avionics upgrades, which will significantly increase mission effectiveness & survivability, while potentially reducing life cycle costs.  The cockpits will also include integration of onboard mission planning, communications, digital fire control, self-navigation, night navigation\/targeting, precision guided munitions, and air-launched intercept missile weapon systems management in nearly identical crew stations, which significantly reduce training requirements.  These upgrades maximize commonality between all H-1 Type\/Model\/Series aircraft and provide needed improvements in crew and passenger reliability, survivability, payload, power available, endurance, range, airspeed, maneuverability and supportability."

The SSAEM program provides the acquisition, development and launch\/on-orbit support of 18 space\/terrestrial weather sensors to COSMIC-2 partnership in coordination with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO). COSMIC-2 is launching six satellites in an equatorial, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with 3 SSAEM sensors in each spacecraft by FY 2019. The sensor types are Tri-Global Navigation Satellite System (Tri-GNSS) Radio occultation System (TGRS), Ion Velocity Meter (IVM) and Radio Frequency Beacon (RFB). The SSAEM sensors will address three distinct Joint Requirement Oversight Committee (JROC)-approved Category A weather gaps, specifically Gap #4 (Ionospheric Density), Gap #7 (Equatorial Ionospheric Scintillation) and Gap #12 (Electric Field), to provide additional space meteorological data to improve forecast capabilities and improve warfighter navigation\/communication capabilities.\n          \n          Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n          \n          This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WSF weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n          \n          This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

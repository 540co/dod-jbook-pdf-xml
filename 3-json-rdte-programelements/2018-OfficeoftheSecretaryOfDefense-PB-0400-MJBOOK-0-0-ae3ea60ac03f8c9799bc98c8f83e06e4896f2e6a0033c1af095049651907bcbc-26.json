            "val": "Software is a key to meeting the Department of Defense's (DoD\u2019s) increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution. Reliance on software-intensive mobile and net-based products and systems has increased (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the January 2017 Defense Science Board Report, \u201cDefense Research Enterprise Assessment,\u201d software, autonomy, and cyber are today\u2019s core challenges. With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  \n\nThe Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI\u2019s program of work coordinates across the DoD through Reliance 21, the overarching framework of the DoD\u2019s Science and Technology (S&T) joint planning and coordination process.  This PE benefits every Community of Interest (COI) to some degree due to the ubiquitous nature of software, but particularly benefits: Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) which includes a computing and software sub-panel; Autonomy; Cyber; and Engineered Resilient Systems.  \n\nSoftware is more pervasive than ever, and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  To address this, the PE funds research and development within the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).\n\nThe SEI FFRDC is the DoD\u2019s primary source for software research and development.  It is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering, management, and security discipline to software acquisition, development, and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs."

The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management. \n\nThis program has two main research thrusts with known military applications: 1) Software Engineering, Systems Verification and Validation, and Mission Assurance (formerly Mission Assurance) and 2) Information Assurance and Cyber Security.\n\nSEI research focuses on the most significant and pervasive software and cybersecurity challenges within the DoD, such as the scalability and reliability of software assurance, supply chain risk management, validation of and trust in autonomous systems, human-computer and human-technology interaction, computing and communication at the tactical edge, and efficiency and performance of acquisition strategies and software development appropriate for a contested cyber environment."

Algorithms must be trusted and effective in the presence of adversaries. This thrust seeks to defend against and minimize the impacts of information falsification attacks. Additionally, this thrust seeks to increase the security of network-centric autonomous systems. These systems are currently developed with a focus on function rather than security, which makes them particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks."

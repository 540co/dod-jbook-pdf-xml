PRC2 provides an adaptive and networked system, delivering timely situational awareness information supporting personnel accountability and recovery mission management worldwide.  PRC2\ndelivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and  integrated set of capabilities to prevent, prepare for and respond to joint\/coalition military personnel recovery activities, and civilian rescue missions.  The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) Initial Capability Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.\n\nThe system collects, stores and delivers personnel\/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities.  The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nIn FY18, Personnel Recovery Mission Software (PRMS) modifications are required to develop and field PRMS 5.0 to enable the transition from the existing Web Forms implementation to a Model View Controller (MVC) implementation.  This release will also address known Deficiency Reports (DR), incorporate user inputs, facilitate reducing maintenance costs to operate PRMS, updating the User Interface (UI) to a modern design, and increase overall efficiency.  Additionally, Personnel Recovery Mission Manager (PRMM) modifications will import\/validate Isolated Personnel (IP) events\/alerts, import\/validate Isolated Personnel (IP) events\/alerts and enable case files for Defense Prisoner of War\/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) and Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA).\n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

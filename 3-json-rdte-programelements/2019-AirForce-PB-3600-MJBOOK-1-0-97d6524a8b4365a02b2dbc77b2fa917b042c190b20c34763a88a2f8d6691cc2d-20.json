Program efforts mitigate critical capability gaps identified in the March 2011 Air Force Next Generation Tactical Air (TACAIR) Capabilities Based Assessment and revalidated in 2016 by the AS2030 ECCT. This program will provide air superiority capability improvements in the areas of persistence, survivability, lethality, connectivity, interoperability, and affordability. Program activities will also include the pursuit of open architecture solutions including OMS and UCI standards management and preplanned product improvements. Funding provides program management support; operational concept exploration; technology studies, assessments and development; operational and system architecture development; maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, which includes weapons systems; and integrated system concept development and demonstration.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NGAD system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nBA-04 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Program efforts mitigate critical capability gaps identified in the March 2011 Air Force Next Generation Tactical Air (TACAIR) Capabilities Based Assessment and revalidated in 2016 by the AS2030 ECCT. This program will provide air superiority capability improvements in the areas of persistence, survivability, lethality, connectivity, interoperability, and affordability. Program activities will also include the pursuit of open architecture solutions including OMS and UCI standards management and preplanned product improvements. Funding provides program management support; operational concept exploration; technology studies, assessments and development; operational and system architecture development; maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, which includes weapons systems; and integrated system concept development and demonstration. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NGAD system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\n\nBA-04 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Furthermore, studies are required to develop operational\/system architectures to include family of systems and system of systems. In addition, technical risk reduction activities will be performed to include experimentation, integration and building demonstrative prototypes.\n\nFY17 Accomplishments:\nThe 2030+ AD working groups methodically assessed candidate concepts using USAF directives and guidance. Resulting concepts continue to inform the on-going Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), which remains on schedule. Furthermore, the AoA continues to integrate technologies into evolving threat environments and scenarios. Ongoing studies are conducted to refine system concepts and operational\/system architectures incorporating family of systems and system of systems that may be required to inform and support strategic choices. In addition, technical risk reduction studies concerning technology integration, operational and system trade space utilizing preliminary data from AD concept development have resulted in multiple activities and engagements to inform strategic USAF experimentation and prototyping efforts. Finally, technical overviews were presented to the Air Force - Scientific Advisory Board (AF-SAB) and other senior leaders."

Program efforts mitigate critical capability gaps identified in the March 2011 Air Force Next Generation Tactical Air (TACAIR) Capabilities Based Assessment and revalidated in 2016 by the AS2030 ECCT. This program will provide air superiority capability improvements in the areas of persistence, survivability, lethality, connectivity, interoperability, and affordability. Funding provides program management support; operational concept exploration; technology studies, assessments and development; operational and system architecture development; maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, which includes weapons systems; and integrated system concept development and demonstration. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NGAD system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F. \n\nBA-04 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

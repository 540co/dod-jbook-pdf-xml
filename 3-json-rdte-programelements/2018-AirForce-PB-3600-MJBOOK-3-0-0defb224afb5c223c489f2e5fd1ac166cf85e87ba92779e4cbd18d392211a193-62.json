The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. ARMS interfaces with the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and multiple operations and flight scheduling systems such as Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), Center Operations On-Line (COOL), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS) and is used to determine whom to select for flying operations, assignment actions, and promotion of aircrew members. \n\nNew development work is required to provide additional flying operations information which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following: electronic flight record, flying hour management\/execution, simulator and RPA management\/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and additional interfaces. \n\nDevelopment activities started in FY16 for Increment I (Inc I), Build 1, Flight and Flying Hour modules which continued in FY17 and is followed by development of Simulator Utilization Data and Training modules in FY18.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Technologies include data sciences including sensor processing algorithms, integration of sensor data, data processing and analytics, threat forecasting, and autonomous maneuver.  Techniques will be demonstrated to determine detection of IED threats and to identify trends to forecast probabilities of encountering or attributing IEDs based on operational data and machine learning techniques.  The goals for these technologies is to achieve high probabilities of detecting, predicting and attributing IEDs threats."

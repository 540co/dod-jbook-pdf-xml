This program is uniquely positioned to improve the US Industrial Base\u2019s ability to respond to the Departments needs by applying focused investments (as directed in 10 USC Sec 2508) to: 1) monitor and assess the current state of the IB, 2) address critical issues in the IB relating to Urgent Operational Needs, 3) address supply chain vulnerabilities and, 4) support efforts to expand the Industrial Base. \n\nManufacturing dominance underpins technical dominance. A healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base and resilient supply chains are essential to the economic strength and national security of the United States.  The ability of the United States to maintain readiness, and to surge in response to an emergency, directly relates to the capacity, capabilities, and resiliency of our manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains. \n\nIBAS is fundamental to achieving a modern IB that integrates traditional and emerging sectors to be able to respond at will to National Security Requirements. \n\nIBAS investments focus on addressing Industrial Base issues that support defense needs by identifying and closing gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and creating and sustaining reliable sources. Key areas of IBAS investment will include:\n1)\tadvancing and sustaining both traditional and emerging defense manufacturing sectors, \n2)\tpreserving critical and unique manufacturing and design skills, \n3)\tsupporting and expanding reliable sources, and \n4)\tidentifying and mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities"

MIBP collaborates with the services and agencies in performing assessments under the Title 10 USC Section 2505 program to identify elements of the industrial base critical to a healthy defense industrial base:\n\n1) Gaps in national-security-related domestic manufacturing capabilities\n2) Threatened, single, or sole source capabilities especially within the lower tiers\n3) Education and manufacturing workforce skills \n\nIBAS investments seek to ameliorate industrial base and manufacturing issues to strengthen the defense industrial base. All projects are evaluated for industrial base risk using fragility and criticality risk criteria, similar to the more familiar probability and consequence risk criteria.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific capability likely to be disrupted.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific capability difficult to replace if disrupted. \n\nIBAS currently focuses efforts and investments in four categories:  Radars, Sensors, and Electronics Sectors; Materials Sector; Munitions and Missiles Sector; and Cross-cutting Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Mitigation."

A new project will be initiated to preserve capability by manufacturing additional wafers targeting the performance requirements for space infrared sensors.\n\nHigh Performance Carbon Fiber: A number of specialized (high-strength and high modulus) carbon fibers are critical to manufacturing composite structures for all types of major U.S. space military and civilian programs  (e.g., satellites, space launch vehicles, spacecraft and a wide ride range of missile systems).  Key carbon fibers for these applications are unique, essential (not readily substitutable) and proprietary to a single producer\/single factory in one foreign country (Japan).  This foreign, single point-of-failure source of supply, of materials critical to essentially all major high priority space programs, is vulnerable to many severe and long-lasting supply disruption risks (e.g., natural disaster, industrial accidents, future Asia conflicts, foreign government controls and higher foreign commercial market priorities.  Regarding the latter, U.S. program carbon fiber use typically represents a small fraction of total global demand.  Carbon fibers recently developed in the U.S. and commercialized for civilian applications are promising alternatives to imports.  They represent a competitive second source, a more assured supply, cost less, and reportedly perform equal to or better than imports.  Historically, U.S. government programs have relied on single foreign sourced legacy materials and funding is often not available in government programs to test and qualify alternative second sources.  FY 2016 IBAS funds will be used to test and qualify U.S. second sources of commercially available carbon fibers.  With strong cooperation from industry primes, lower tier and material suppliers -- a significant list of promising U.S. government qualification program opportunities are identified for FY 2016 execution (e.g., multiple satellites, missiles and \u201cother\u201d systems).  Planned IBAS projects represent low technology risks, have well defined and near-term program transition points and are low-cost relative to significant industry investments in new, domestically manufactured carbon fiber supplies."

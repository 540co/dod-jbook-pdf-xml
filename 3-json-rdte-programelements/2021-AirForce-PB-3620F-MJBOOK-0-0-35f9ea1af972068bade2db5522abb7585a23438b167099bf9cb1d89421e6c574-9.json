ESS will meet the requirements for strategic communications and capability gaps identified in the Protected Satellite Communications Services (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the Protected Follow-on for Resiliency (PAFR) Study and the Strategic Tiger Team. The ESS architecture and functionality will be designed in accordance with the United States Strategic Command's signed ESS Concept of Operations and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's validated Capability Development Document (CDD) satisfying the legacy AEHF strategic requirements and mission performance with enhancements for increased resiliency and cybersecurity.\n            \n            ESS will support strategic mission requirements to provide the National Command Authority (NCA) and Combatant Commanders with highly-reliable, secure Military Satellite Communications. ESS will support the forecasted strategic demand in all operational environments and will be compatible with the existing architectures. The ESS system will satisfy emerging requirements using modular open system approaches to support incremental enhancements.\n            \n            For more rapid and resilient strategic capability risk reduction, the ESS Program Office is executing its approved Space Segment acquisition strategy that leverages Middle Tier Acquisition authorities from the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 for rapid prototyping, while maintaining the continuity of the AEHF strategic mission.  \n            \n            Activities for the ESS ground segment acquisition includes evolving and enhancing existing ground segment, space-to-ground segment integration, and modernization in support of Enterprise Ground Services compatibility, in accordance with the acquisition strategies and schedules. \n            \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ESS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \n            This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

This approach will award up to three contracts in FY 2020 to focus on reducing space segment risks with the objective of maximizing ESS demonstrated capability for the payload and other key technologies. An ESS Program Office-led RFP and source selection will determine which space prototyping contractor, via their performance during the rapid prototyping phase, is positioned for the space segment Build, I&T and Delivery follow-on.

Specifically, the funds will provide contractor support for the development of a pilot expanded database, procurement of additional directory lists, and the purchase of IT hardware and software for the development of a user- friendly interface for accessing the data. FY18 RDTE funds in HSPD-12 will be applied to the DoD NextGen USID and will allow the Department to replace the existing Teslin ID cards which are highly susceptible to counterfeiting due to an outdated design and lack of newer anti-counterfeiting technology, by completing the design of the new card form factor utilizing the latest technical and printing techniques on a plastic substrate which will undergo extensive quality."

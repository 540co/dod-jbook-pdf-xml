            "val": "The purpose of Airborne Reconnaissance System (ARS) Program is to develop, mature, demonstrate, and rapidly transition next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (active and passive systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities). It provides for modeling\/simulation, training and systems engineering. This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near real time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) efforts are set by the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Capabilities Working Group (GCWG), for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities within the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and ASI efforts. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. ASARS 2B efforts include, but are not limited to, development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \nThis activity also funds Sensors Open Systems Architecture (SOSA), which coordinates the development of advanced technologies open architecture development for sensor modalities such as RADAR, SIGINT, EW, communications and EO\/IR in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned.  Funding in this activity also supports Detection Removal and Characterization Operation (DRACO) and Agile ISR, to develop a robust image quality improvement capability for airborne synthetic aperture radar products supporting multiple platforms at high, medium, and low altitudes. Additionally, funding covers GCWG Secretariat to manage GCWG planning, processes, and establish an Air Force GEOINT architecture. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Airborne Reconnaissance Systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.\n\nThe funds in this project are distributed in priority order, as supported by the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and set by the GCWG, for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the ASI AoA as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. ASARS-2B efforts include but are not limited to development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test, and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.\n\nInclusive in I&TS is the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface Systems Automated Target Recognition (ATR) effort to further mature a robust capability to detect all classes of targets through camouflage. \n\nThe purpose of DRACO is to create a robust Image Quality improvement capability for Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) products.  All other details are classified.  The software resided in multiple locations on the ground supporting the Air Force, Army, Navy and other customers DRACO efforts include but are not limited to development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test and transition of image quality improvement capabilities and airborne SAR Sensors. \n\nThe Sensor Open System Architecture (SOSA) program coordinates the development of advanced technologies open architecture development for the following modalities of sensors, such as RADAR, SIGINT, EW, Communications and EO\/IR (development of standards and open architecture interfaces for Software, Hardware, and Electrical\/Mechanical interfaces in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned.  Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly upgrade\/iterate advanced interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for remotely piloted aircraft through development of abstraction interfaces for sense (RADAR, ADS-B, TCAS, etc\u2026.) and avoid logic. The program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near real time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.  The SOSA program also increases interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces, as well as leveraging industry participation towards creating COTS solutions such as common C4ISR processor, AgilePOD interfaces, Red\/Black separation on the sensor, data at rest, and security\/anti-tamper (AT) with industry partners and other DOD services\n\n\nThe project is designed to support development of next generation of sensors driven by Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) Analysis of alternatives (AoA), as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document( Next Generation Sensors), as well as AFLCMC\/WI\/WN\/WW program of record needs.  As part of the development effort SOSA will be funding and supporting first article development of key open architecture solutions to validate\/verify open specifications as well as to prime the COTS vendors development strategies.  SOSA will also stand up AFLCMC SIL for Sensors Open System Architectures to establish a strong conformance\/compliance program with industry partners for COTS products in partnership with other DOD Services. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F."

                            "val": "The Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) is the DoD simulation\/training system of choice for many Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), RPA, and ISR systems. MUSE is also know as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force Application. The MUSE\/AFSERS is a software suite that simulates ISE & strike systems, tailored air vehicle & data links, and visualization systems used for payload product outputs-including Full Motion Video (FMV), Still Frame Imagery, or GMTO data. Air vehicles, sensors, datalinks, takeoff and landing systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS and RPA ground stations, when actual ground stations are unavailable. FMV, still frame imagery, or GMTI data are provided. Outputs are compliant with applicable DoD standards and are continually tested against actual ground ISR processors to ensure interoperability with over 40 systems within DoD.  \n\nThe Services and combatant commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE\/AFSERS creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures refinement, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the combatant commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.\n\nThe MUSE\/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.\n\nMUSE\/AFSERS is currently in use within all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M\/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the AFSERS provides imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of critical imagery processes. The MUSE\/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.\n\nThe Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is the center of excellence that supports the UAS and RPA programs within the services by providing the system engineering, test and integration, interoperability, rapid technology insertion and training to address MUSE\/AFSERS requirements. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC\/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. The JTC\/SIL contributes to the distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, and are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Airborne Reconnaissance Systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F."

The Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) approved Air Combat Command's recommendation to transition Gorgon Stare from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to an Air Force Enduring Capability in November 2014.  Gorgon Stare's requirements are documented in the Gorgon Stare Wide Area Airborne Sensor Capabilities Development Document (draft).  The acquisition strategy for this Air Force podded sensor suite solution is sustainment of the currently fielded capabilities with any upgrades implemented via validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.\n\nDevelopment efforts conducted with FY 2015 Congressionally added funds included efforts focused primarily on the development of a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability in support of an Urgent Operational Need.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2016 Congressionally added RDT&E funds included further development and system integration lab testing of Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Gorgon Stare Increment 2 Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors.  Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for future airborne integration efforts as required.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2017 Congressionally added funds further progressed efforts associated with BLOS, to include first article testing for phase 1 and a limited BLOS capability expected to deliver to the field in FY 2019. Development efforts conducted with FY 2018 Congressionally added funds include but are not limited to efforts to further develop the design and implementation of the next BLOS phase to enable freedom of maneuverability and initial development of system imagery improvements in support of a MAJCOM validated -1067.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2019 Congressional added funds include but are not limited to; completing BLOS Phase II system design and aircraft certification to enable full freedom of maneuverability; completing imagery improvements in support of a MAJCOM validated -1067 and continuation of data automation through Area of Interest (AOI) tagging and tracking efforts.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Gorgon Stare capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F and 0605833F."

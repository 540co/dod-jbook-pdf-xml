            "val": "This program provides for the development, integration, demonstration and detailed assessment of capabilities which improve deployment, distribution and supply chain decision-making\/collaboration (e.g., planning stage to real-time execution\/retrograde operations) without need for highly specialized operators. Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations\/analytics, distribution demand forecasting\/execution monitoring, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion to include drilldown capability, and resilient Command & Control (C2) infrastructure capabilities. Current planning, forecasting, and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems to include the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need. Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces. The ability to rapidly determine the impact of any delays\/changes and conduct \"what-if\" impact assessments on the closure of force packages is required. This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations\/analytics, distribution demand forecasting\/execution monitoring, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion to include drilldown capability, and resilient Command & Control (C2) infrastructure capabilities. Current planning, forecasting, and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems to include the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need. Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces. The ability to rapidly determine the impact of any delays\/changes and conduct \"what-if\" impact assessments on the closure of force packages is required. This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations."

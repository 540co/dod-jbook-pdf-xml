Section 2521.\n\nThe DMS&T program supports the National Defense Strategy (2018) which states a healthy defense industrial base is a critical element of U.S. power and the National Security Innovation Base.  The ability of the military to surge in response to an emergency depends on our Nation\u2019s ability to produce needed parts and systems, healthy and secure supply chains, and a skilled U.S. workforce.  The objective of the DMS&T program is to increase the speed of innovation and provide frequent technology off-ramp opportunities, turning inventions and scientific discoveries into actual equipment and capabilities for our men and women in uniform as quickly and affordably as possible.  The DMS&T program has created and is sustaining an ecosystem that addresses near term critical technology requirements and accelerates promising technology (hypersonics, directed energy, artificial intelligence, etc.) to the warfighter via innovative manufacturing methods through a two-pronged strategy: (1) OSD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) R&D projects and the (2) Manufacturing Innovation Institutes (MIIs).\n\nThis program also supports many of the recommendations in the Executive Order Report \u201cAssessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States\u201d September 2018.\n\nThere are two project codes in this Program Element (PE) : P680 OSD Manufacturing Technology and P350 the DoD Manufacturing USA Institutes.  \n\nP680 OSD Manufacturing Technology:\nThe OSD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) program was established to address needs beyond the risk of a single Service or agency. It focuses on cross-cutting defense manufacturing needs and stimulates early development of manufacturing processes and enterprise business practices, concurrent with S&T development, to achieve the largest cost-effective impact and facilitate development of enabling capabilities for the warfighters.\n\nP350 DoD Manufacturing USA Innovation Institutes: \nThis project is focused on supporting eight DoD led manufacturing innovation institutes which are part of the Manufacturing USA network of manufacturing innovation institutes.  The technologies that are being pursued include (1) additive manufacturing; (2) digital manufacturing, design and manufacturing cybersecurity; (3) lightweight metals; (4) integrated photonics; (5) flexible hybrid microcircuits; (6) smart fibers and textiles; (7) advanced tissue biofabrication and; (8) advanced robots for manufacturing.  Each institute is a public\/private partnership that matches DoD funding at a one to one ratio or greater and has established a consortium of members from industry and academia to mature the manufacturing processes in their respective areas, to build out the ecosystems that supports these areas, and provides resources supporting advanced manufacturing education and workforce development.  Through the government investment, DoD maintains strategic influence in the work accomplished by the institutes and realizes accelerated technological innovation for defense products."

The executing military department or agency, in close coordination with OSD, uses a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selects a winning consortium. The final terms of the cooperative agreement\/technology investment agreement between the selectee and the federal government are then negotiated and the CA or TIA is signed. Throughout and after completion of this process, the federal government makes clear that members of non-selected teams are encouraged to join the selected consortium as conditions permit."

Notwithstanding this complexity, the Department is careful to maintain orientation with the DoD ManTech program\u2019s statutory goals and objectives and has concluded that those requirements are highly complementary to, and supportive of, the broader national goals of the Manufacturing USA Program as laid out in the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act of 2014. Performance relative to both sets of goals\/objectives is necessarily measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and many of the institutes accomplishments previously addressed represent rich and highly descriptive qualitative and quantitative measure of program performance. The Department actively reviews or oversees the review of institute metrics at four levels: 1) the overall Manufacturing USA network level (this is done in coordination with the DoD\u2019s Manufacturing USA interagency partners), 2) at the DoD\/funding agency level (per the statutory requirements of DoD ManTech Program), 3) at the individual institute level (in coordination with each institute), and 4) at the specific technology project level (via DoD technical expert involvement in the institutes). Broadly, the institutes themselves are charged by the DoD, the Administration and Congress with ensuring that key elements of their innovation ecosystems will be matured and made widely available by fostering collaborations between appropriate elements of that ecosystem. \n\nThe following four categories of metrics have emerged as common focus areas:\n1.  Impact on U.S. Innovation Ecosystem\n2.  Financial Leverage\/Sustainability\n3.  Education and Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development\n4.  Technical Advancement\nSpecific metrics and the annual cycle for measuring progress against benchmarks are developed for each institute consortium and reflect that institute\u2019s unique technology capability, expertise, and organizational structure. The Department strives to ensure that the assessment process captures and articulates the benefits to national security based upon technological advancements and the industrial base."

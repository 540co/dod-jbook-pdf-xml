Our approach is composed of three innovative building blocks:  1)  Machine learning techniques applied to commercial GEOINT for automated anomaly and change detection throughout the country of interest - crucial element for enhancing  our indications and warnings required for precision strikes; 2)  Machine-Human collaboration architecture to accelerate the F3EA joint forces targeting and decision-making cycle; and 3)  Autonomous weaponeering demonstration - Exercise secure (C2S) cloud for timely precision strikes to hold mobile missile systems at risk.  These blocks will serve to overcome the sparse data problem set and reduce the decision-making process."

            "val": "DV6 - General Fund Enterprise Business System-Sensitive Activities (GFEBS-SA): GFEBS-SA is a designated National Security System (NSS) and is leveraging the GFEBS base system that is a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning System certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council. The GFEBS base system has reached Full Deployment and is currently in sustainment. The Army still has classified and sensitive financial activity remaining in legacy systems that cannot be processed in the fully-fielded GFEBS system; therefore, GFEBS-SA is an essential financial program designed to enable the auditability that is needed to comply with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), and prevent compromise of data that could cause grave harm to U.S. forces. To protect sensitive information and enable clean auditability, the Army requires a separate instance of GFEBS operated on a secure network for processing sensitive and classified financial transactions. GFEBS-SA will integrate with GFEBS to provide secure, web-based financial execution and reporting capabilities for the Army's classified and sensitive activities. GFEBS-SA is envisioned as a fully functional GFEBS application operated on a secure network (SIPRNET), leveraging off of the sustained system design and implementation that includes additional performance requirements designed to protect sensitive intelligence operations and special operations missions. It will process Secret Collateral and below information while providing GFEBS capabilities such as distribution and execution of appropriated funds, cost management, financial reporting, and asset management. GFEBS-SA will be implemented and deployed to 3,000 users across 100 locations worldwide. GFEBS-SA will support information exchanges with organizations that support the Army's sensitive activities mission, including cross-security domain integration between SIPRNet and NIPRNet with GFEBS and other system partners. Services will be capable of being upgraded throughout the life of the program in order to incorporate advances in best business practices and technology. The funding requested in FY19 supports continued system development in order to allow communication to other systems supporting the auditability of classified financial data, system hosting in the DISA environment, testing, and pre-deployment activities. Overall, the RDT&E funding in FY19 supports the transition from development to deployment of the GFEBS-SA effort.   \n\nEV4 - General Fund Enterprise Business System Increment II (GFEBS Inc II):  GFEBS Increment II is in support of the Army's Standard Labor Time Tracking (SLTT) Problem Statement approved by the Office of the Secretary Defense (OSD). The program plans to use an enterprise approach for development and deployment consisting of GFEBS, Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), Global Combat Support System Army (GCSS-A), and Logistics Modernization Program (LMP). SLTT is designed to expand on the time and attendance from supporting payroll processing to enable labor tracking for cost of products\/services. Currently, the program is repositioning due to funding being reprogrammed to fund higher priority efforts. Two of the original three GFEBS Increment II requirements [Integrated Resource Management (IRM) & Enhanced Financial Integration (EFI)] have been merged into the GFEBS baseline based on a new acquisition approach in accordance with the DoD 5000.75); until a program office is designated as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), GFEBS will request funding for the remaining requirement (Standard Labor Time Tracking [SLTT]) through the Program Objective Memorandum (POM).\n\nGF5 - General Fund Business Enterprise System (GFEBS): GFEBS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program currently in the sustainment phase. It follows the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act, The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS subsumed the capabilities, in full or in part, of financial systems operating in excess of 40 years including the Standard Finance System and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS is used to administer the Army's General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions with virtually real time information. On 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed Wave 1 to end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, and several other organizations. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011, and Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012. Current efforts include sustaining the system and infrastructure, making modifications needed for audit readiness, compliancy, and upgrades required to maintain the system and meet SAP standards. Additionally, GFEBS continues to make changes as requested by the user community through the Process Owners Group; an SES and General Officers level board that prioritizes user needs.  Some of these changes require RDT&E funding."

However, based on a detailed analysis of the original System Integrator, an Army determination was made that they could not deliver a solution to meet the GFEBS-SA requirement. The program was restructured with an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 9 September 2016 in alignment with an Army-validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS). A new System Integrator contract began work on 1 May 2017 with a schedule that supports the Army's timeline; minimizing operational risks to the Army's sensitive activity commands."

The program plans to use an enterprise approach for development and deployment consisting of GFEBS, Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), Global Combat Support System Army (GCSS-A), and Logistics Modernization Program (LMP). SLTT is designed to expand on the time and attendance from supporting payroll processing to enable labor tracking for cost of products\/services. Labor costs account for over 60% of the Army budget and currently there is no standard process or materiel solution to enable the capture and analytical review of the information. This effort will eliminate redundant labor tracking systems, increase efficiencies, ensure the workforce is the right size and mix, and will be financially auditable. These labor hours will be accurate and the costs associated with this labor will be mapped in a timely manner (especially since some Army organizations are fully reimbursable). By doing this, the Army can terminate other time tracking systems or processes currently being used. Furthermore, it will support the audibility of reimbursable intra-Army work."

It follows the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act, The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS subsumed the capabilities, in full or in part, of financial systems operating in excess of 40 years, including the Standard Finance System and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS is used to administer the Army's General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions with virtually real time information. On 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed Wave 1 to end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, and several other organizations. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011, and Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012. Current efforts include sustaining the system and infrastructure, making modifications needed for audit readiness, compliancy, and upgrades required to maintain the system and meet SAP standards. Additionally, GFEBS continues to make changes as requested by the user community through the Process Owners Group; an SES and General Officers level board that prioritizes user needs.  Some of these changes require developmental funding."

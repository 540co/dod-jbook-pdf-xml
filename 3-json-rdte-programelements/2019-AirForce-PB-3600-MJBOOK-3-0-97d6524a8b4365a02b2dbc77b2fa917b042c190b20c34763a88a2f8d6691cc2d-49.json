Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment, sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during air\/land operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.\n\nC-17 RDT&E funding efforts support, but are not limited to:  Aircraft performance improvements and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications\/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering\/program management administration support; support for avionics laboratories; software development, test and integration; block development\/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering\/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-17 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nIn FY19 the efforts are:  Roll-On Conference Capsule (ROCC), Fire Filter Mitigation, Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS), Real Time In Cockpit (RTIC), and Fixed Installation Satellite Antenna (FISA), which will be covered in more detail on subsequent pages.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier\/Squad Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602786A (Warfighter Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA."

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers, which are rapidly deployable\/re-locatable, require no Military Construction, and need limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations, and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and assesses the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under Program Element (PE) 0602786A\/Project VT4. Demonstrated EBC equipment is transitioned to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier\/Squad Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is led, performed, and\/or managed by the Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA."

The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) ONR Experimentation (OE) develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations; (3) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet\/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions; and (5) support for the Naval Precision Strike Operations, providing the Navy capability to quickly locate, target, and strike critical targets.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The performance of the work funded in this PE is reviewed at several levels to ensure that the investment is relevant and productive.  At the macroscopic level, the investment is coordinated with Navy Warfare Development Command and Commander, Fleet Forces Command to address the goals and objectives identified for sea trials and Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs).  At the microscopic level, the work funded in this PE is reviewed periodically by the Program Manager to ensure the investment is meeting the goals defined for each project. This review includes feedback collected from the warfighter community on all sea trials and LOEs to support the Program Manager's assessment of the value and relevance of each investment. Furthermore, the entire program is reviewed yearly by the Chief of Naval Research."

A ground up system re-architecture is underway with an initial operating capability scheduled for 4th quarter 2019. The system redesign will provide the next generation platform that can pace and align with the expanding mission. The re-architecture will deliver a new platform that fosters communication\/information sharing, adaptability, and an enhanced cyber posture while reducing annual investments in software licensing and technical support."

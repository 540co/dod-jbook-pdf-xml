Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state, and local environmental\/health laws and to reduce the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, technologies to empower rapid fielding of next generation energetics, propellants and munitions with focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond, and enable decision making based on accurate environmental conditions in sparse data environments. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution, and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations. Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling, and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions, and develops environmental sensor capabilities to enable rapid collection and analysis of data for real-time environmental situational awareness. \n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nTechnologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The resultant technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment."

This Project will also provide integrated knowledge of environmental factors in mission planning activities creating a unified, comprehensive and integrated battlefield landscape of future threats, opportunities and impacts to mission success in sparse data environments enabling mission planners to identify the industrial\/commercial resources used as components of weapons development. These resultant technologies streamline the acquisition process, enabling rapid fielding of new materials, increase Army readiness through proactive hazard management strategies for military materials, enhance the Army's ability to improve decision-making based on accurate environmental conditions in sparse data environments, and reduce Army liabilities associated with unforeseen environmental impacts.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This Project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The Project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality\/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid\/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment."

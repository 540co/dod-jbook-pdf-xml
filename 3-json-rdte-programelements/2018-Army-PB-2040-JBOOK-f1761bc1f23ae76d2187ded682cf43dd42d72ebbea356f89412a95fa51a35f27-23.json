Phase I solicits potential solutions from existing Army programs, tech base programs, and industry to deliver capabilities that achieve the Army's Network 2020 Endstates and Objectives and Forces 2025 beyond.  It establishes initial objectives, solidifies the architecture baseline and will establish a viable candidate list for Network Integration Evaluation (NIE).  During Phase II, the project supports the compilations of potential solutions that could meet the Army's Mission Command gaps and the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) identified gaps which supports the development of integration and testing concepts for the NIE.  Phase III includes the coordinated efforts between System of Systems Integration (SOSE&I), Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) at Ft Bliss and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to finalize the brigade architecture \"horseblanket\", integration and test planning, training requirements and combat mission evaluations.  Phase III also includes the initial integration phase where Systems Under Test (SUT) and government\/industry System Under Evaluation (SUE) hardware and software are integrated and initially evaluated for follow-on consideration at Aberdeen Proving Ground's (APG) Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) labs through the Lab Based Risk Reduction (LBRR) process.  This project provides for Network Integration of all SUTs and SUEs (industry and\/or government) Hardware\/Software into existing CERDEC System Integration Laboratories at APG to risk reduce evaluation architectures, network configurations and identify integration issues prior to NIE.  This effort continues into Phase IV as the network matures and becomes functional in the Lab.  The results of this detailed lab based testing\/evaluations will determine which SUTs and industry\/government SUEs will continue in the NIE (Phases IV\/V of the Army's Agile Network Integration process) and establishes the initial Network configuration that will be used in NIE.  LBRR also reduces risk to NIE execution by testing the Network in the lab, resolving issues found in the Network lab test and optimizing the Networks performance.  This is done in a lab environment that facilitates very efficient, cost effective determination of problems, and their subsequent corrections.  \n\nAdditionally this project will integrate the Network at the CERDEC labs facilitate participation by small businesses and interfaces and integrate with Government Programs of Record with unique military secure interfaces and protocols.  Purchase of any additional hardware and support above and beyond the proposed or available support if required for Lab Based Risk Reduction is also funded within this project.  For Government SUEs, this project funds integration support at the CERDEC Labs.  If the NIE program requires additional prototypes above and beyond the Program of Record for the Lab based Risk Reduction, it will also purchase this equipment. This project also funds keeping the Network baseline up to date so that integration is always into the current baseline network."

Technologies will be demonstrated in relevant environments, performing tactical\/operational scenarios. Efforts will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability within one to five years. Efforts will include accelerated material development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs in Cyber; Electronic Warfare (EW); Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Survivability and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical Program of Record capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements, and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.\nThe Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders\u2019 needs. The Army RCO was established per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT: Establishment of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, signed by the Secretary of the Army: Eric K. Fanning, dated 11 August 2016.\nThe RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and\/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally. Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.   \n\nThe RCO capabilities focus areas are:\nCyber\nElectronic Warfare (EW)\nPosition, Navigation and Timing (PNT)\nSurvivability\nOperational Needs Statements (ONS)\nAny other operational needs that become a priority as designated by the Army Board of Directors (BOD)"

This is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) adapting COTS\/GOTS\/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and 2) developing emerging deployable capability through research and development organizations, academia, and industry. The RCO uses streamlined acquisition methods, processes and techniques to rapidly acquire capability; these methods vary by project. The Rapid Capabilities Office will have a dedicated contracting staff, with the flexibility to use both traditional and non-traditional contracting approaches. To reach non-traditional vendors, RCO will use non-standard contracting methods, such as Other Transaction Authority instruments. Where practicable, prototypes will be acquired using competitive procedures. Projects will be transitioned to an approved acquisition program for production and sustainment. Operational assessments will be conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation, prototype maturation, and future capability development."

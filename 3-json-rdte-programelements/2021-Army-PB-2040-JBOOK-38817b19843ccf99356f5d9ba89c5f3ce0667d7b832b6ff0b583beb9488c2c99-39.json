The overall FWC decrease is a function of balancing between the FWC and APNT CFT funding for FY2020.  Once Project FE5 funding transfers to Project 990 in FY2021 (see separate 990 R-Form), FWC is expected to realize an increase of $2.789M for the APNT bridging effort plus fact-of-life inflationary adjustments."

In addition, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3910 (FFT Operations Guidance) directs USSTRATCOM's ASCC to execute eight specified FFT mission support responsibilities that include providing a testing and development capability to support joint, interagency and coalition partners FFT operations. USASMDC\/ARSTRAT: Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for space, the Army integrator for global missile defense (GMD), and the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) of the USSTRATCOM. Army Regulation (AR) 10-87, Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007, and AR 5-22, The Army Force Modernization Proponent System, dated 19 August 2009, designated USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Space\/High Altitude capabilities. As the Army proponent for space and high altitude, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions.\n\nProject FE5 funds USASMDC\/ARSTRAT efforts to develop, analyze and mature warfighting concepts, and conduct warfighting experiments for space and high altitude capabilities. USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is the proponent for space\/high altitude capabilities and is responsible for determining and integrating DOTMLPF-P for the Army.\nThe program also funds development and integration of new data sources and services into the JFFT Mission Management Center (MMC), providing users FFT information system services at the highest Mission Assurance Category level (MAC 1). Software products developed and deployed by the JFFT Testbed into the MMC enable the receipt, integration and dissemination of real-time FFT information to the Common Operating Picture (COP) displays for Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Forces and coalition partners. JFFT Subject Matter Expert support to critical FFT interoperability assessments and development activities with coalition partners are supporting DOD's priority of strong alliances and partnerships. Integrated FFT data solutions developed by JFFT Testbed enable FFT data for COP display and Situational Awareness between Army forces and Unified Action Partners. The JFFT Testbed will continues to leverage FFT systems expertise and reduce Department of Defense costs by supporting numerous efforts, including the joint Personnel Recovery community response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement to resolve critical issues in isolated persons reporting and locating."

Result: This FDU is the result of the application of the full Manpower Requirements Criteria (MARC) to the FBM Battery TOE and is based upon the first transfer of power generation maintenance tasks that have been performed by contractors (CME) to military personnel and the partial application of MARC being performed by the 249th EN BN.  Changes to the FBM Battery are primarily driven by the application of the full Manpower Requirements Criteria (MARC) to the workload placed upon the Power Generation Section which drives a requirement of 20 soldiers per FBM Battery (20 x 5=100). Impact: Power generation at the five FBM Batteries is critical to the operation of the AN\/TPY-2 radars and the life support areas at each location. USASMDC is completing efforts to convert critical power generation for its five remote FBM Radar sites from contractor to military performance.  This conversion is in line with a previous VCSA decision on 24 Jan 2013 to implement the conversion.  This conversation eliminates extreme high risk associated with contracted power generation support to the five FBM Radar Batteries and standardizes levels of support for all FBM sites are ready to address the challenges of an MDO.\n- Provided Force Development counsel to SMD CoE leadership in order to engagement and influence the CCoE?s review of the 53rd?s requirements , providing command advocacy for satellite control capabilities for the 53rd Signal BN and to submit an FDU tied to LSCO gap #15. Provided inputs into the 53rd Signal BN FDU and the standup of the SMDC SATOPS BDE.  The SATSOPs BDE centralized SATCOM operations and management under a single command organization. RESULT: Injected requirements for growth of 53rd Signal BN capabilities in intelligence, logistics and satellite monitoring and mission command into Signal End to End (SE2E) briefings for senior Army leaders.  Provided instructional force development guidance on the organizational concept for SMDC SATOPS BDE for a command plan submission. IMPACT: 53rd Signal BN equities were briefed to CSA resulting in initiation of a force design update (FDU) by the Cyber Center of Excellence to mitigate documented capability shortfalls in mission command and monitoring of the global military wideband satellite constellation associated with LSCO Gap 15, EAB Network Operations and the Army now has a SATOPs BDE that can integrate SATCOM, SATCON and SATOPs for the Army.\n\nDeveloped the analysis, Courses of Action (COAs) and recommendations to SMD CoE leaders and ASL on the future of Army Space Forces to support a Multi-Domain Force (MDO).  RESULT:  My team?s analysis will provided Army leaders with multiple COAs to consider the best way forward to distribute space control (SC) force structure and capabilities across the Army prior to the establishment of Army MDO force package #1. IMPACT:  The COAs will provide ASL multiple options to ?buy? Space forces.  The COAs provide no force structure options and options with force structure bills to ensure leaders can weigh the risk to operational impact of investing in Space capabilities.  Properly aligned SRC40 structure across the force will help the Army address LSCO gaps and set the way forward for in a MDO.  \n\n- Developed the 1st Space Brigade Force Design Update (FDU) Jr. for submission and approval by Army Futures Command and HQDA.  RESULT:  This FDU Jr. redesigned the 1st Space BDE by redistributing the SSAPTs\/TSSAPTs from the BDE HQ and reinvesting them in the 1st Space BN to create Space Control Planning Teams (SCPT).  Additionally it realigned force structure in the 1st Space BN to create Space Control Companies (SCC). These new force designs were derived from Space BDE lessons learned on the use of ARSST in today?s operating force and lesson learned from the ICEWS Space Company exercises.  IMPACT: The 1st Space BDE lacked capacity in space control to meet the demands identified in LSCO and MDO.  The realignment of personnel from the SSAPTs\/TSSAPTs and SCCs will ensure the Army can address LSCO gaps, Space formation can survive in a MDO operating environment, and attack a threat force?s Space avenue of approach.  SCPTs and SCCs will disrupt\/negate threat Space based capabilities.  SCPTs and SCCs will ensure threat commanders will be desynced and disaggregated in their MDO.  This FDU significantly increases the Army?s Space Control capability while simultaneously presenting no force structure bill to the Army."

ONR sponsors scientific advances, which lead to Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs), supporting the Fleet's ability to operate from a position of technological superiority. Functions performed include (1) scientific and technical direction of the nationwide 6.1 basic research program with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and Naval Laboratories and Warfare Centers; (2) scientific and technical direction of the 6.2 applied research program through the Naval R&D laboratories and Warfare Centers and industry; (3) scientific and technical direction of the Naval 6.3 advanced technology development program through the Navy's R&D laboratories, Warfare Centers and industry; (4) management, resource formulation, program assessment, and contract negotiation\/administration of the Navy basic research, applied research and advanced technology development program; and (5) coordination of the Navy's Technology Base program within the context of total DoD\/Government (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences) R&D initiatives in order to maximize scientific advances. This project also supports ONR Non-MHA management and direction for the following Navy-wide programs:  Small Business Innovation Research, Naval Research Advisory Committee, Navy Patent Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities\/Minority Institutions Program, Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear (SSBN) Security Technology Program. \n\nAdditionally, this project funds ONR field salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  Functions performed support ONR's Navy-wide responsibilities in the negotiation and establishment of indirect cost rates for DoD-assigned universities and performance of contract administration for all DoD contracts\/grants at all colleges and universities."

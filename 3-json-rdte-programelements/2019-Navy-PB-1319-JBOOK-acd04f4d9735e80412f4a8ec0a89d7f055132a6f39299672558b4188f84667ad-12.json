            "val": "Mission Description:  The Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure ionizing radiation.  These instruments are used on all Navy, Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels, and at every Navy shore installation, in order to ensure the safety of personnel, continuity of operations in radiological contingencies, and protection of the environment.\n\nJustification:  Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 (10 CFR 20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or are exposed to radioactive materials in their jobs.  Additionally, the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) reasons under the provisions of 10 CFR 20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, and Radiological Affairs Support.  Non-OSH programs include Radiological Defense, Consequence Management, Training, Technical (RADIAC calibration, shielding evaluation, research, etc.) and Radiological Search (maritime interdiction and radiological search missions to locate or intercept WMD).\n\nThis budget item develops, tests and evaluates new, highly reliable, more easily calibrated, easy to care and maintain, light weight and modern RADIAC instruments in order to improve the effectiveness of radiation safety, to make instruments simpler to use, and to reduce life cycle costs.  The ultimate goal is to replace old, bulky, costly to maintain and repair, unreliable and obsolete instrumentation with multifunction equipment that can be automatically calibrated at greatly reduced cost.\n\nThis budget item also provides for improvement to nuclear weapons intrinsic radiation (gamma and neutron) shielding calculations, mixed field (neutron and gamma) dosimetry, and in neutron measurement.  The objective is to develop less costly and more effective integral shielding for better personnel protection and safety.  Improvement in personnel dosimetry and neutron measurement is also a major emphasis."

RADIACs are also required after an act of terrorism or war that involves nuclear material in order to enable continuing warfighting ability.\n\nJustification: Many RADIAC instruments and dosimetry systems are decades old and approaching the end of their useful lives.  In some cases the equipment and replacement parts are no longer manufactured, making the equipment logistically unsupportable.  In other cases increasing failure rates due to age make replacements an economic efficiency\nimprovement.  In all cases a technology refresh will make both economic sense in terms of lowering the total ownership costs, and will also provide increased operational capabilities.\n  \nNaval Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP):  Instruments are developed to support the safe operation and maintenance of nuclear powered vessels and at nuclear maintenance facilities.\n\nNon-NNPP: Instruments are developed to support other than NNPP end users, such as Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, Industrial Radiography, Radiological Defense and Training.\n \nVisit, Board, Search & Seizure (VBSS): The Navy has been tasked to intercept and board vessels at sea to search for nuclear or radiological materials that could be used for terrorist attacks. These instruments would have different characteristics than those used for NNPP and non-NNPP purposes and prototypes must be developed and\/or tested and evaluated."

The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBND) is currently developing the RDS for use by all the Services.  When all the Services agree on a single system, it will lower the procurement cost for all and just as significantly, for the first time enable Joint interoperability in the warfighter's Radiological Defense arena.  The Navy's current version of this instrument is the IM-260\/PD, which is 30 years old and nearing the end of its useful life.  Army and Marine Corps use the AN\/PDR-75 system and the Air Force the ADM-300, which are both also decades old and obsolescent.\n\nThe NNPP end use is unique amongst the Services, and while the RDS solution should prove to be sufficient for all the Services for most of their respective applications, Navy must test and evaluate the proposed RDS to ensure the performance and specifications of a Joint solution will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the NNPP application."

Such a sensitive mission requires leading edge technology and capabilities to ensure success.  The AN\/PDX-1 RADIAC Set was fielded in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement to meet this requirement.  It contains three instruments that serve different purposes:  (1) a Handheld Radiation Monitor (HRM)that searches for radiological materials; (2) a Radioisotope Identifier (RID) that identifies the type of radiological material located; and (3) a Personal Radiation Detector (PRD) that displays the radiological dose the VBSS team members may be receiving so that they can be aware if they are being exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity during the mission.  Current technology dictates that the sensitivity of the detectors is directly proportional to the size of the detector element; i.e., the larger the detector, the more sensitive and capable it is.  However, in VBSS there must be a tradeoff between size\/weight and capability, since it is difficult and hazardous for boarding parties to carry a backpack-sized detector, along with their weapons and other gear, up a rope ladder to board a vessel on the high seas.  This will be a continuing effort to find smaller, lighter instruments with enhanced sensitivity, reach-back capability, and other enhancements to provide the Navy the best and most cost effective equipment possible for this critical mission."

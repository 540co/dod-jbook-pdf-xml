This project supports optimized integration of Directed Energy (DE) and other high powered mission systems, appropriate component and system controls, integration of components and systems into future and current ships, and providing power and energy system solution alternatives to new and existing platforms. Existing ships' power systems require optimized integration via energy storage and advanced controls techniques to withstand the effects of DE and other high powered mission systems and avoid negative impacts to power generating equipment (diesel\/gas turbine engines and generators).  \n\nProject developments are aligned with the Navy's 30 year shipbuilding plan via the Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap (TDR), which outlines the way ahead for future developments and provides a basis for coordinated planning and investment by the Navy and private industry. \n\nThis project develops and transitions products that electrically integrate and provide power to mission systems, integrates those components and systems into ship platforms, increases energy efficiency, and provides cybersecurity capabilities for current in-service Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) systems as well as future systems. \n\nThe systems developed by this Project are by their very nature the foundation of the ships kill chain, and are developed with efficiency requirements as part of total life cycle cost minimization.  Efforts within Power and Energy Systems are to design, develop, test and integrate shipboard power systems to incorporate advanced sensors, directed energy and other advanced weapons. Design and testing includes modeling and simulation, as well as land based testing, to reduce risk and demonstrate readiness for shipboard use.   \n\nCybersecurity: Develops an approach to implement a cybersecurity Boundary Defense Capability (BDC) for HM&E control systems on surface ships. The HM&E systems to be protected from cyber-attack by BDC include machinery control systems, electric power systems, damage control and firefighting, auxiliary machinery and fluid systems, engines and power transmission systems, gas turbine systems, video systems, as well as other HM&E systems. Design and technical data packages for software and hardware solutions will be developed.  Cybersecurity BDC will allow the ship to better protect, detect, respond, and recover from cyber-attack."

Prior to FY19, this PE has designed, built, and tested the Energy Storage Module (ESM) prototype.  Lessons learned from ESM prototype development are being incorporated into the Energy Magazine (EM), an energy storage system with advanced controls, to serve as the energy resource to enable the introduction of pulsed high power and energy weapons and sensor systems.  When fully integrated, EM is expected to also reduce the number of Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) on ships which decreases maintenance and costs.\n\nThe EM energy storage system includes power electronics, controls, power conversion components, and energy storage media.  Pulsed high power and energy weapons and sensors require different levels of power and energy storage devices with system specific dynamic interfaces (how quickly power\/energy is required).  As part of EM development, this PE is pursuing a variety of energy storage media and a common interface to these various storage media for ease of inter-operability in the future.  Examples of energy storage media include batteries (i.e., lithium iron phosphate), capacitors, ultra-capacitors, and flywheels.\n\nDevelop and deliver executable models and an EM Model Description Document (MDD) that capture the behavior of the system, conduct control system analysis, generate detailed interface requirements, and generate test scenarios and sequences. Continue development of an EM software control system emulator to validate the performance and interfaces of the EM controls. Begin acquiring hardware, fabricate assemblies, and commence component level testing and assembly of the EM prototype unit.  The hardware includes the storage media, power electronics, interconnecting cabling, and associated equipment.\n\nPrepare for the future transition of Advanced Controls developed by ONR's Robust Combat Power Control Future Naval Capability (FNC) to this PE in FY21.  Advanced Controls take full advantage of power and energy resources within the ship's machinery control system to deliver mission systems the power and energy they require when required.  Advanced controls configure the system to operate at max efficiently when appropriate and switch to max performance when necessary though three-way communication and control between the machinery control system, mission planning and pulsed high power and energy weapon systems and sensors.  \n\nThis PE has developed a low-cost approach to testing, referred to as PHIL, which employs computer models that simulate and emulate actual operating machinery components and shipboard power and energy systems. PHIL testing replaces component models with hardware once hardware development is complete. PHIL testing costs less than full-scale hardware system testing, shortens development time, and affords the opportunity to identify and mitigate risks in a deliberate fashion from specification development to computer model development to hardware development resulting in a more affordable and robust end product.  PHIL testing provides early insight into the effects of high power and energy mission systems (i.e., laser, advanced radars, etc.) on a ship's electric power system, evaluates shipboard power and energy systems, and evaluates power system performance.  The PHIL test site is located at Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power System (FSU CAPS). PHIL testing at FSU CAPS has been ongoing since FY17.  Eight different PHIL demonstrations were planned with 5 to be completed through FY18 and 3 planned in FY19.  PHIL demonstrations to date have replaced component models with the United Kingdom's Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS), the ESM prototype unit developed by this PE, and Advanced Circuit Protection Devices developed by ONR.  The purpose of the FY19 demonstrations is to focus on DDG 51 FLT III and Future Surface Combatants with multiple high pulsed power loads; and to de-risk EM, advanced electrical architectures, power conversion equipment, and controls for implementation into an Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES). \n\nConduct feasibility studies, cost based assessments, and begin developing technical and performance specifications for an Integrated Power & Energy System (IPES) in support of future surface combatant and  mission system power and energy requirements.

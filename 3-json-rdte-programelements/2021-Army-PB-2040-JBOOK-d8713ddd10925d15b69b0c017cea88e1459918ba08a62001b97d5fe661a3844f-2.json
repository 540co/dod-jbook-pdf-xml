            "val": "This program element encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for artillery weapons systems.  \n\nProject 509 supports the Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, which is a Joint Service program between the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and US Army which provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. The LW155 was first introduced into the USMC in April 2005 and the Marines have fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades, National Guard and Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT). The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 30 kilometers (km) and assisted projectiles to 40km.  It is a successful joint service program between the USMC and US Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer.  The howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system, since it has been in the field for more than ten years.   \n\nCurrent development efforts are focused on extending the range of the LW155 to reduce the threat of being out ranged by potential adversaries and meeting the range key performance parameter objective distance (greater than 40km) as stated in the Joint US Army, USMC Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for Advanced Towed Cannon System, but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity, cost and schedule.  The USMC and US Army are leveraging technology being developed as part of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program by the US Army.  The ERCA program is a suite of technologies, cannon, ammunition and fire control, to increase the range of cannon artillery to exceed peer competitors range (greater than 70km).  An operational demonstration of the M777 Extended Range (M777ER) howitzer will be conducted at the end of FY 2020 to assess the performance of best available projectiles and objective hardware of M777ER howitzer.\n\nProject HB6 supports the mobile howitzer program.  The Mobile 155mm Howitzer is a Self-Propelled, 155mm Wheeled Howitzer that provides lethal, proactive counter-fire essential for the survivability of the maneuver formations and other close support fires as required.  The Mobile Howitzer improves the Field Artillery Battalion's ability to maintain pace with its supporting maneuver formations and survive against responsive, counter-fire from near-peer threats with rapid displacement and emplacement times.  The mobile howitzer will improve tactical mobility and system survivability compared to existing towed howitzer systems.  Development efforts, prototyping and evaluations will focus on attributes such as improved emplacement and displacement times, driving speed, and crew protection capabilities, all without sacrificing lethality versus existing towed howitzer systems.  Program activities in FY 2021 will be focused on using Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to evaluate vendor mobile howitzer systems against system requirements. Evaluation will include safety testing, US ammunition compatibility testing, and assessment of mobility, survivability and transportability."

The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan, receiving high marks for its performance.  It replaces all howitzers in all USMC missions and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 30 kilometers (km) and assisted projectiles to 40km. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 40km with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms.

The USMC and US Army are leveraging technology being developed as part of the ERCA program by the US Army.  The ERCA program is a suite of technologies, cannon, ammunition and fire control, to increase the range of cannon artillery to exceed peer competitors range (>70KM).

The Mobile 155 millimeter (mm) Howitzer is a Self-Propelled, 155mm Wheeled Howitzer that provides lethal, proactive counter-fire essential for the survivability of the maneuver formations and other close support fires as required.  The Mobile Howitzer improves the Field Artillery Battalion's ability to maintain pace with its supporting maneuver formations and survive against responsive, counter-fire from near-peer threats with rapid displacement and emplacement times.  The mobile howitzer will improve tactical mobility and system survivability compared to existing towed howitzer systems.  Development efforts, prototyping and evaluations will focus on attributes such as improved emplacement and displacement times, driving speed, and crew protection capabilities, all without sacrificing lethality versus existing and future towed howitzer systems.   Program activities in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 will be focused on evaluation of vendor mobile howitzer systems against system requirements."

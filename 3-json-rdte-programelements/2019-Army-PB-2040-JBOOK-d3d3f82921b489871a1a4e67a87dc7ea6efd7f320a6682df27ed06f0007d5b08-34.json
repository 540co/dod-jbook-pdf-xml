This capability greatly enhances the ground commander's battlespace awareness by integrating additional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms with Army Mission Command Systems (MCS) during the find, fix, and finish process. The increased battlespace awareness contributes to more effective and efficient use of fire support platforms like artillery. NRT updates to the intelligence picture allows forces to rapidly tailor fire support plans to make better use of existing assets. Providing NRT updates aids weapon and ammunition selection decisions based on current enemy disposition. FY 2019 request includes $0.799 million for these activities in support of Operation Inherent Resolve for ISIL.\n\nThis capability supports operational gaps and supports documented Army requirements. This funding provides resources to complete integration efforts into Army MCS. Initial integration testing is complete and shows the ability to produce the desired end state of passing intelligence data to the end user. Development efforts include interface refinement and measurement of message latency under a variety of realistic environments, which culminates in participation in live fire events. During the ongoing development of this capability, the project will receive and respond to feedback from the warfighter to ensure that the capability meets the warfighter's needs.\n\nHQDA G-2 and the Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Security Operations Center (ISOC) are charged with integrating, informing, and leveraging security and counterintelligence authorities in support of the Department of the Army Insider Threat Program mission to continuously deter, detect, and mitigate insider threats to Army information, networks, facilities, and personnel.  \n\nThe Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Modernization Project supports ongoing rejuvenation and development of new critical CI and HUMINT systems, applications, tools, equipment, and capabilities necessary to defeat the foreign intelligence, international terrorist, and insider threats while enhancing our HUMINT collection capability.  The required tools provide Army and DoD leadership, commanders, and warfighters the intelligence necessary for making advantageous operational planning, policies, and timely decisions. Funding will transfer to 0606003 FI9 Counter Intel and Human Intel Modernization in FY 2019."

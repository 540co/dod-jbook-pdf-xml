Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) developmental efforts address Personnel Recovery capability shortfalls & gaps identified in the Personnel Recovery Initial Capabilities Document approved by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 120-12 on 8 Aug 2012. Activties include funding for research and development, support equipment, contract services and all associated costs specifically identified to support the JPRA headquarters at Ft. Belvoir, VA and other JPRA operating locations.\n\nIn FY16, the Common Distress Reporting System (CDRS) began development.  CDRS will integrate all personnel locating devices into the existing reporting device architecture & Combat Survivor Evader Locater base stations to provide one common operating picture for timely and efficient recovery operations of isolated personnel.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

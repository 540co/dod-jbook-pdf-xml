These sources will ensure compliance with federally mandated environmental statutes and significantly lower noise and thermal signatures (thereby improving battlefield survivability), improve fuel and electrical efficiency, reduce weight, enhance portability, improve reliability, availability and maintainability, and reduce operational and support costs.  FY17 funds will continue to develop the Management and Distribution Control (MDC) Microgrids performance specification to include developmental testing and the Prime Power Connection Kit (PPCK); and complete the Large Advanced Mobile Power Sources (LAMPS) EMD phase.  Funding in FY18 will close out the LAMPS EMD phase; continue MDC Power Distribution Unit (PDU), PPCK EMD phase, and 20 Amp (3kW) power distribution."

Major data deliverables will include the Technical Data Package (TDP), provisioning data, logistics management information, technical manuals, test reports and cost data reporting.  The Government will purchase the TDP from the vendor with the intent of using it in future competitive re-procurements for LAMPS.  A Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Level of Repair Analysis (LORA), Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) and a Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) will be completed to verify that the TDP accurately describes the qualified production sets.  \n\nThe Management and Distribution Control (MDC) program effort will use a multi-phase acquisition strategy, continue to consolidate requirements and provide solutions to known capability gaps.  The MDC product line will include a Power Distribution Unit (PDU) designed to interface with the Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) automatic power plant\/microgrid, the PDU being developed in conjunction with the LAMPS program, the Prime Power Connection Kit (PPCK) and other products to provide the full range of power distribution equipment to support present and future Joint power system requirements."

The project will increase the available knowledge at the base level and provide an analytical foundation for sound investment decision making. The continuous improvement modeling and simulation analysis tools will match the evolution of threats and technologies. Using a system of systems engineering approach, the Contingency Base Infrastructure Product Directorate's focus ensures optimum integration of materiel across the base camp to facilitate the maximizing of Warfighter effectiveness. CBI\u2019s analytical results will allow leadership to make data driven, informed decisions on the acquisition and employment\/deployment of equipment. This enables contingency bases to be established, operated and managed as a system (system of systems) and the equipment acquired for the base to be compatible and efficient while providing the maximum overall support to the Warfighter. This approach supports Program(s) of Record (PORs) to maximize improvements in Operational Energy and ensures efficiencies across all Areas of Responsibility (AOR)."

The MSV(L) is a multifunctional waterborne mobility platform, which displaces the current Landing Craft Mechanized-8 (LCM-8) with greater capabilities in the areas of payload, speed, and functional draft (shallower water).  This vessel also provides new roll-through capability via stern access and bow ramps. The MSV(L) provides a waterborne corridor for movement and maneuver; expeditionary delivery of combat configured equipment, troops, and logistics, in austere anti-access\/area denial environments; and operational capability from ship to shore and along coastal waters, narrow inland water ways, and rivers. This vessels capability supports transporting multiple combat configured ready-to-fight payloads with crew (i.e. an Abrams tank; or two Strykers with bar armor; or four Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs); or two 20 ft. or one 40 ft. ISO container (Intermodal container); or a Heavy Expandable Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT); or a Load Handling System (LHS), and trailer).  The MSV(L) provides the capability to operate fully loaded at a speed of 15 knots in Beaufort Sea Scale 3 conditions, while being survivable (seaworthy) in Beaufort Sea Scale 7 conditions.  The vessels force protection attributes includes a subsurface surveillance device for obstacle detection and avoidance, protection from small arms fire, and two Common Remotely Operated Weapon Stations (CROWS II) for vessel defense, and the capacity to mitigate detection through reduction of thermal and acoustic signature.  The MSV(L) provides increased capability that moves combat configured forces and supplies more efficiently than the LCM-8.\n\nFY18 funding will primarily support maturation of the contractor's design, start of full scale prototype build, and potentially enable program acceleration."

The contract will award one 10 year contract to a single vendor comprised of a 4 year EMD followed by the production and development phase.  Model basin testing will occur, after successful execution of PDR. This sequence of events mitigate risks prior to the authorization of building the full size prototype.  The full size prototype will undergo testing which will inform the Capability Production Document (CPD).  Following MS C approval, the Government will authorize the contractor to initiate LRIP and subsequently FRP."

These Engineering and Manufacturing Development programs enable the Army to improve maneuver sustainment operations to meet the demands of the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams and the Future Force.  The mission includes receiving and transferring petroleum from trucks, ships, pipelines and permanent and temporary storage facilities; moving petroleum from storage to and within corps and division areas; fuel quality surveillance testing; and dispensing in support of tactical operations, including rapid refueling of aircraft.  The mission covers water purification and waste water treatment, reutilization, storage, distribution, alternative water source acquisition, disposal, and quality control of water.  The Army cannot fight without clean fuel and water.  These Research and Development (R&D) missions support the development and enhancement of rapidly deployed Petroleum and Water equipment which enables the Army to achieve its vision by providing a highly mobile and self-sustaining system in hostile joint operations areas."

The Combat Engineer and Construction equipment consists of the Surveying, Firefighting Individual Requirements Equipment Support (FIRES), Urban Search and Rescue (USR), Fire Protection Equipment Type I, II and III, Tactical Fire Fighting Truck Tools (TFTT), Family of Electrical Personal Protective Equipment (FoEPPE) Family of Power Utility Kits (FoPUK), Distribution Utility Construction Kits (DUCT) and Soldier Portable Kits, Lineman's Tool Kit, Concrete and Masonry, Electricians, Plumbers, Pipefitters, Family of Light Sets (FoLS), Airfield Damage Repair Kit (ADRK), Diving Equipment, Surface Swimmer Support Sets, Surface Supplied Diving Set, procurement of new Technical\/Special Tools, Pioneer Support Set, and the Pioneer Land Clearing and Building Erection Set. Project will explore Additive Manufacturing for Engineer sytems. Funding will support the procurement of market samples and testing for Soldier Portable Sets, Kits, and Outfits (SKO), and critical life support equipment such as the Deep Sea Set, Underwater Construction Set, Closed Circuit Scuba Set, Supervisor Propulsion Emergency and Recovery SCUBA (SPEaRS), Divers' Supplemental Issue Set(DSIS), Vertical Skills Engineer Construction Kit (VSECK), and Family of Boats and Motors (FOBAM). All of these programs are in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase.\n\nBUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION: These systems provide state-of-the-art deployable, critical life support and combat engineer and construction equipment along with engineer safety and special unit support equipment supporting the joint warfighter.  These programs will minimize transportation requirements and reduce the logistical footprint by eliminating obsolete equipment and reducing the number of programs. Funding shall allow for development of dual use systems that support wartime use by soldiers to include Special Forces and peacetime operations that include national disaster relief and homeland security operations.  Much of this equipment has an inherent short Economic Useful Life (EUL). Investments used to revise, update and obtain equipment within this portfolio has resulted in reductions in footprint, and increases in safety, effectiveness, and readiness."

These systems are equipped with industrial quality tools required for Two Level Maintenance that reduce common tool redundancy, provide tool standardization, minimize transportation requirements, reduces logistical footprint, and are backed by a Lifetime Warranty\/Replacement Program which reduces sustainment costs. This is accomplished by employing a system of systems approach to maintenance acquisition. The system of systems approach builds a maintenance capability upon each system, allowing a logical and natural approach to the Army's overall two level maintenance strategy. These inter-connected systems distributed throughout the Army at multiple levels and echelons provide a holistic repair capability in all scenarios and environments. These systems provide the Maintenance and Combat Commanders an unprecedented capability to repair wheeled, tracked, aviation, ground support and weapons systems on site at one location at one time. This approach to maintenance acquisition increases efficiencies and supports the current force while providing modular configurations designed to meet the specific needs of the Army maintainer in today's complex transforming environment. All of these programs are in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase.\n\nBUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION:  The need to develop and maintain a System of System maintenance approach is critical due to the growing complexity of today's military equipment, operational tempo, modularity, and current and evolving Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The individual maintenance systems are comprehensive, interconnected and capable of solving and repairing any maintenance problems. The System of Systems approach does not advocate specific tools, methods or practices; instead it seeks to promote a streamlined comprehensive set of systems for solving maintenance challenges where the interactions of doctrine, technology, time and tactics techniques and procedures are the primary drivers.  Funding for projects shall include test article procurement and testing of soldier portable maintenance SKOs, load banks and refrigeration tool kit; investigation of new technologies for next generation mobile maintenance equipment shop sets including the Shop Equipment Welding (SEW) and Shop Equipment Contact Maintenance (SECM); development of additional Standard Automotive Tool Set (SATS) maintenance modules, Armament Repair Shop Set 2, Mobile Ammunition Processing Facility (MAPF), Special Tools initiatives, Shelter Mounted system Development; packaging development; and technical support for emerging JCIDS materiel requirements documents. Upgrades to existing shelter mounted systems to include a 3-D printing\/additive manufacturing\/digital library capability as well as use of lower cost set components. Modernization upgrades to increase effectiveness while improving efficiency, reliability and maintainability while supporting emerging Army systems to include the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV)."

The IECUs will provide improved cooling, heating and dehumidification to soldiers and materials systems in combat, combat support and combat service support units. The IECUs are required to replace currently fielded ECUs in order to comply with statutory and regulatory restrictions on the use of Class II ODCs (such as HCFC-22) and to improve the performance of military ECUs. They are form, fit, and function replacements to the current MIL-STD ECUs. Technical improvements over existing ECUs will yield significant fuel and weight savings, reduction in scheduled maintenance and increased reliability. The new family of IECUs will utilize a new refrigerant which complies with mandated Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Funding supports the development of trailer-mounted systems, shelter system integrations, as well as supporting the new ECU requirements coming from the Army Standard Family of Soft Walled Shelters (ASF-SWS) and Army Standard Family of Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF-RWS) Capabilities Development Documents (CDDs).  In addition, the field has identified an emerging requirement for an integrated fuel-fired \/cooling system. These variants will further standardize cooling units in the field, enable cooling of larger shelters and structures, offer increased mobility, and may be used to cool multiple tents with one unit.  Funding also supports continued evaluation of IECUs and variants at Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) to support new operational concepts and supports development of new ECU and refrigeration products to ensure compliance with changing and more restrictive environmental regulations."

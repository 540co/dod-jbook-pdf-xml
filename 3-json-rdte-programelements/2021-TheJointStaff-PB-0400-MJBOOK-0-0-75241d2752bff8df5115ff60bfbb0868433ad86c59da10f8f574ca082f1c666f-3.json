These concepts include concepts of operations and employment that advance Joint Force operational effectiveness and enable the introduction and incorporation of new capabilities. The Joint Concepts program supports the Chairman's responsibility to express a vision for the future joint force; addressing operational problems on a 20-year horizon; identifying joint force development and design implications; and identifying capabilities required to mitigate and solve future joint warfighting gaps. The goal is to enable investment decisions balancing near and long term risk. Threat-informed joint concepts drive capability development and promote horizontal integration for force development and design across the Services, Combatant Commands, Defense agencies, OSD and Joint Staff. Key deliverables include:  \n\nFamily of Joint Concepts (FOJC): Based on the National Military Strategy (NMS) and providing operational and joint functional approaches to future adversary based challenges or opportunities. These concepts prioritize Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Countering Violent Extremist Organizations (hereafter referred to as the 2+3).  The FOJC drives capability development and alternative approaches to operating in support of a globally integrated force benchmarked against current and long-term pacing threats.  The FOJC includes the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations, Joint Warfighting Concept, Joint Operating Concepts for the 2+3 challenges, Joint Supporting Concepts that address joint warfighting functions, Concepts of Operation and Concepts of Employment.\n\nCapstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO): Provides the Chairman's vision for future joint operations and establishes aim points for the development of the future Joint Force. The key theme is globally integrated operations and directs joint concept driven, threat-informed capability to regain competitive advantage.\n\nJoint Warfighting Concept (JWC): Identifies innovative and alternative approaches and design options for the employment of the Joint Force out to 2030.  \n\nJoint Operating Concepts: Describe new ways of operating and associated capability requirements to address the 2+3 threat out fifteen years into the future.  \n\nConcepts of Operations (CONOPS): Describe how the actions of the joint force components and supporting organizations are integrated, synchronized, and phased to accomplish a specific mission or function within the construct of a future scenario.  CONOPS support evaluation of new ways of operating, future force posture mix, advanced capabilities, and authorities in exercises, wargames, and experiments.\n\t\nConcepts of Employment (CONEMPS): Describe, in broad terms, the application of specific technology, process, weapon system, or unit to perform a particular task or procedure.  They are the most specific of all military concepts and contain a level of guidance sufficient to inform the establishment of programmatic requirements. CONEMPS\u2019 focus on the cross-domain employment of capabilities and techniques in areas like space, cyberspace, and the electro-magnetic spectrum (EMS) to enable joint information advantage.\n\nJoint Operating Environment (JOE) and the Gamechangers report: Developed in partnership with DIA, this report describes the future security environment and projects the implications of change for the Joint Force. The documents describe the circumstances that may alter the security environment and explores how the intersection and interaction of these changes might impact the character of war in the future. They provide a framework to think about the full range of Joint Force missions and how they may evolve over time in order to support development of threat-based future Joint concepts and concepts of operations."

This complex task requires technologies that provide integrated information obtained by linking force structure quantitative data (derived from the GFM organizational servers) to qualitative data of Capability, Readiness, Availability and Employment\/Location data (C.R.A.E.) resident in GFM mission applications and associated data bases. The Joint Staff is responsible for GFM allocation and will employ a strategy for efficiently providing Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.\n\nDoD must meet national military objectives that range from large force scenarios to small-scale activities. Our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic effects. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to exchange information in a manner that rapidly and accurately enables force sourcing activities to support SecDef decisions. The Joint Staff is mandated to utilize the Service\u2019s organizational server EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the health and worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces. Key deliverables include incrementally developed, operationally realistic capability enhancements focused on resource-informed planning and GFM sourcing functionality required by numerous Joint Staff requirements documents.\n\nThe Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) enterprise force structure data integration efforts enables Project ORION: a Global Laydown Server and a Joint Force Capabilities Catalog along with functional applications that support a global visibility capability. This capability enhances resource-informed planning, global force management and joint deployment. Global visibility capability also supports future force integration and concept implementation needed to support timely and dynamic response to Combatant Commanders\u2019 contingency requirements. Project ORION creates a technical environment that enables rapid integration of the JOPES replacement with remaining GFM data that supports planning and execution of U.S. Military Operations. Project Orion provides operational force structure and the means to allocate and attach units. This capability is the cornerstone for fulfilling the CJCS-directed requirement to integrate force planning, support planning, and deployment planning and execution of military operations. The ORION environment supports all variants of planning and execution processes by providing portal access to authoritative data aggregated in the Global Laydown Servers and associated display of force capabilities, readiness, employment, and availability of the force. This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force management."

            "val": "DMEA\u2019s mission is to leverage advanced technologies to provide microelectronics solutions across the entire spectrum of technology development and system acquisition phases.  It is critical to National Security for the Department to maintain technological superiority through microelectronics solutions even when industry is unable or unwilling to provide them.  DMEA provides an in-house capability to quickly develop and deliver timely, cost-effective, technically appropriate solutions to sustain weapon systems, to modernize their capabilities, increase their lethality, address new threats, and meet operational demands.  DMEA augments its in-house capability through extensive industry and government partnerships that enable streamlined access to a variety of microelectronics technologies and engineering services to enhance responsiveness, and that develop sources for Trusted microelectronics.\n\nDMEA\u2019s capabilities are critical in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks.  The Department has very little influence over the microelectronics industry; the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market.  Assured access to Legacy, State of the Practice (SOTP) and State of the Art (SOTA) technologies is therefore a major and growing challenge.  Threats to defense microelectronics include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments, consolidation and off-shoring of manufacturing, rapid obsolescence and diminishing technology availability coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. In addition, as the Department maintains its weapon systems longer than originally planned, extended use increases demand for sustainment and modernization, which further intensifies the need for DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities.  \n\nThe Technology Development program (P001) provides the Department with DMEA engineering expertise and laboratories to address the myriad microelectronics issues and to meet military requirements across the entire spectrum of technology research and development, acquisition, and long-term support. DMEA applies its specialized capabilities to resolve microelectronics issues for hundreds of distinct Department programs across the acquisition lifecycle every year.  In addition, DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.\n\nThe Trusted Foundry program (P003) provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs.  The Trusted Foundry program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components."

These funds also support DMEA\u2019s ability to partner with industry, other government agencies, and academia to enable streamlined access to a variety of microelectronics technologies and engineering services. \n\nThese funds enable DMEA to provide increasingly rare government microelectronics design, fabrication, and test expertise to DoD programs. DMEA\u2019s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions\u2014along with its unique technical perspective\u2014allows it to develop, manage and deliver novel, decisive, quick turn microelectronics solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, and cyber and combat missions.\n\nThese funds allow DMEA to maintain and enhance critical, Trusted microelectronics design, aggregation, fabrication, post-processing, assembly and analysis capabilities to ensure that the Department is provided with solutions that enable or maintain the warfighter\u2019s technological superiority over potential adversaries. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. In addition, funding provides for the research, development and support necessary to ensure availability of microelectronics technologies for weapon systems, particularly as the technologies advance and industry is increasingly unable or unwilling to provide them. \n\nDMEA looks to industry to see if it can provide the required solutions. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary solutions using its in-house capabilities. A critical element required to enable continued success is DMEA\u2019s protection of the industry partners\u2019 valuable Intellectual Property (IP) and processes. DMEA is a small, agile government-owned and operated organization, providing the structure and confidence necessary to assure them that commercial IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations. \n\nDMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. Programs that DMEA has recently provided critical support to include Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) System, C-5, V-22, F-15, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter, OSD Joint Fuze Technology Program, among many others.

Under DoDI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical\/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid altered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities available to be Trusted sources.  The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities.  This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies. Commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment.  This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies, and is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, along with most other key defense technologies, depend heavily on high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement often translates into significant force multipliers and capability advantages.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors. \n\nThe Trusted Foundry program provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs.  The program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components.  The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements.  DMEA will foster all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry, as well as the extension and implementation of key process technologies for trust at DMEA.  It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues.  Most importantly, access to Trusted Microelectronics is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies."

            "val": "The purpose of the Nuclear Matters program is to sustain the U.S. nuclear deterrent posture, counter nuclear threats, and to develop nuclear and conventional physical security equipment. The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.\n\nFunds address the need for technical experts to assist with standing up the Security Incident Response Council (SIRC) and the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group (NDERG).  The SIRC is an interagency council established by Presidential Policy Directive-35, \"United States Nuclear Weapons Command and Control, Safety, and Security,\" to provide oversight over nuclear weapons security, incident response capabilities, transportation of U.S. nuclear weapons, and to exercise oversight and coordination with sub-working group.  The NDERG is a senior DoD oversight body, chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to oversee and make decisions regarding implementation of recommendations from internal and external DoD nuclear enterprise reviews.\n\nAdditionally, OASD(NCB\/NM) serves as the focal point for DoD activities and initiatives related to the dual missions of sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent and countering the threat from nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation.  Funding will be sent to Sandia National Laboratories to lead a team comprised of Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to develop a nuclear deterrence model.  The modeling and analysis results will support the Nuclear Weapons Council strategic planning to include modernization strategies and stockpile composition assessments and investment tradeoffs.\n\nThis Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

The RSLP mission was established by the Secretary of Defense in 1972.  The small launch program complements the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program with multiple options to acquire dedicated spacelift and rideshare services for developmental, demonstration, and small operational space vehicles.  It provides mission planning, payload integration, vehicle acquisition, processing, launch operations, booster storage and disposition, aging surveillance, maintenance and logistics support for selected DoD responsive space and RDT&E launches.  Costs directly attributable to a specific launch or program (e.g., reliability of flight testing, maintenance of launch vehicle processing infrastructure) are paid by the user (Air Force, Space Force, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), etc.).  RSLP maintains exclusive control of deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper assets used in testing to include refurbishment, transportation and handling, storage, aging surveillance, and launch services.  RSLP also funds general research, development, prototyping, integration, and supplemental reliability of flight testing efforts for launch to enhance the reliability of the Minotaur and other fleet vehicles (e.g., updates to the Modular Mechanical Ordnance Destruct System).\n            \nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Rocket Systems Launch weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

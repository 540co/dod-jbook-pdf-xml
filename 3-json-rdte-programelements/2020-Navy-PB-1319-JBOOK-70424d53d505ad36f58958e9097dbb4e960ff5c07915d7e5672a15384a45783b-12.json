FY 2020 funding increase of $1.33M from PB 2019 to PB 2020 is to support the accomplishment of this routine maintenance.  Without the increase in funding, the Self Defense Test Ship risks being placed in Do Not Operate status, which will negatively impact the Navy's ability to conduct realistic live fire testing in support of CVN 78, Littoral Combat Ship and LSD 52 Class Amphibious Ship Self Defense Systems. \n\nProject 3206 - $1.2M FY 2020 TOA decrease from PB 2019 to PB 2020 is due to Underexecution Issue of $1.0M and realignment of $200k from PU 3206 to PU 3238 Threat Engineering. \n\nProject 0569: The funding decrease of approximately $7.0 million reflects a reduction in planned depot events for NAVAIR RDT&E aircraft - primarily driven by DON decisions to retire legacy FA-18 aircraft, and the grounding of NAVAIR C-130's due to propeller issues, resulting in delay of those depot inductions.\n\nProject 3238: Project was established to support the Acquisition Threat Evaluation Projects (ATEP). Funding was realigned within the PE from project 3206 T&E Enterprise. \n\nThe FY 2020 request was reduced by $2.5 million to reflect the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nSchedule: Not applicable."

This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft\/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Aircraft Structure Periodic Adjustments (ASPA), Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, Aviation Climate Assessment Survey System (ACASS) and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&E requirements.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead\/operational ship testing requirements for Extended Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-2, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN\/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), and LCS TEMP 1695.\n\nEnterprise Cost elements:\n\na) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.\n\nb) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LSD 52, DDG 1000, LCS and CVN 78.\n\nc) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LSD 50, LCS and CVN 78.\n\nd) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).\n\ne) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Information Assurance (IA) certifications, and financial management.\n\nf) Maintenance of Combat System (CS) includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.\n\nThe T&E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation Modeling and Simulation (M&S) data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test."

This program also produces critical, valid T&E assets that satisfy Commander Operational Test & Evaluation Force (COTF) and Director of Operational Test and Evaluation  (DOT&E) requirements as these same tools will be used to support and supplement test and evaluation and training against the assessed threats in both testbed and at-sea configurations, ensuring consistency between the development and T&E acquisition phases.  \n\nATEP is the surface navy cost effective, affordable, single, common threat modeling architecture that supports its Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), (and other subordinate programs) RDT&E activities throughout the acquisition life cycle and extending through operations and sustainment. ATEP satisfies Life Cycle Mission Planning (LCMP) requirements by providing the threat modeling architecture needs to support systems engineering trade-off analysis, T&E (DT and OT) and operations and sustainment (OA) through testbed evaluation activities.  ATEP is a critical component in ensuring requirements are achievable, affordable and testable.\n\nATEP provides the required threat models to ensure fleet operational readiness against the threat. Specifically, ATEP Satisfies Operational Test (OT) and Operational Assessment (OA) requirements including COMOPTEVFOR requirement (COMOPTEVFOR Memo, 3960, SER 00\/244 of 29 April 2016).  This requirement specifies ATEP is necessary to provide the surface navy validated Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat models for use in the M&S infrastructure supporting OT&E.  Moreover, ATEP satisfies COMOPTEVFOR requirement that threat models must be at a fidelity commensurate with the blue-force system representations and contain intel-derived lethality\/vulnerability data, physics-based six degrees-of-freedom models, reactive seekers and guidance, and other engineering data.  ATEP is necessary to evaluate mandatory Key Performance Parameters including operational effectiveness, and suitability to include a systems lethality and survivability, and achieving its performance requirements within operation and sustainment costs.\n\nATEP provides the threat models necessary to ensure the surface navy 1.) Avoids Technological Surprise and 2.) Eliminates Point Solutions. ATEP satisfies necessary Threat model requirements to conduct warfare systems analysis of alternatives including gaps analysis, and threat systems mission and performance analysis and effectiveness studies supporting both material and non-material solutions while supporting the development of Intelligence Community Tasking Threat. \n\nWith Threat Engineering efforts and development of ATEPs the Navy and PEO IWS will produce substantiated risk and cost based Fleet Level Engineering decisions producing predictable and timely fleet capability against stressing threats. Scalable warfighting performance will be evaluated against the appropriate threat environment, using sufficient, verified and validated models applied to produce Fleet Level Engineering requirements and gaps analysis. \n\nWithout Threat Engineering efforts and ATEPs the Navy and the PEO will incur unsubstantiated risk and cost in developing capability for the fleet. Scalable warfighting performance will not be evaluated against the threat environment, sufficient models will not be developed or applied to produce Fleet Level Engineering requirements and gaps analysis."

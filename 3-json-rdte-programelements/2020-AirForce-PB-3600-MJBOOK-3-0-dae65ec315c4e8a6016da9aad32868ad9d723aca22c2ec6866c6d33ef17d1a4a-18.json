When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ATCALS development funding currently focuses on Future Air Traffic Control (ATC) Technologies within the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System (ATS) and Deployable Radar Approach Control (DRAPCON) programs as described below.\n\nNextGen ATS. This is the United States initiative for the transformation of the National Airspace System (NAS) over the next 20-30 years to enhance safety, security, efficiency, affordability and capacity, meeting the requirements of all users of the NAS. This interagency effort is designed to identify the warfighter's emerging airspace needs, analyze technologies, formulate requirements and positions, and advise DoD aviation and air traffic communities in order to enable safe and efficient military flight operations in a changing global airspace. Future ATC Technology will be built on key elements from the NextGen ATS projects, leveraging those systems and studies to further advance ATC systems under development. As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned). These efforts will involve aircraft avionics as well as fixed based and deployable air traffic control and landing systems. FY20 efforts will continue to research and develop new technologies in the areas of aircraft launch and recovery, airspace interoperability, and optimization of flight capability, as well as continue enabling Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) access to the NAS, develop a NextGen ATS DoD Strategic Roadmap, add new capabilities to Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) software, and outline DoD and Air Force equities and requirements via in-depth analysis of FAA NextGen ATS programs and timelines. Portfolio analysis will be captured in DoD NextGen ATS charters to guide Services through a broad and complex NextGen ATS environment. To minimize integration costs, the AF will work across the DoD to adopt a common framework with practical guidelines to evaluate the validity of NextGen ATS initiatives with the Air Force's mission. These efforts support the development of operational strategies that realize the achievement of valid NextGen ATS initiatives in concert with acquisition strategies in integrated avionics advances for focus areas such as Aircraft Launch and Recovery for both fixed and expeditionary operations, Airspace Interoperability, Optimized Flight Capability, and any DoD\/USAF or civil US and International Mandates. FY20 tasks will also continue NextGen ATS strategic planning efforts, the conduct of service operational test and evaluation as required, and evaluation of new civil air traffic control and landing system technologies that may have military utility to include an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Tower System technology. In total, these efforts will focus on enabling DoD aircraft to take advantage of NextGen ATS envisioned efficiencies, developing policies\/procedures to reduce costs while ensuring airspace access, seamlessly integrating UASs into the NAS and international airspaces, improving the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determining future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhancing flight safety.\n\nDeployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 50 year old Air National Guard (ANG) AN\/MPN-14K and Active Duty (AD) AN\/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar and Operations Shelter subsystems with state-of-the-art digital systems.  Due to diminishing manufacturing sources, modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective.  On average, due to systemic equipment failures, no more than four of the existing 14 systems are deployable at any given time and none are fully mission capable.  Three of these systems are currently deployed.  Two of which are at a single location (one for spare parts).  D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance\/sequencing, air traffic control communications, automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations, and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe and secure communication capabilities (a deferred key system attribute).  D-RAPCON will also be deployed with a fixed base or deployable Instrument Landing System, a fixed or mobile control tower, and a fixed or mobile Tactical Air Navigation system to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  D-RAPCON will support the full range of tactical military, worldwide humanitarian, and domestic disaster relief operations.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) extends out 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) will increase from 120 nm to 200 nm.  The D-RAPCON Capability Development Document was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council on 8 Feb 11.  Related OPAF funds are in PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the ATCALS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The current acquisition strategy is focused on replacing 1960\/70s era deployable and fixed based equipment with mature off-the-shelf technology with remote maintenance capability while also looking to the future under the NextGen ATS initiative.\n\nCurrent contracting efforts include D-RAPCON development, NextGen ATS planning and implementation, and conduct of an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Control Tower technology.  The contracting strategy for D-RAPCON development is based on award of a competitive fixed price incentive firm contract emphasizing off-the-shelf technology and maximizing the use of non-developmental items. The contract includes engineering, manufacturing, and development and test with follow-on production options.  NextGen ATS Enterprise Architecture Implementation Tasks, Infill radar certification, and ATC Management of UASs are being executed via Military Inter-Departmental Purchase Requests, and Project Orders with various organizations (FAA, MITRE, Army, Air Force Research Laboratory, and Air Force Flight Standards Agency).  The Remote Virtual ATC Control Tower EOA contract award was a full and open competition using Other Transaction Authority procedures.        \n\nThe Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) Digital is the PEO for ATCALS and is also the delegated milestone decision authority.  Program management, contracts, logistics, and financial management support is provided by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Aerospace Management Systems Division (AFLCMC\/HBA) which is aligned under PEO\/Digital."

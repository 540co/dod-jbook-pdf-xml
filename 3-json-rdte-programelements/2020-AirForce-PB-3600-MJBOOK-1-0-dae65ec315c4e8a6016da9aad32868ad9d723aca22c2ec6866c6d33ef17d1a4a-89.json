            "val": "The Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) RDT&E FY2020 budget justification exhibits describe the Next-Gen OPIR Space, Ground, and Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) programs.\n\n1. Next-Gen OPIR Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) (Project 657009): SMI supports the SBIRS Program of Record (PoR) and Next-Gen OPIR by assessing future parts and material obsolescence, designing space and ground modifications focused on affordability and capability, and maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements, and technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for space and ground architecture enhancements. SMI includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current PoR constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded trade space and improve the competitive environment. The three major thrust areas under SMI are Demonstrations, Technology Maturation and Data Exploitation. The Demonstrations mature and demonstrate technologies with ground and on-orbit prototypes.  Demonstrations advance system performance and algorithms for tactical and strategic applications to enhance PoR capabilities.  Finally, demonstrations reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the current PoR. Technology Maturation assesses and addresses needs to support resiliency of PoR assets and future architectures that must respond to an evolving threat environment. Data Exploitation enables access to OPIR data sources to expand technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to support warfighters and other data users.\n\nReduce SMI saved $25.000M in FY 2020.  Reduce SMI identified excess need in engineering efforts for space modernization in FY 2020.  Funding decreases do not affect technology maturation for insertion into Next-Gen OPIR Block 1.  Funding contributes to the acceleration of the Next-Gen OPIR initial launch capability. \n\n2. Next-Gen OPIR Ground (Project 657106): Next-Gen OPIR Ground, also known as Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE), will consist of Command and Control (C2) migration to Air Force Space Command's Enterprise Ground Services (EGS), modernization of Mission Data Processing (MDP), and required development\/upgrades to Relay Ground Stations (RGS) to meet AFSPC guidance on the current and future space domain demands. The FORGE effort will implement an open framework for MDP and migration of C2 satellite operations to integrate with EGS. FORGE and EGS efforts will provide the flexibility and scalability to integrate new sensors and capabilities more efficiently in order to meet evolving warfighter needs. The Next-Gen OPIR ground also includes risk reduction efforts to enable cyber enhancements for the PoR and Next-Gen OPIR ground systems. EGS will introduce common ground services such as Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C) and automation. To support initial Next-Gen OPIR Space satellite launches without driving undue risk into the FORGE development schedule, the program will establish a risk reduction ground capability Next-Gen OPIR Interim Operations (NIO) option based on a limited Block 20 solution that can be exercised. \n\n3. Next-Gen OPIR Space: Is a transition from the legacy Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program. Next-Gen OPIR implements the direction of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 130-17, dated 21 December 2017, by developing the next generation of strategically survivable space-based missile warning OPIR platforms in both GEO and Polar orbits. This program will deliver improved core missile warning capabilities that are more survivable against emerging threats. The full Next-Gen OPIR constellation will consist of a minimum of GEO and Polar satellites in sufficient number to meet global warning coverage with no exploitable holes (5 GEO + 2 Polar) plus required backup and attrition and reconstitution reserve. The Air Force intends to acquire Next-Gen systems in block procurements. The Block 0 acquisition strategy consists of three GEO and two Polar satellites. The first GEO satellite is required no later than FY2025 and the first Polar satellite is required in FY2027. All five Block 0 satellites need to be on orbit by FY2029. Follow-on blocks will be addressed in future acquisition strategies.\n\nNext-Gen OPIR Space, Block 0 Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO)(NGG) (Project 657120): The Program Office intends to acquire the NGG capability in two contract actions. Phase 1 was awarded in August 2018 and encompasses requirements analysis, design\/development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Critical Design Review (CDR). Phase 2 will be awarded for the manufacturing, assembly, system integration and test, launch and early on-orbit test through the  delivery of NGGs 1-3 for operational acceptance of each space vehicle.  \n\nNext-Gen OPIR Space, Block 0 Polar (NGP) (Project 657121): The Program Office intends to acquire the NGP capability in three contract actions. Phase 0 awarded in June 2018, encompassing system and payload requirements analysis and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Requirements Review. Phase 1 will be awarded for design and development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Critical Design Review. Phase 2 will be awarded for the manufacturing, assembly, integration and test, and delivery of NGP satellites 1&2. \n\nNext-Gen OPIR Space, Block 1 (Project 657122): The Air Force plans to acquire subsequent blocks in a competitive environment. The Block 1 satellites will be based on the Enterprise OPIR Capability Development Document (CDD), validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The Next Gen OPIR Block 1 program acquisition will begin in FY2023 in time to deliver its first satellite by FY2030.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Next-Generation OPIR weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements, and technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for space and ground architecture enhancements. SMI includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current PoR constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded trade space and improve the competitive environment. The three major thrust areas under SMI are Demonstrations, Technology Maturation and Data Exploitation.\nThe Demonstrations mature and demonstrate technologies in ground and on-orbit prototypes, advance system performance and algorithms for tactical and strategic applications to enhance PoR capabilities and reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the current PoR. Technology Maturation assesses and addresses needs to support resiliency of PoR assets and future architectures responsive to the evolving threat environment. Data Exploitation enables access to OPIR data sources to expand technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to support warfighters and other data users."

The demonstrations explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem\/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture. The demonstrations support maturation of MDP algorithms for tactical and strategic applications which are critical efforts to enhance PoR capabilities and to reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems, reconstitution, or evolutions of the PoR.\n\nThe Wide Field Of View (WFOV) demonstration matures WFOV technology and validates multi-mission capabilities including the potential for a single sensor to simultaneously perform strategic and tactical missions. Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and to reduce risk for possible future architectures. The WFOV payload and bus are separate development efforts. The WFOV testbed program provides a bus capable of demonstrating on-orbit mission performance and mitigating the development risks for employing WFOV sensors. The testbed program will integrate, test, and launch a prototype, developmental WFOV payload with a government-owned free-flyer spacecraft.  The WFOV Testbed will host the WFOV payload. As an integrated Space Vehicle, the WFOV system will prove on-orbit mission performance of WFOV sensors. The WFOV payload will provide the critical on-orbit data required to develop and validate WFOV algorithms, as well as on-board MDP throughput requirements for strategic missile warning. \n\nThe Technology Demonstration space vehicle prototype(s) under development is responsive to emerging missile types and threats to the current missile warning architecture, as well as the rapidly evolving threats to the enterprise to inform the future OPIR architecture to include SBIRS, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other mission partners. The assets will be Class-C mission assurance prototype(s) with a 3-5 year designed mission life and an initial launch capability beginning in 2025. The technology demonstrations will incorporate resiliency capabilities while advancing the state of the art performance technology. The demonstrations will focus on the rapid advancement, technology insertion, and launch of future generations of missile warning technologies and system resiliency components. These assets will incorporate threat mitigation technologies and other resiliency features with the goal of demonstrating these technologies in ground and on-orbit. These demonstrations will facilitate tech insertion, validate technical performance, inform future OPIR requirements, and reduce technical risk to the enterprise."

SBIRS and other sensors provide a rich data set for exploitation. SMI data exploitation enables access to raw and processed data for data analysts and application developers to expand capabilities for battlespace awareness and other applications. SMI data exploitation efforts are complementary to, and enhance, the exploitation capabilities delivered by the PoR, prototypes, and inform future PoR exploitation efforts. SMI will develop tools and algorithms to enable users to apply OPIR data to support their mission needs. Data exploitation efforts also evaluate tools for C2, mission management, and MDP for risk reduction to evolve the PoR ground system to an open architecture that could support PoR and other future satellites and payload alternatives. SMI ground system development activities seek to demonstrate the performance of an evolved ground system architecture capable of supporting multi-satellite, multi-payload, multi-mission management and data processing for any infrared payload to achieve lower operating costs with enhanced net-centric and service oriented features along with a flexible expansion capability that was not designed into the current PoR ground system.  Support demonstration and prototype architecture planning and experimentation."

The FORGE effort will implement an open framework for MDP and migration of C2 satellite operations to integrate with EGS. FORGE and EGS efforts will provide the flexibility and scalability to integrate new sensors and capabilities more efficiently in order to meet evolving warfighter needs. The Next-Gen OPIR ground also includes risk reduction efforts to enable cyber enhancements for the PoR and Next-Gen OPIR ground systems. EGS will introduce common ground services such as Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C) and  automation. To support initial Next-Gen OPIR Space satellite launches without driving undue risk into the FORGE development schedule, the program will establish a risk reduction ground capability Next-Gen OPIR Interim Operations (NIO) option based on a limited Block 20 solution that can be exercised."

The program office awarded two sole source contracts (one to a GEO prime and one to a Polar prime) under the authority of two class Justification & Authorization documents. Next-Gen GEO Phase 1 was awarded in FY 2018, encompassing requirements analysis, design\/development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Critical Design Review.  Next-Gen GEO Phase 2 will be awarded (FY 2020 timeframe) as a modification to the Phase 1 contract. This will complete the manufacturing, assembly, system integration and test, launch and early on-orbit test through the  delivery of GEOs 1-3 for operational acceptance of each space vehicle.

The Air Force plans to acquire subsequent blocks in a competitive environment. The Block 1 satellites will be based on an approved Enterprise OPIR Capability Development Document. Funding in execution years will be realigned within the Next-Gen OPIR program element to respond to execution requirements."

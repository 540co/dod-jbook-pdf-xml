Included are investigations of technologies, novel materials, and test methods related to personnel armor, helmets, hearing protection, eyewear, uniforms, handwear, footwear, and other clothing and individual equipment items. This Project also supports the investigation and development of novel combat identification technologies, electro-textiles for power generation and distribution, the study and exploration of algorithms for autonomous micro and nano robotics and sensors, and human-machine teaming technologies to enhance the dismounted Soldier's Situational Awareness (SA) and Manned- Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) with autonomous systems. In addition, this Project supports the development and refinement of essential analytic tools needed to predict and\/or assess the combat effectiveness of next generation Soldier systems to identify and develop methods to assess human responses to sensory, physical, cognitive, and affective stimuli and stressors.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priorities and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is coordinated with PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602787A (Medical Technology Initiatives), and PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology)."

                            "val": "The Army Human Resource System (099) contains the following programs: Go Army Education managed by the Human Resource Command, Commanders Risk Reduction Dashboard managed by Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) and Regional Level Applications Software (RLAS) managed by United States Army Reserves (USAR).\n\nIn support of recruiting and retention for a more educated workforce, GoArmyEd is the virtual financial management portal and decision-support tool for 1) AD, USAR and ARNG Soldiers to request Tuition Assistance (TA); 2) Cadets to request Scholarship payments and 3) Department of the Army (DA) Civilians and Apprentices to request professional development funds. GoArmyEd is an enterprise system that enforces eligibility for higher education funds and creates efficiencies with its automated processes.  Soldiers, Scholarship Cadets, DA Civilians and Apprentices use it to pursue post-secondary educational goals and professional development objectives; Army Education Counselors use it to provide educational guidance; Career Program Managers and Training Managers use it to manage civilian training; and Academic Institutions use it to deliver degree and course offerings and to report user progress and degree completions for 206K Soldiers, Cadets and Civilians.\n\nCommanders Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD) began with the identification of capability gaps arising out of the 2010 Red Book and 2012 Gold Book, two extensive studies directed by senior army leadership to examine suicide prevention (Red Book) and the Army's health and discipline (Gold Book). The studies illustrated that Commanders faced capability gaps in their ability to identify high risk behavior and risk factors, analyze soldier and unit risk, and identify risk trends and develop intervention strategies. CRRD provides Commanders at echelons Company through Major Army Command the ability to visualize and take preventive action to mitigate risk factors impacting their soldiers and formations by going to one dashboard and seeing data from multiple data sources.  CRRD has additional enhancements projected for the programmed $621K to improve the Increment (INC) II capability release. \n\nThe United States Army Reserve (USAR) utilizes the Regional Level Application Software (RLAS) as an enterprise system for duty attendance, military pay, Soldier records management and training calendar management to access, transact, store and manage Soldier and unit data required to conduct synchronized USAR operations. Unlike the Army Active Component (AC) where Soldier military pay is centrally managed and input at the installation level, the USAR utilizes RLAS to manage and input decentralized Soldier pay transactions at the unit level. RLAS consists of four modules: Pay, Personnel, Training, and Resource Management. Research and Development (R&D) authority and funding will provide RLAS with investment funds for necessary system development and system modifications. R&D funding amounts increase slightly towards the end of RLAS lifecycle (FY 2019 and 2020) in order to fully support the Integrated Pay and Personnel System - Army (IPPS-A) transition.  Annually, USAR will provide sustainment funding.  R&D authority and sustainment funding will meet the  USAR Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and Office of the Secretary of Defense Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) opinions regarding defense information Technology (IT) system for R&D activities. Necessary RLAS system development and system modifications include: 1) IPPS-A interface requirements; 2) implementing Microsoft .net Framework 4.5 standards; 3) implementing new Operating Systems (OS), system utilities and other technology products. Enhanced development and modification to RLAS will improve RLAS system capabilities and bring RLAS into compliance with various Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and audit readiness requirements. RLAS will continue to process duty attendance, military pay, Soldier personnel transactions and training calendars until the system is fully subsumed by IPPS-A."

Three modules support human resources business functions (In\/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over $9 billion combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory. The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. \n  \nCoalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 2005.  \n\nArmy Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicide attempts are collected and stored in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement. ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.\n\nISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Funding supports research and development to comply with Department of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.0 million."

The near and mid-term focus of the MC4 program is to engineer, design, integrate, test, acquire and field the Army automation infrastructure capabilities supporting fielding of the Defense Healthcare Management Systems Electronic Health Record integrated software application suite, future modernized capability, and other Army requirements. The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components. Since Electronic Health Record software is a major component of the MC4 System and being developed in increments by the Joint Program, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and planned upgrades. The MC4 Program works with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities. These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date. This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and planned upgrades. This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities, and forward into the future with a fully modernized system. Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, cloud computing capability environment, etc.) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available. Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and planned upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing."

AIE aligns authorities, responsibilities, and resources, for Total Army accessions. It provides the Army's strength through its four missions: (1) Enlist Soldiers, (2) Commission Officers, (3) Fulfill In-Service requirements, and (4) Support and sustain. AIE will replace 11 legacy systems with 33 modules of the current legacy Accessions IT systems which have experienced frequent outages and unstable performance, directly impairing the Army's ability to make its recruiting mission. Successful implementation is of utmost priority for the enterprise. AIE is  a COTS-based information technology (IT) software system  that will modernize the AE. It will be a fully integrated Army-wide enterprise level software system for the accessions workforce to acquire the best-qualified warfighting talent (officer\/enlisted\/internal recruiting requirements) to meet Army recruiting and accessions requirements. Key AIE functions \/ core capabilities include: lead generation & management, prospecting, interviewing, processing, pay & incentives, intelligence, marketing, training \/ leader development. This effort will ultimately ensure the accessions workforce has the information needed to engender commitments, lead future Soldiers, and engage communities in direct contact with young Americans. In FY 2021, AIE will continue prototyping efforts, adding required capabilities to deployed functionality. AIE prototyping started in FY 2019, continued in FY 2020, and will continue to execute within the DoD 5000.75 Acquisition, Testing and Deployment phase. The prototype will be matured to increase functionality to be deployed based on the planned iterative Capability Waves. The FY 2021 funding will continue to support iterative Wave requirements analysis, business process reengineering, design, capability configuration, interface development, capability integration, cybersecurity engineering (to include Risk Management Framework continuous monitoring), systems engineering, software licenses for configuration and early adopter user environment, System Test & Evaluation, and Cloud Hosting (applications and data storage) to expand the prototype solution to an additional 6,466+ recruiters while preparing deployment and training to an additional 15,611+ recruiters.\n\nHRC Accessioning IT: Additionally, this program supports the development requirements for the US Army Human Resources Command (USAHRC) which provides the IT solutions and automation support necessary to accomplish the Army's Accessioning mission. \n\nArmy Suicide Prevention: This Program Element (PE) develops a pre-entry or entry assessment package that enhances the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development). This PE enhances the Army's ability to identify individuals with a higher likelihood of having already experienced, or of potentially experiencing, sub- clinical behavioral issues, as well as to identify character strengths (e.g., resilience, grit), to ensure that the Army can meet mission requirements in the current and future operating environments. Research in this PE will result in more precise determinations of individual potential for future successful service, and more targeted identification of need for individual assistance (e.g., intervention, training, behavioral health) to increase likelihood of future success."

This application uses full motion video, graphics, and sound to train clients; and schedules clients for classroom-type instruction. It integrates a complete range of transition services and benefits for service members, Department of Defense civilian employees, and their family members as they transition from the military. TAP-XXI is a web-based, three-tiered application with a centralized database for all Transition sites. The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers.  The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers. The application also allows for access outside of Transition centers to support mobilizing and de-mobilizing during Yellow Ribbon Program events or delivery of services at home station.  There is no application processing on the desktops located at Transition Centers. TAP-XXI application suite consists of the following subsystems: Transition Assistance Program - Support (TAP-Support), Transition Assistance Program -Online (TAP-Online) and TAP Virtual (Immersive Terf). The infrastructure modernization will provide system stability, support expansion requirements, and ensure reliable customer support.\n\nHuman Resource Command (HRC) Core IT: This program supports efforts to plan, design, develop, and test Information Technology (IT) solutions to fulfill the Army's Warfighter Support Mission, accommodate emerging Army requirements, and fulfill Future Army needs.  Ongoing development efforts support multiple functional areas including logistics, personnel, transportation, training, medical\/health protection, and the sustaining base.  The focus of the rationalization effort is to identify value-added applications capable of serving a broader Army enterprise audience and garnering efficiencies through the elimination of outdated, legacy, and duplicative applications.  Applications are upgraded or enhanced to meet compliance with Army Common Operating Environment standards in accordance with Army Application Management Business Office (AAMBO). Additionally, program supports enhancements and modifications to the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS) and iPERMS-Secure (iPERMS-S), as well as development of interfaces based upon emerging requirements, Cybersecurity, functionality and compliance with Army standards.\n\nR-Builder is a living application database system that allows the Manning Program Evaluation Group (MM PEG) to update the database to include various cost drivers and factors used for programming, budgeting for all Army Service members pay, allowances, and benefits for the all-volunteer Army. R-Builder is used to develop the annual Program Objective Memorandum -Budget Estimate Submission (POM-BES), and to develop and manage the Army's military and civilian personnel in order to execute the President's National Security Strategy.\n\nThe Army Review Board Agency (ARBA) operates under the delegated authority of the Secretary of the Army as the final level of appeal for service members in uniform, veterans, and their family members, adjudicating tens of thousands of claimed errors or injustices annually. ARBA is staffed with 128 military personnel, civilians, and contractors, and additional 350 external Advisors and Boards Members. ARBA struggles with the substantial process and system-related inefficiencies. The Agency currently uses the ARBA Case Tracking System (ACTS) to facilitate case adjudication and the routing of corresponding hard copy case files (a.k.a. \"redwelds\"). This system was custom built in 1999, strictly for tracking the hand offs of redwelds. At its inception, ACTS was a huge leap forward; however, as the organization and technology evolved, the system has not been able to meet new Agency mission objectives and streamlining initiatives. This antiquated system costs the Agency multi-millions in annual sustainment fees and lacks the agility to address changing business requirements and organizational roles.\n\nArmy SHARP Data Management System (DMS) Integrated Case Reporting System (ICRS) enhancements will provide stabilization for sexual harassment (SH) data collection, reporting requirements, and analytic processes; ICRS maintains Army sexual assault (SA) legacy data collected prior to 2014 in the Sexual Assault Data Management System (SADMS) IAW public law.\n\nARIMS is the Army's policy and enterprise system deployed to meet statutory (36 CFR) and regulatory (AR 25-1, AR 25-400-2) requirements to manage records that document the policies, decisions, and actions of the Army both as a military department and federal institution. ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY 2018) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army's classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army's records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations.  Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems. These skill sets are not maintained by government staff and must, by DoD directive (C3I), be acquired from the private sector.\n\nFamily Advocacy System of Records (FASOR) is the information system used by the Army to manage child and adult based abuse incidents referred by the Family Advocacy Program (FAP).  FASOR  is used to capture\/perform  incident case management and allows for standardization of reviews and incident determinations. FASOR  is a key system used in FAP Army Central Registry (ACR) background checks when determining suitability of individuals to be placed into \"positions of trust\".  Finally, FASOR facilitates reporting and data analysis in support of internal, Army, DoD, FOIA and Congressional requirements."

ARBA?s leadership has aggressively driven business process reengineering to include end-to-end case digitization. However, ACTS? inflexibility stands in the way of Agency progress on many fronts and negatively affects the timeliness, costs, and quality of ARBA?s work products. Additionally, ARBA has undergone increasing congressional scrutiny, unfavorable media conclusions, and publicized court remands surrounding the quality and timeliness of its 18,000 annual adjudication outcomes. As a result, ARBA leadership has committed to Congress that it will drive fundamental change across the DOTMLPF-P spectrum.\n\nIn summary, these significant problems result in greatly extended processing times, bottle-necked and rushed adjudication activities, numerous redundant hand-offs, and at times incorrect or contestable board outcomes. ARBA?s current process requires labor-intensive hard copy printing, collating, transporting, filing, scanning, labeling, inventorying, shipping, shredding, mailing, and tracking of redwelds and their content.\n- ARBA ADS Modernization capability requirements can be summarized as follows: \n- Lifecycle Case Management ? End-to-end Structured Process\n- Complete Case Digitization (electronic cases, board scheduling\/voting, approvals, signatures)\n- Improved External Stakeholder Exchange and Case Transit\n- Leverage Historical Information\/Comprehensive Knowledge Management Capability\n- Performance Assessment Framework ?

                            "val": "This project funds information technology systems that support Army Training.  The five systems under FM8 are described below. Of those, the Army Training Information System (ATIS) is the Army's priority and the focus of the major investment in FM8.  ATIS directly supports two of the four Army Unit Readiness Priorities - Training and Leader Development and an enabler for the Manning and Equipping.\n\n1.  Army Training Information System (ATIS).  The Army currently lacks an enterprise level Common Operational Picture (COP) of the training environment.  The ATIS is designated a Defense Business System (DBS) that will develop, integrate, test, deliver, operate, and maintain an enterprise capability for the Army training and education communities. Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats. Annual costs to maintain current legacy systems is ~$75M. Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of training information systems that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting efficient use of training resources, (people, time, money, material) that directly impacts the ability for units to meet readiness objectives.\n\nATIS will replace the functionality in 28 primary and 70 supporting information training systems with a single, integrated, user-friendly and technologically current system that will support management of the following training functions for 1.8M users:  \n\n-  Training Development.  Provides ability to develop and coordinate information, including training packages, training events, courses, and exercises.\n-  Training Management.  Provides centralized ability to access and manage information, including individual and collective\/unit training that supports mission tasks and individual training records.\n-  Enterprise Scheduling.  Provides a single integrated set of applications to schedule training resources, including transportation, classrooms, ranges, supplies, and mandated legal\/social individual and unit training.\n-  Content Management.  Provides centralized access to training information anytime, anywhere, including educational and professional instruction.\n-  Resource Management.  Provides ability to manage availability\/sustainability of training enablers and resources. \n\nATIS is a Category II Defense Business System and will follow the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) in accordance with DoD 5000.75.  ATIS Acquisition, Testing and Development phase will be executed as a single-vendor logical follow-on to the competitively awarded prototyping effort under Other Transaction Authority (OTA), as specifically authorized by 10 U.S.C Section 2371b, in accordance with the Acquisition Strategy. OTA is a streamlined method for transitioning successful prototype projects into follow-on production.  Contract award scheduled for FY20, Q2.  \n\nFollowing are the Release capabilities:  \n\n-  First Release (R1) - Operational, Training and Readiness Support.  R1 shall provide, as a minimum, Training Management capability with elements from Training Development, Enterprise Scheduling with readiness reporting capability.  Training Management includes access to individual and collective\/unit training records aligned to mission tasks.  The Training Development encompasses assembling training information to include training plans, training events, courses, and exercises.  The Enterprise Scheduling enables users to schedule training classrooms or ranges for unit training.  The authorized released system shall be scaled to support, as a minimum, 500 sustained, concurrent users.  The Release shall ensure coverage of organizations across the spectrum of all six Warfighting Functions (Intelligence, Movement and Maneuver, Fire Support, Command and Control, Protection and Sustainment).  The Release shall support users that are geographically dispersed.  \n-  Second Release (R2) - Operational Force Support.  R2 shall provide, as a minimum, three capabilities in support of the Operational Force:  Training Management, Enterprise Scheduling, and Resource Management.  The Release shall support the expanded capabilities over a larger, more diverse and geographically dispersed section of the force with focus on FORSCOM and Brigades.  The Release shall support 12,000 sustained, concurrent users.  The Release shall support 1.02M unique active users annually.\n-  Third Release (R3) - Full Capability Support.  The final release shall deliver the remaining ATIS capability:  Training Development and Learning Content Management, as well as completion of remaining requirements across all five capability areas.  The Learning Content Management hosts the learning content and makes it available for Soldiers to take training anytime, anywhere. The Release shall support 50,000 Sustained, concurrent users.  The Release shall support 1.8 million unique active users annually.  The final Release will subsume all remaining legacy systems by FY 2024.\n\nThe next four systems are not part of the ATIS Development program. \n\n2.  DLPT5 Content Analysis, Categorization & Modeling Development of DLPT5 Content Analysis, Categorization and Modeling (CACM) capabilities. For integration within the DLIFLC MIT LL TIDWA Domino system. These capabilities are in direct response to DLIFLC's DoDI assigned responsibilities for DLPT item bank maintenance, psychometric analysis and informed pool management, and closely support the DLPT Validity Framework.  MIT LL Networked Pronunciation Feedback Program (NETProf) expansion will allow for further expansion and further utilization of the existing NetProF products for DLIFLC faculty and students. To reach higher levels of proficiency in foreign languages the planned dialog system would give an advantage to DLIFLC teachers to help students gain advances through practicing speaking using this new dialog system, and the connected NetProF improvement system for pronunciation for longer utterances. This feasibility study will help set new parameters for developing very advanced language teaching systems that otherwise could not be supported. This is in support of the 2+\/2+\/2 plan.\n\n3.  Universal Course Authoring Tool \/ The UCAT (Universal Curriculum and Assessment Tool) will serve as the primary curriculum and assessment development tool for curriculum development projects in meeting the directives from higher headquarters to transition into a new, digital learning environment. UCAT will support the delivery of curriculum and assessment products on a variety of different platforms in support of both resident and non-resident programs. UCAT consists of server-side applications and associated web services, databases, and client-side components which are currently under development.\n\n4.  The Army Career Tracker is leader development tool that leverages Army's prior investments to integrate education, training, assignment, self-development and other systems by linking these valuable technologies and resources into a common user-friendly portal across 1.35 million users consisting of enlisted, officers, and civilians.  Users can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership. ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now. ACT allows users to manage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals. ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning. The unique inter-relationship between the user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and Army's success. Users manage their lifelong learning career objectives, monitor progress towards career development and goals, search multiple Army education and training resources, and receive personalized advice from their supervisor and Army leadership.  Completed development will modernize the Army Career Tracker (ACT) system to render web pages correctly base on the size of the screen. Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design that renders web pages based on the size of the device's display screen (e.g., computer, tablet, and phone). This allows the site to load quickly and ensures the display appears as if it were made expressly for the device being used. RWD improves user experience by displaying messages, links, and controls in a logical manner regardless of the device. The actual presentation may not look the same across different devices; rather the rendering will depend on the Operating System (OS), screen size, screen resolution, and other factors. Implementing RWD on ACT would be a step forward toward allowing ACT to render better on tablets and other mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones).\n\n5.  Enhancement of Army Training Models (ATM) will provide the resources to build and sustain readiness requirements in a standardized process for automated methodology development and resource allocation in support of the Army's training needs."

ATIS will provide Army Commanders, leaders, Soldiers and civilians with a Common Operating Picture (COP) of the Training Environment (TE) that enables situational awareness, effective planning, preparation, execution, and assessments of training readiness.  ATIS will reduce the lifecycle costs of training by retiring more than 28 duplicative, stove-piped systems and improve performance with a net centric, standards-based, architecturally compliant system for the entire Army Training Environment.\n\nThe overarching acquisition strategy is divided into three distinct phases.\n-  Phase I (Prototyping) - Program Risk Mitigation. Characterized by the  selection of three vendors to develop, demonstrate and deliver to the Government three ATIS Prototype systems and technical approach documentation.  The prototype project was awarded to the C5 Consortium Group to three vendors:  KBR, Perspecta, and CGI.  (Completed)  \n-  Phase II (Development) - Each Prototype will be evaluated at the end of the Phase I and one vendor will be selected for engineering, development and deployment of  the ATIS production system. This phase be executed as a single-vendor logical follow-on to the competitively awarded prototyping effort under Other Transaction Authority (OTA), as specifically authorized by 10 U.S.C Section 2371b. This is a streamlined method for transitioning successful prototype projects into follow-on production.\n-  Phase III - (Sustainment) - Upon full deployment of the system, a Sustainment Contract will be awarded for support and potential disposal of the system at the end of its useful life. ATIS intends to use Interim Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS) for initial sustainment beginning at Limited Deployment and will then transition to a hybrid life-cycle sustainment using a combination of CLS and government entities at Full Deployment (FD)."

Through CIMS, the USACIDC and the OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program \/ system that houses both classified and unclassified Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data.  CIMS leverages existing and future Army Law Enforcement (LE) enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) providing Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence functions as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  The Consolidated Operations Police Suite (COPS) was previously comprised of five separate applications: two of these applications have been rationalized under ALERTS; the remaining three (related to the Army Corrections discipline) require modernization to ensure continued function and security compliance. RDT&E dollars are required to further enhance & enable CIMS? consolidation\/rationalization of LE applications thereby providing the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime while also facilitating the management of those placed in corrections facilities.  At present, all requested CID RDT&E funding in program element 0605013A will be applied to CIMS initiatives."

MIRS provides automated support for conducting aptitude tests and medical examinations and administratively processing, enlisting and shipping applicants for the Armed Forces, Reserves, and Coast Guard. This includes support for automated versions of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) tests. MIRS initiates Social Security Administration (SSA) checks for identity verification; interfaces with US Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) to verify citizenship status for military service applicants to screen out individuals that may be security threats; and interfaces with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for background screening, using digital fingerprints to identify\/eliminate individuals with criminal records from entering military service. \n\nUSMEPCOM reports operationally to the Office of the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness and has an executive agency (EA) agreement with the Army. USMEPCOM serves all five uniformed services, but only receives funding from the Army to perform its mission.\n\nMIRS supports recruiting capabilities through electronic interfaces and data sharing, using standard Department of Defense (DoD) data elements with Recruiting Service systems. In the event a military draft is required, MIRS supports mobilization through electronic links with the Selective Service System (SSS) as well as automated support for conducting aptitude tests and medical examinations and administratively processing, inducting and shipping SSS registrants. \n\nCustomers\/beneficiaries of this investment: the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI), including components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, USMEPCOM, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Personnel & Readiness (P&R)\n\nRequested funding underpins system sustainability and scalability and improves cybersecurity to include protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Funding covers costs to redesign\/develop existing MIRS capabilities to operate efficiently in a cloud environment and to integrate with MHS-Genesis. This will allow for the closure of 65 Army data centers, in support of the Army Data Center Consolidation Plan (Army Directive 2016-38) and movement towards the Force of the Future mandate of all digital processing."

Program management functions were being performed by the Defense Digital Service (DDS). DDS managed an prototype development contract with a local consulting firm called Tandem (previously known as Devmynd. Based in Chicago IL). The DDS\/Tandem effort ended in December of CY2019 and produced a prototype. An in-house program management element of USMEPCOM will manage a follow-on contract to turn the prototype USMIRS 1.1 into a deployable system in FY21.\n\nThe efforts in FY21 and beyond will be to develop the non-core applications of USMIRS 1.1 (plug in items to the main system that communicate with other systems across all five uniformed services to include Army Accession Information Environment (AIE)). The contracting for this is being done through GSA Chicago as the owning contract agency. This will most likely be awarded in October of FY2021 with work beginning in October.\n\nMilestones:\n1 - Core USMIRS 1.1 prototype delivered in December of Calendar 2019.\n2 - Award contract to develop core USMIRS 1.1 prototype into a Minimum Viable Product that can be deployed to the field in 2Q FY2021.\n3 - Award contract to develop the USMIRS 1.1 non-core applications (plug ins) in 1Q FY2021 with work to begin 2Q FY2021.\n4 - FY22 and beyond will be to primarily establish the link between various systems (AIE, MHS Genesis Etc)."

Today, over 85% of this core Army Business Process is done manually and the tools that are available are on outdated technology platforms. GFIM will provide the tools necessary to dynamically develop, design, and document the Army's force structure at rest and in motion. GFIM will evolve both long-term and immediate bridging solutions that integrate and automate Army operational business processes, using an interoperable, collaborative environment, to enable the seamless exchange of authoritative data across the operational community of practice to provide rapid, accurate, and auditable outcomes to support risk informed senior leader decisions. GFIM will provide the core data necessary for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, other Business Mission Area (BMA) systems and Warfighting Mission Area (WMA) systems to efficiently and effectively execute business processes in support of Army Title 10 responsibilities and war fighting operations.\n\nThe Student Information Repository (SIR) Application will replace several independent applications and business processes used to track student data including, but not limited to, personal information, grades, attendance, official records, transcripts, teaching teams, student assignments, and surveys. It is a customized information system that is comprised of separate modules that are tied in together as one system.\n      \nThe Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.   It includes a new effort in FY 2014, the Army Contract Writing System, a replacement for the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS)."

The PPB BOS system standardize and integrate the transactional information systems used in the Headquarters Department of Army (HQDA)  Programming and Budgeting processes.   The program is streamlining programming and budgeting business processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The PPB BOS architecture reengineers, streamlines, and consolidates HQDA systems and financial feeder systems; aligns to the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA); implements powerful business intelligence analytical tools to support strategic planning, programming, and budgeting within HQDA; and provides access to GFEBS funds management and execution data through system interfaces with required SFIS compliancy integral to the PPB BOS data model.  The LEAP program will provide criminal intelligence querying and reporting capabilities in compliance with regulatory and policy standards for Army Law Enforcement regarding investigation of felony crimes.  LEAP captures criminal case investigative information regarding incidents, location descriptors, entities (name, social security number, rank, title, physical characteristics, sex, birth place, and date), agent assignment, crime description and identifiers, statements, property data, laboratory tests; verifies and stores this data for criminal intelligence purposes: and reports this information to the proper authorities from the Division Commanding Officer to the United States Grand Jury.  The system will extract necessary data for consolidation and input to Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) monthly reports, National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) monthly reports and the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII) daily updates.  The LIMS system will automate business processes that support the forensic examiners. These processes include, but are not limited to, analytics, materials management, management reporting, Freedom of Information Act requests (FOIA), legal discovery request, court preparation and outsource processing.\n\nCivilian Personnel Online - Portal (CPOL-Portal) is a one stop secure site which provides Army civilian employees and HR specialists access to a private portal with a complete set of employment related resources, links and web based applications that require single sign-on access - Army Regional Tools (ART). CPOL-Portal will provide an Integrated Management System (IMS) in support of Civilian Workforce Transformation (CWT). It will support Civilian human capital decision making and allow leaders and\nemployees to perform their roles more efficiently in support of Army goals and missions. CPOL Portal will provide the full spectrum of IT application support and access to Acquire, Develop, Distribute and Sustain components of the Army Civilian HCM Life-Cycle and link to G3 'Structure' IT Enterprise Applications.\n\nThe Fully Automated System for Classification (FASCLASS) is a centralized, web-based system that maintains civilian position descriptions and position related information across Department of the Army.  It provides classifiers and managers capability to create, edit, and verify position descriptions.  Also it offers robust search, report generation, and lookup & support capabilities.\n\nThe Overseas Entitlement Tracker (OET) provides the capability to accurately track Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). LQA is provided to reimburse employees for suitable, adequate living quarters at posts where the U.S. Government does not provide quarters. OET also tracks these other overseas entitlements for employees: Advance Pay, Danger Pay, Imminent Danger Pay, Foreign Differential, Home Leave, Post Allowance, Separation Maintenance Allowance, and Temporary Quarters Subsistence Allowance."

ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY 2018) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army?s classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army?s records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations. Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems.

In addition, it will establish a common data standard for force structure data by implementing the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI).  \n\nArmy Training Information System (ATIS) is an enterprise system that will provide a common operational picture of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities.  These capabilities will enable commanders, leaders, soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess training requirements so they can more effectively plan, prepare, execute, and assess training. End result is an ATIS that enables soldiers to train as they fight so they can effectively fight as they have trained. \n\nThe Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&E will be applied. One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System\/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS\/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request\/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).\n\n HRC Core IT: Award date shown reflects iPERMS IT Integration Contract.

An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System - Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps.

Section 2371b, titled \"Authority of the Department of Defense to Carry out Certain Prototype Projects\" and offer a streamlined method for selecting and conducting prototype projects. The ALD program office is taking advantage of this useful acquisition tool to procure ALD prototypes rapidly.  Section 2371b requires that competitive procedures be used \"to the maximum extent practicable,\" and the ALD is using a \"full and open\" Prototype Proposal Opportunity Notice (PPON) to achieve maximum competition.\n\nIn addition to the system functional requirements, a directed needs statement directs the program to:\n- Procure no less than two, and not more than four, prototypes for user assessment, development of application protocol interfaces, and development of selected software interfaces with designated Authoritative Data Sources.\n- Phase the program to deliver an initial capability of two to four prototypes no later than 30 days (from award announcement) that allows assessment of the awarded two to four prototypes and a final comparison tradeoff. The results will lead to a follow-on award of one to two prototypes for an additional assessment phase upon execution of a Decision Point.\n\nIn actuality, ALD selected five vendors to compete in Phase 1 of the prototype development (August 2019 through December 2019) which resulted in two vendors moving onto Phase 2 of the prototype development.  The ALD program office is currently conducting\/completing Phase 2 with one vendor (down-selected to one on 26 June 2019).  Production will be acquired separately, as a sole-sourced contract, leveraging the research and information captured during the two prototyping phases."

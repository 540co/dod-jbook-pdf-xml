To improve readiness for a more lethal force, AFWS provides timely, accurate, resilient and relevant environmental information, to include space and terrestrial weather, for global battlespace situational awareness for Air Force (AF), Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), combatant commands, and other government agencies.  AFWS capabilities at home station and deployed provide critical support to the full spectrum of air and space combat operations.  AFWS development enhances the lethality, effectiveness, and survivability of AF weapon systems and precision munitions by modernizing capability and seeking the military advantage to accurately predict friendly and foe environmental impacts to optimize mission execution and planning, targeting, weaponeering, battle damage assessment and space systems operations.  To strengthen alliances and partnerships, AFWS development efforts integrate DoD, government agency, and commercial and international partner environmental data with AFWS information system equipment for processing, storing, exploiting and disseminating multi-domain weather information for analysis, forecasting, mission integration and greater interoperability.  Funding for AFWS development also ensures greater performance and affordability through improvements to architecture and system efficiency, cybersecurity, C4ISR integration, migration to cloud computing, and expanding agile software development, delivery and integration practices.  \n\nAFWS aligns activities under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring\/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions. Of these four capability areas, two (Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination and Weather Forecasting) are addressed by APPN 3600, BA 07, PE 0305111F, Project 672738 - Weather Service. \n \n1. Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides command and control and mission planning integration; centralized, cybersecure weather web service capability; large-scale data ingest, processing, and warfighter product generation and visualization;  Continuous Delivery\/Continuous Integration for software development and deployment; global, regional, and mission execution forecasts; specific, mission-tailored weather data on demand; and weapon system interoperability which shortens the Combatant Commander kill chain through machine to machine interfaces.  The Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination capability area includes activities for Weather Data Analysis and its follow-on increment, Weather Data Analysis Increment 5 (WDA and WDA-Inc 5). \n\n2. Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission planning, rehearsal, and execution with an emphasis on clouds, theater scale weather, aerosol\/chemical constituents, and space environment characterization. Weather Forecasting includes activities for Numerical Weather Modeling (NWM); Weather Services - Live, Virtual, Constructive (WS-LVC), and Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS). \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Weather Services capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F, 0605833F, 1206392F, and 1206398F.\n\nActivities include research and analysis to support current program planning. Management Service costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) and Advisory and Assistance Service (A&AS).\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

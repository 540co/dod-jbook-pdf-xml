            "val": "The Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&T) program is the joint, defense-wide component of the DoD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program directed in Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2521, the latter of which represents the Department\u2019s comprehensive advanced manufacturing program focused on enabling the strategic goals of timely, affordable delivery of dominant technologies to the warfighter, and improving the acquisition and sustainment of defense products and systems across their life cycles.  Designing for manufacturability early in the development of defense-essential products and systems can yield dramatic and positive impacts for the Department\u2019s operational and modernization missions. \n\t\t\t\nThe DMS&T component of the DoD ManTech program specifically focuses on the development of cross-cutting and potentially game-changing manufacturing technologies, processes and capabilities that are typically beyond the scope or risk of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform.These high-leverage, defense-wide investments are designed to benefit the performance, affordability, and delivery timelines\/deployment cycles of many of the department\u2019s most essential products and systems in ways that are not typically achievable through the efforts of a single service, agency or program office.\n\t\t\t\nThe DMS&T program, therefore, is a unique and fundamental DoD ManTech Program component that is needed to optimize a coordinated manufacturing technology development process across the department broadly.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes and capabilities along with S&T development enables the timely, affordable adoption and deployment of emerging technologies needed to maintain U.S. warfighting dominance.  Key DMS&T technical areas for investment include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing, and respective technology focus areas addressed by each of the DoD-led manufacturing innovation institutes (discussed in the next paragraph).  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design\/qualification\/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.\n\nManufacturing innovation institutes established by the DoD and part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program are also funded in this program element. Technical innovation and leadership in U.S. manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of industrial competitiveness to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. Eight DoD Manufacturing USA institutes have been established to serve as regional hubs accelerating technological innovation and associated production processes and educational\/workforce competencies for military and commercial applications via shared public-private sectors.  These Manufacturing USA institutes, supported by resources from multiple U.S. Government agencies, are generating significant industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and are forming new technology transition pathways via regional hubs spurring active collaboration among government, industry, and academia to help meet critical government and warfighter needs. The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President\u2019s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,\u201d published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) \u201dNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan\u201d and 3) \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,\u201d both published in February 2016."

Investments in both cases are built and managed in collaboration with the Department\u2019s research, development and acquisition (RDA) communities (including active, ongoing coordination with the DoD ManTech Program\u2019s Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel) and industry and target the development of defense-essential advanced manufacturing processes and associated workforce capabilities.  The portfolio includes a focus on above-the-shop-floor new manufacturing processes and practices having the potential to improve manufacturing efficiencies at broader, enterprise levels. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to more surgically apply investments to compelling and sometimes urgent manufacturing needs.\n \t\t\t\nData calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements, and then down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through funding opportunity announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including \"above the shop floor\" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP,and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level."

Focal points are productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base to accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs. Future efforts will focus on advances in fuel cells, lasers, enhanced acuity microdisplays, and transparent ceramics for opto-mechanical and armor applications.\n\nThe Transparent Ceramic Initiative will address DoD applications for electro-optics, including fibers, films, and bulk solid state components, such as windows. Typical materials include: sapphire, ALON, and spinel. Transparent ceramics offer the potential for improved ballistic strength for battlefield armor and personnel protection. Investments include but are not limited to: high strength spinel scale-up, Nanocomposite Optical Ceramics (NCOC) powder scale-up, infrared windows, and curved transparent ceramics. \n\nProjects:\n\nMini Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) Cameras and Imagers (FY 2016): Expedite the transition of 10 um (TEC)-less SWIR cameras to the warfighter and develop wafer level processing techniques to improve yield and reduce contaminants in the SWIR focal plane array (FPA)\/ camera assembly. Will establish the industrial base for SWIR technology systems and components. Reduced unit cost allows more individuals to carry imagers; 6x improved cost, reduced from $30K to $5K; 3x reduced size from 3cm3 to 1cm3; 3x reduced weight from 120 g to 40 g. Applications include COSI, INOD, COS3, AWST, Joint Effect Targeting System (JETS), IDNST, PAWS, and MTS-B.\n\nMini Vis - SWIR Cameras and Imagers (FY 2016): Develop a manufacturing capability to produce one camera that can see the entire spectral band of Visible, Near Infrared (NIR), and Short-wave Infrared (SWIR); while being compatible with visible, NIR, and SWIR laser pointers and illuminators. Applications include: COSI, INOD, COS3, Advanced Weapon Sight Technology (AWST), Joint Effect Targeting System (JETS), Integrated Day\/Night Sight Technology (IDNST), PAWS, and Multispectral Targeting System (MTS-B).\n\nManufacturability of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) \u2013 Phase II (FY 2016-2018): Develop the capability to produce a Multi-Function Laser Illuminator and Pointer that delivers the functionality of five different devices (Green, NIR, and Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) Laser Pointers plus NIR and SWIR illuminators) in a single, high-power, lightweight unit, which would give the warfighter commonality with all other weapon systems and be covert.

Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  Projects selected will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations while reducing cost, acquisition time, and risk of major defense acquisition programs.\n\nIt is paramount for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access computer-aided design (CAD) for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.\n\nEmerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  a large-scale challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between the Government and contractors.\n\nProjects:\nMTConnect Challenge Phase II (FY 2016): Promote academia\u2019s educational development and implementation of production interactive solutions to the broad U.S industrial base with the expansion of MTConnect Challenge that contributes to reduced cycle times and the development of real-time production metrics for adaptable dashboard applications.\n\nSecuring American Manufacturing (SAM) (FY 2016): develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities. Applications span the US Defense Industrial Base.\nCyber Security for the Shop Floor - Phase II (FY 2017-2018): The manufacturing factory floor is a growing area of concern for DoD cyber security because defense contractors throughout the DoD's supply chain are continually targeted by cyber criminals seeking to: 1) steal technical data, including critical national security information and valuable commercial intellectual property; 2) alter data, thereby affecting processes and products; and 3) impair or deny process control, thereby damaging or shutting down operations. Protecting the operational systems of a manufacturing enterprise presents a different set of challenges from protecting enterprise IT systems and networks.  This phase II project will develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities. Applications span the US Defense Industrial Base."

                            "val": "Technological innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic competitiveness to maintain technological advantage and global dominance for our military. To support these goals, Manufacturing USA institutes, each led by non-profit 501(c) entities, have been established by the Department to serve as national assests with headquarters and regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial applications and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DOE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of these Manufacturing USA institutes  will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs.  The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President\u2019s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,\u201d published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) \u201dNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan\u201d and 3) \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,\u201d both published in February 2016.\n\nEach of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes addressed in this budget is expected to be self-sustaining, without reliance on federal sustainment funding, by the end of the period defined by the respective cooperative agreement (CA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) between the federal government and the non-profit organization leading each institute consortium of members.  This CA\/TIA period is typically for five years, with the flexibility to extend the agreement up to two years for the benefit of DoD projects, technical achievement, etc., and to fully leverage the minimum 1:1 cost share.  \n\nEach of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes is intended to: \n1) Bring together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state and local governments and organizations to create regionally-based but nationally-impactful public-private partnerships underpinning the formation of sustainable manufacturing innovation ecosystems\n2) Accelerate innovation to bridge the gap between Research and Development (R&D) and deployment of technological innovations in domestic production of goods\n3) Invest in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, accelerating innovation within DoD and across all manufacturing sectors to increase U.S. competitiveness\n4) Provide shared assets to help companies access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment \n5) Create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills\n6) Focus on maturing the associated manufacturing technologies typically from from Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 4 through 7\n\nThe first and second year of each of these new institutes is devoted to establishing a sustainable business model and operations, with continued refinement throughout the full period of the cooperative agreement, including: expanding the institute\u2019s membership base (as appropriate); establishing and solidifying revenue streams (e.g., funding from new R&D activity, membership fees, training and workforce development, certification and licensing, etc.); establishing provisional Executive Council and Technical Advisory committees to execute the business of each institute; finalizing Intellectual Property plans; developing technology roadmaps to inform investment strategies; opening industrial commons to provide for shared resource facilities available to all institute members; initiating workforce training programs in each technology area; establishing complementary relationships between Manufacturing USA institutes; analyzing the U.S. and Global industrial base in partnership with other government agencies to build upon the institute portfolio and address critical requirements; and further developing national technology roadmaps."

The motivation is to increase U.S. competitiveness in advanced tissue biofabrication manufacturing by encouraging insertion of disruptive technologies into multiple biotechnology sectors, streamlining integrated testing technologies and ultimately reducing the barrier to entry for new inventors. The goal is to establish a collaboration that will mature tissue-related technology across a range of manufacturing readiness levels (MRL) 4-7, enabling post-delivery assurance of tissue identity, viability, function, and efficacy. This Institute will bring together the diverse and currently fragmented collection of industry practices and institutional knowledge across many disciplines (cell biology, bioengineering, materials science, analytical chemistry, robotics, and quality assurance). Scaling up to commercial level production of tissues will require manufacturing and process automation suitable for living cells, as well as testing and preservation methods appropriate for tissue-based products with limited shelf-life and a narrow window of efficacy. \n\nTechnical focus at a minimum will be comprised of four thrust areas: 1) Cell & Material Selection & Sourcing;  2) Biofabrication Platforms;  3) Process Design and Automation;  4) Tissue Finishing and Testing Technologies\nThis institute was established in late 2016.

The executing military department or agency, in close coordination with OSD, uses a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selects a winning consortium.  The final terms of the cooperative agreement\/technology investment agreement between the selectee and the federal government are then negotiated and the CA or TIA is signed.

Notwithstanding this complexity, the Department is careful to maintain orientation with the DoD ManTech program\u2019s statutory goals and objectives and has concluded that those requirements are highly complementary to, and supportive of, the broader national goals of the Manufacturing USA Program as laid out in the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act of 2014.  Performance relative to both sets of goals\/objectives is necessarily measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and many of the institutes accomplishments previously addressed represent rich and highly descriptive qualitative and quantitative measure of program performance.  The Department actively reviews or oversees the review of institute metrics at four levels: 1) the overall Manufacturing USA network level (this is done in coordination with the DoD\u2019s Manufacturing USA interagency partners), 2)  at the DoD\/funding agency level (per the statutory requirements of DoD ManTech Program), 3) at the individual institute level (in coordination with each institute), and 4) at the specific technology project level (via DoD technical expert involvement in the institutes). Broadly, the institutes themselves are charged by the DoD, the Administration and Congress with ensuring that key elements of their innovation ecosystems will be matured and made widely available by fostering collaborations between appropriate elements of that ecosystem. The following four categories of metrics have emerged as common focus areas:\n1.\tImpact on U.S. Innovation Ecosystem\n2.\tFinancial Leverage\/Sustainability\n3.\tEducation and Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development \n4.\tTechnical Advancement\nSpecific metrics and the annual cycle for measuring progress against benchmarks are developed for each institute consortium and reflect that institute\u2019s unique technology capability, expertise, and organizational structure. The Department strives to ensure that the assessment process captures and articulates the benefits to national security based upon technological advancements and the industrial base."

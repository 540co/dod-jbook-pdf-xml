LRSO will replace the currently fielded Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) and will be integrated on both legacy and future bomber aircraft.   The LRSO weapon system will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) from significant stand-off range to prosecute strategic targets in support of the Air Force's global attack capability and strategic deterrence core function.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging or short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver LRSO capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nThis program is conducting activities associated with engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements during the technology maturation and risk reduction phase.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

The selected prime contractors will execute cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts during TMRR with activities focused on developing and maturing subsystem and system designs culminating in a final TMRR design review, delivery of Controlled Test Vehicles and conducting a vehicle configuration audit.  A follow-on source selection for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Production phases will be conducted near the end of TMRR to select a single prime contractor to execute the EMD and Production phases of the program."

            "val": "Global Theater Security Cooperation Management information System (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nation\u2019s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events. G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs). It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states. The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time. The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF).\n\nG-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability. The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states. G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines\/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc. This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities. To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding.\n\nG-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Info System (OHASIS), and Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems. G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology. Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in four major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY2012-FY2020."

New requirements resulted from the Joint Staff J6 Requirements Workshop in Jun 2015 which added additional developmental efforts to the fourth release.  New capabilities will include the ability for conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD, CJCS and MILDEP stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD CAC\/PKI Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DOD agencies such as the Deptartment of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user\u2019s organization is easily shared and accessible.  Further improvements will be accomplished on the Cross-Domain Solution (CDS), which will allow the transfer of data\/documents from SIPRNet to NIPRNet; the addition of four Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) which are a major component of G-TSCMIS data and reduce user re-entry resulting in a positive operational impact and higher quality of data -- i.e. completeness and accuracy; expansion of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which will facilitate dynamic creation and maintenance of access control policies, subject attributes, and resource attributes.\n\nFY18 controls also required for program support for the acquisition, system development test and evaluation, systems engineering, cybersecurity, training development, and cross domain solution implementation fees.  If full FY18 funds are not received, the scope of the Release 4 development contract would be reduced and the acquisition effort would be required beyond FY20.  By not delivering all key capabilities in this final release, severe impacts on the security cooperation user community would occur as the demand signal to use G-TSCMIS increases"

User stories and scenarios will be developed to support testing.  Design reviews and planning efforts of new capabilities will be very technical and required full understanding of requirements.  New capabilities will include the ability for conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD, CJCS and MILDEP stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD CAC\/PKI Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DOD agencies such as the Dept. of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user\u2019s organization is easily shared and accessible.  Further improvements will be accomplished on the Cross-Domain Solution (CDS), which will allow the transfer of data\/documents from SIPRNet to NIPRNet; the addition of four Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) which are a major component of G-TSCMIS data and reduce user re-entry resulting in a positive operational impact and higher quality of data -- i.e. completeness and accuracy; expansion of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which will facilitate dynamic creation and maintenance of access control policies, subject attributes, and resource attributes."

Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G- TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2020. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2, and fair and open competition for the Release 3 contract. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards. Release 4 will be completed by a separate contract which will be competed for under fair and open competition."

Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program. The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational. Additional statistics-based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&V and Developmental tests validate system performance.

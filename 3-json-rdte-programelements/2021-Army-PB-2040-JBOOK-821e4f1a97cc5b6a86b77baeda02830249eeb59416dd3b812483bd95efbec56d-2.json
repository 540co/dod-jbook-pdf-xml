Army MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high-priority, transformational topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline (e.g., Intelligent Luminescence for Communication, Display, and Identification). For many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application.  The DURIP provides funds to acquire major research equipment to augment current, or devise new, research capabilities in support of Army transformational research. The PECASE program funds single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.  \n\nWork in this PE provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The MURI program funds university based basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining land combat technology superiority. Army MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high- priority, transformational topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline (e.g. Intelligent Luminescence for Communication, Display, and Identification). For many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application.  The DURIP provides funds to acquire major research equipment to augment current, or devise new, research capabilities in support of Army transformational research. The PECASE program funds single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.\n\nWork in this Project provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

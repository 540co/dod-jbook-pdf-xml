Integration with additional sensors will be obtained through network communications and software in line with Net-Ready requirements. TSS will address four of the five base camp core protection\/security capabilities identified in the Integrated Base Defense (IBD) Concept of Operations (CONOPS) which are perimeter security, entry control, persistent surveillance, warning and alerting.

In FY2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) will provide funding to support pre-milestone B activities and risk reduction activities.\n\nTSS received Materiel Development Decision (MDD) approval on 6 January 2017.  The acquisition concept and contracting strategy for TSS is pending approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) with plans to leverage the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide programmatic and developmental support and existing RDT&E contracts for the system design, development, and integration of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) systems and to support Operational Assessments (OA). Key efforts include system design and engineering efforts, development of two engineering development models (EDMs), testing and evaluation for TSS Key Performance Parameters (KPPs)\/Key System Attributes (KSAs)\/Additional Performance Parameters (APAs), and Developmental and Operational Test and Evaluation.\n\nMilestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E), Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C), and TSS in order to gain programmatic efficiencies."

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) researches, designs, and evaluates combat and tactical vehicle automotive technologies that enable the Army to have a lighter, more survivable, more mobile and more deployable force. Project C05 investigates, researches, and evaluates advanced ground vehicle design and occupant protection technologies in such areas as armor concepts, ballistic defeat mechanisms, blast mitigation, survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), hit avoidance, kill avoidance, safety, sensors, counter-measures, instrumentation and survivability packaging concepts to achieve superior survivability\/protection for Soldiers and military ground vehicles. Survivability technologies will be designed for integration into the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS). Project H77 funds the National Automotive Center (NAC), which was chartered by the Secretary of the Army to conduct shared government and industry, or \"dual use\", technology programs to leverage commercial investments in automotive technology research and development for Army ground combat and tactical vehicle applications. Project H91 designs, matures, and evaluates a variety of innovative and enabling technologies in the areas of electrical power, thermal management, propulsion, mobility, power for advanced survivability, vehicle diagnostics, fuels, lubricants, water purification, intelligent systems, autonomy-enabled systems, and other component technologies to enhance the mobility, power and energy and reduce the logistic chain of combat and tactical vehicles. This PE executes the Army's Combat Vehicle Prototyping (CVP) program to mature, integrate and demonstrate ground vehicle leap ahead technologies in support of future combat vehicles.\n\nWork in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with, PEs 0602105A (Materials Technology), 0602618A (Ballistics Technology, Robotics Technology), 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology), 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), 0603125A (Combating Terrorism \u2013 Technology Development), 0603734 (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), and 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).  \n\nWork in this PE is coordinated with the United States Marine Corps, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, and other ground vehicle developers within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Departments of Energy, Commerce, and Transportation.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI."

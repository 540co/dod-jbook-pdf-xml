The office collaborates with government labs, academia, and industry to execute projects that target specific mission capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Joint Staff, and senior leadership in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nService Requirements Review Board (SRRB) efficiencies are included."

            "val": "The ECTD funding supports projects that reduce technology risk of emerging capabilities by advancing conceptual and operational prototypes in support of near- and mid-term operational engagements and stability operations.  With an emphasis on interagency and joint partnerships, ECTD matures capability options to anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span one to three years through efforts that emphasize affordability, typically at a cost of less than $6.000 million.  The ECTD program focuses on rapid prototyping of emerging technologies to accelerate capabilities to the joint warfighter, including electromagnetic spectrum-agile capabilities; multi-domain, autonomous systems; counter-weapons of mass destruction capabilities; and, dismounted soldier systems.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Chairman\u2019s Gap Assessment, USD(R&E) strategic guidance, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).\n\nIn anticipation of a heightened emphasis by the new USD(R&E) on outpacing threats and seizing technical opportunities, ECTD is structured to mature emerging technologies and highlight their military capabilities through joint demonstrations and ECTD sponsored venues for defense-wide experiments and demonstrations.  These include Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance venue; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  Together, these events enable newly-developed capabilities to be showcased in realistic environments with operational user involvement.  The ECTD program supports red teaming efforts to identify vulnerabilities in emerging technologies early, ensuring follow-on systems are resilient to adversaries.\n\nIn response to changing Department of Defense priorities, two new project lines are being added to the ECTD PE.  The high energy laser (HEL) project will begin development work to integrate a HEL onboard an AC130 aircraft.  This will enhance special operations forces\u2019 ability to provide precision fires.  The red teaming project line will assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies.  This will enable the new Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering to make informed decisions on building new capabilities."

Operational users leverage Thunderstorm to experiment with mature and emerging commercial technologies that may meet mission-critical gaps.  In addition, Thunderstorm provides an opportunity for small businesses and non-traditional technology developers to demonstrate capabilities in operationally relevant scenarios while interacting with operational commands and other government personnel.  Thunderstorm demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, post-demonstration assessments, and data evaluations serve to identify new capabilities and new ways to employ existing capabilities.  Thunderstorm annually features approximately 55 technologies resulting in about $3.000 million in cost avoidance.  In FY 2017, Thunderstorm demonstrations and experimentation focused on port security, dense urban and subterranean warfare, and maritime-to-shore access control; and, demonstrated 42 technologies to representatives from 30 Department of Defense and interagency organizations."

The Stiletto program also includes other maritime platforms to assist in the exploration, assessment, and development of prototypes.  \n\nStiletto supports the rapid discovery and transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations, thereby increasing the speed of response to emerging threats.  The boat supports special operations forces, expeditionary forces, and interagency users by experimenting with new technologies and exploring their military utility to reduce the risk of emerging technologies and concepts of operation.  The Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program offers a streamlined experimentation and demonstration process that encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment, and to rapidly adapt new technologies to meet operational needs.  Stiletto annually demonstrates approximately 65 technologies resulting in about $4.000 million in cost avoidance.  In FY 2017, Stiletto conducted 14 demonstration and experimentation events focused on maritime electro-optical and infrared surveillance; counter unmanned underwater vehicles (C-UUV); and, maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance from unmanned aerial vehicles.  These events demonstrated 78 emerging technologies to 21 Department of Defense and interagency organizations.  The Stiletto vessel is home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia."

Further project details are classified.\n\u2022  Multi-Thread Experiment (MTX):  Enabled concept experimentation with autonomous unmanned vehicles (UxVs) in an operationally-relevant, multi-domain environment.  Efforts focused on collaboration via a distributed control network, which parses sensing, control, navigation, and communication information through a network to achieve mission objectives.\n\u2022  Robust Airworthy Optical Systems:  This project integrated government-developed optical subsystems to inform design of a sub-scale operationally representative solid state laser (SSL) weapon system.  Related efforts will validate and test design performance in a simulated airborne flight environment.\n\u2022  Low-Cost Precision Intercept:  This project developed and demonstrated an ultra-low size, weight, power, and cost terminal guidance seeker.  The seeker was paired with a small unmanned aerial system to demonstrate a low-cost, long-range, terminally guided platform.

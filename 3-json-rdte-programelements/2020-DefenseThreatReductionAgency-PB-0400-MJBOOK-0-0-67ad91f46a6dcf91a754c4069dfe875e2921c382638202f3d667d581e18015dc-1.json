                "val": "The increase in FY 2020 supports investment in applied research looking for disruptive technologies that will provide a greater than 70% solution to the following investment areas: Stand-Off Detection, Anti-Armor IED (AAIED), System Attributes across the Portfolio (Machine Learning, & Artificial Intelligence), as well as increased investment in future-threat forecasting and innovative analytical research studies leveraging expertise from academia and research institutions in government and industry. These areas of investment continue to be identified time and again as challenging problem sets for the warfighters as identified by the CCMDs and warfighting commands in the CCMD integrated priority lists and JUONs. This is all in support of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering ASD(R&E) guidance and congressional testimony to provide the technological foundation that ensures the U.S. military of both today and tomorrow is the most capable in the fight against IEDs and emerging improvised threats. These resources will be applied to the following: designing and fabricating ultra-light weight auxetic structures that significantly reduce damage to vehicles through reducing deflection upon impact from mine blast; developing the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and unmanned aerial vehicle cameras needed to create a 3D map of an environment; developing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methodologies to enable human understanding of Machine Learning decisions; developing fusion strategies to improve Machine Learning algorithms by including human-in-the- loop knowledge into its learning strategies; developing methods to optimize algorithms through artificial intelligence and machine learning; and forecasting future threat scenarios and threat network resiliency."

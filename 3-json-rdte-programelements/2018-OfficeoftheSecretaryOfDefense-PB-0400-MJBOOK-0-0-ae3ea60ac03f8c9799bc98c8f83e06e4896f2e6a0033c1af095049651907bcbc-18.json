            "val": "To counter the United States\u2019 historic technological advantage, adversaries are increasingly developing asymmetric capabilities that are enabled by advanced commercial electronic components and devices that have become globally available. These threats range from terrorist-employed improvised devices, unmanned air systems and easily transportable man portable air defense systems to dedicated military systems that can diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states. They include cruise and ballistic missiles, integrated air defense systems (IADS) and the advanced sensor systems used by them to detect and target U.S. forces, and advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems used to deny or negate our sensors, communications and precision navigation and targeting capabilities.\n\nThe rate at which new threats are appearing continues to accelerate and new threats are emerging faster than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) research, development and acquisition processes can respond. The plethora of new electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats is making operations in the EMS significantly more complex. The challenges posed by new kinetic and non-kinetic threats and the dire consequences of  technology surprise emphasize the need to rapidly develop and field innovative EW and EW-Cyber capabilities that can address new threats in fiscally and temporally responsible ways.\n\nThe Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) Program addresses these challenges through efforts designed to accelerate the pace of EW and EW-Cyber capabilities development by exploring technologies and using approaches that fall outside the scope or purview of the Services\u2019 research and development (R&D) programs. Enabling the rapid transition of significant technologies to Service Programs of Record (PoR) at lower cost with lower risk is essential. JEAT thus explores and assesses technological approaches that integrate and demonstrate both new and off-the-shelf military and commercial technologies in innovative ways. \n\nJEAT efforts are focused in four areas under two Project Codes, P619 (Joint Electronic Advanced Technology) and P245 (EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation). (1) Experimentation\/Demonstration (P619) utilizes innovative field and laboratory experimentation venues to understand current and future threats and explore potential countermeasures and overmatch opportunities. (2) Advanced Technology Development\/Verification (P619) explores technologies and approaches to counter advanced threats in innovative ways. (3) EW Collaboration & Planning (P619) ensures appropriate technological oversight of Departmental and Service EW and EW-Cyber R&D programs and processes and provides necessary governance insights for senior decision makers. (4) EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation (P245) accelerates the fielding of essential EW capabilities such as innovative countermeasures to new classes of advanced threats (including anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threats), and exploring and developing a variety of non-kinetic technologies, tools, and approaches to counter advanced threats and enhancing operators\u2019 and analysts\u2019 comprehension of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) environment to enable real-time precision employment of non-kinetic capabilities."

JEAT\u2019s three efforts, Experimentation\/Demonstration (Expt\/Demo), Advanced Technology Development\/Verification (ATD\/V), and EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&P), focus on enabling nearer-term technology transitions to the Services\u2019 Programs of Record (PoR) with reduced risk and cost. Expt\/Demo efforts focus on exploring, demonstrating, and assessing innovative technologies and approaches to overcome existing and developing threats and provide new overmatch capabilities for the U.S. military. ATD\/V efforts integrate advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in ways not being explored by the Services to demonstrate nearer-term technological opportunities. EW C&P efforts within Electronic Warfare and Countermeasures Office (EWCO) of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering assess, ensure coordination and provide senior leadership insights on all Departmental EW and EW-Cyber research and development (R&D) as well as coordinating national and international EW and EW-Cyber efforts. \n\nExperimentation\/Demonstration (Expt\/Demo):\n\nExpt\/Demo explores and demonstrates new EW and EW-Cyber technologies and approaches through the use of large-scale, dynamic field experimentation venues. The current venue, Vigilant Hammer (VH), is a multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive event focused on advancing the state of the art for detecting, classifying, geolocating, and engaging of electromagnetic signals of interest. Modeled after JEAT\u2019s highly successful BLACK DART, TRIDENT SPECTRE, and Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE) venues, VH includes both scripted and dynamic scenarios to give participants an opportunity to explore the efficacy of existing and new capabilities and approaches to engage emerging electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats. Follow-on venues will address concerns such as multi-platform\/multi-aperture, collaborative\/coherent EW and attacking multistatic passive\/active sensing architectures.\n\nAdvanced Technology Development\/Verification (ATD\/V):\n\nATD\/V explores, matures and assesses emerging technologies and approaches to address compelling EW and EW-Cyber warfighting needs. JEAT\u2019s ongoing ATD\/V effort, the Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) Laboratory, explores, matures and assesses emerging EW and EW-Cyber technologies to enable, for example, multi-aperture collaborative\/coherent EW and EW-Cyber employment through exquisite coordination of sensing and electronic attack capabilities. \n\nEW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&P):\n\nEW C&P supports all activities of the Director, EWCO, related to the selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of all EW- and EW-Cyber-related efforts across DoD. EW C&P oversees and ensures coordination and collaboration between OSD and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, and the Services on all EW and EW-Cyber activities within DoD. To do this, EW C&P identifies, assesses, and develops recommendations to address EW- and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensor, seeker, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures and battle management technologies. EW C&P also provides programmatic recommendations and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)) on PoR, including technology maturity and availability, Critical Program Information standards, Foreign Disclosure, and Technical Signals Requirements. EW C&P also conducts and leads analyses of advanced threats and technological opportunities to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&D research, development and acquisition efforts."

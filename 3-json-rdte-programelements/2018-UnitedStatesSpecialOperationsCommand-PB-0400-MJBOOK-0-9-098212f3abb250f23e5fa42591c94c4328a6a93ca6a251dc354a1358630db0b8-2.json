Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC) provides for efforts to develop and integrate Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) payloads to advance ISR capabilities to address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery\/signals intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies. SAFC applies focused Research & Development (R&D) for relatively low cost solutions to provide short lead-time contingency planning requirements where focused R&D will allow for test and evaluation of leading edge solutions to emergent problem sets."

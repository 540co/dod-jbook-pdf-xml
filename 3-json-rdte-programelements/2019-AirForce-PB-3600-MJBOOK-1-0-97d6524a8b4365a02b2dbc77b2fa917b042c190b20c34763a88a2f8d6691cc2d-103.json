                            "val": "This program provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of aerospace issues and concerns. The Project AIR FORCE (PAF) research agenda is focused primarily on mid to long-term problems; in addition, PAF provides quick response assistance for senior Air Force officials on high priority, near term issues. Within these areas, PAF addresses difficult and complex, far-reaching and inter-related questions linked to future strategies, approaches and policies, in order to enhance Air Force senior leadership's deliberations and decisionmaking on major issues. The Air Force Steering Group, chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff, reviews, monitors, and approves PAF annual research efforts. Each project is initiated, processed, and approved in accordance with PAF Sponsoring Agreement which requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  \n\nPAF is organized in four primary research program areas: strategy and doctrine; force modernization employment; manpower, personnel and training; and resource management. Integrative research projects are also conducted at the division level with direct support provided through the most applicable program. Research programs address organizational crosscutting issues as defined by specific research themes approved by the Air Force Steering Group. These research themes encompass a wide spectrum of topics including external challenges to national security; terrorism and homeland defense; joint and coalition operations; integrated roadmap for ISR capabilities; enhancing, tailoring and reducing infrastructure to meet new force requirements; potential changes to the Active\/Reserve\/National Guard\/Civilian\/Contractor manpower mix; and improved weapon system costing.    \n\nThe research program will continue to build upon research foundations, examining the evolving security environment, emerging threats, national and military strategy, transformation approaches including investment strategies to provide capabilities within changing Defense budgets, operational concepts to meet evolving and increasingly joint missions, exploiting advanced technologies, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of combat support, and developing the total force (Active\/Reserve\/National Guard\/Civilian\/Contractor).  These efforts will continue to inform and support the senior Air Force leadership regarding personnel management and training; improving logistical efficiencies and force sustainment; ongoing conflicts and joint operations; force structure capabilities, limitations, and operational concepts; and making force structure tradeoffs within resource constraints to meet future national security and Air Force needs.  \n\nFuture research will build upon earlier work to continue to help the Air Force to rapidly and appropriately adapt to the changing world environment and emerging threats; continue to modernize and employ its force structure to provide capabilities within changing DoD budgets; assess lessons learned from recent and ongoing conflicts; develop and utilize its total force; and enhance the support of our aerospace forces, ranging from sustainment of the force structure to agile combat support.  \n\nPAF research spans functional and organizational boundaries and is managed in a manner to facilitate independence and freedom from organizational bias thereby providing perspectives and insights to senior Air Force leaders free from parochial influences not necessarily in the best interest of the Air Force at large. Benefits of independent non-Department of Defense analysis of complex present day and emerging issues are shared beyond the immediacy of the Air Force.  PAF study results are given wide dissemination within the DOD on a routine basis and are deposited with the Defense Technical Information Center available to a broad range of qualified government and commercial-sector individuals and activities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

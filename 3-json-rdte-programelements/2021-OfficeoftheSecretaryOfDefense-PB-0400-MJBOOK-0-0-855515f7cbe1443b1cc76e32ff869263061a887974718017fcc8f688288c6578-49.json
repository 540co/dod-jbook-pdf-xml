            "val": "The DIU mission is to accelerate innovation in the commercially-focused technology sector to the warfighter.  The 2018 National Defense Strategy asserts that we have returned to an era of inter-state strategic competition with Russia and China, heightening the sense of urgency with which the nation, and Department of Defense (DoD) in particular, must reform our acquisition policies and approach to sustaining military-technical superiority. Adversaries are challenging the U.S. across several dimensions.  Most importantly, adversaries are at par or ahead of the U.S. in critical technology areas.  Consistent with the FY 2020 Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\/Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) research and development budget priorities, this new era of competition requires technological superiority to ensure ability to project power, maintain international norms and rule of law, and to serve as a credible deterrence.  Notably, the critical technologies that forge military-technical superiority are increasingly dual-use and rapidly developed by the commercial sector.\n\nThe U.S. DoD relies on innovation to maintain our nation's ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict. DIU increases the Department's access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter. Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIU is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include \"non-traditional\" companies that had previously not collaborated with the military, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their knowledge and expertise in support of our nation's defense.\n\nThe DIU Prototyping program will find and provide access to technology companies on behalf of DoD organizations.  Additionally, DIU will execute projects to leverage commercial sector technology analogous to military application thereby increasing dual-use technology agility for the DoD.  DIU Prototyping funds will facilitate the award of projects that can augment commercial technologies, existing government-owned capabilities or concepts for defense application."

For Project 843, FY 2020 $17.000 million was transferred from WHS O&M 0901583D8W to RDT&E, DW PE 0604341D8Z\/843 DIU Prototyping.  Project 844 NSIC was a new program add in FY2020, but was not funded due to a Congressional mark. NSIC was to fund the commercialization and scaling dual-use, hardware-based technologies that are critical to the military. These technology areas are currently severely underserved by the private U.S. venture capital industry and often funded by strategic and persistent capital from China. NSIC would attract private capital to leverage DoD investments in select priority projects that include batteries, drones, and quantum sensors.\n\nThe overall decrease in FY 2021 of $3.732 million was a planned program change.  The DIU Prototyping focus areas will not only save funds in the future, but more importantly, grow the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) by attracting new NSIB suppliers and improve the adoption of commercial technologies for the warfighter."

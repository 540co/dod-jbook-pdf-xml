            "val": "This program focuses on four major areas. First, the space survivability and surveillance area develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Air Force systems. Second, the spacecraft payload technologies area improves satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities. Third, the spacecraft protection area develops technologies for protecting United States space assets in potential hostile settings. The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and control technologies, and their interactions. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nIn FY 2019, the entirety of PE 0602601F, Space Technology, will transfer to PE 1206601F, Space Technology, to provide increased transparency to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Congress regarding Space Science and Technology Major Force Program 12 Space investment.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

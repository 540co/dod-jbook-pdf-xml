The MNVR provides self-forming and self-healing communication networks from the brigade to the platoon level throughout the full range of military operations.\n\nThe MNVR, a modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI), supports Army Mission Command operational requirements with a multi-channel, Type 1 (supporting multiple independent levels of security), vehicular mounted radio hosting networking waveforms.  The MNVR narrows the data capability gap at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) company level and provides the capability to build a data extension to the lowest echelons, and then enables the extension of services from the Forward Operating Base (FOB) to the platform. MNVR provides a dynamic, scalable, On-the-Move (OTM) network architecture, connecting the Soldier to the Mission Command (MC) Network and enhances capability to exchange voice and data simultaneously and faster than current systems. The advanced network waveforms provide rapid distribution of data and imagery with increased information assurance protection and automatic routing across complex terrain.  The system operates Internet Protocol (IP) based networking waveforms offering increased data throughput through self-forming, self-healing, managed communication networks.  Its route and retransmit functionality links waveforms in different frequency bands, within the 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) range, to form one cohesive network.

The ADM designated MNVR as an ACAT 1D Special Interest Program under the continued oversight of the DAE.  The ADM also approved the award of a competitive contract, and authorized the procurement of up to 232 modified NDI radios for Test & Evaluation, Platform Integration and Certification purposes in order to inform a MS C decision. On 3 Oct 2016, Defense Acquisition Executive (ADM) published a MNVR MS C Acquisition Decision Memorandum. In Nov 2017, the DAE rescinded the Special Interest designation, as well as the ACAT ID designation. The Army will determine the ACAT designation and MDA at a later date."

The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.\n\nThe portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) Efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale."

In accordance with DoD Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the U.S. Government lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&D).  As the central NTNF R&D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions.  NTNF R&D supports advanced research in the following areas: (1) Prompt nuclear effects exploitation for attribution; (2) nuclear device characterization for forensics; (3) nuclear forensic materials exploitation for attribution.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in monitoring and verification technology, device characterization for forensics, and materials exploitation for attribution.  The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the relative impact of reduction in FY 2017."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability.  Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.  The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the relative impact of reductions in FY 2017."

MACS-A addresses the ability to enable plug-and-play technologies as a force multiplier.\n- Transitioned initial MACS-A concept to U.S. Army for further development.\n- Demonstrated a highly resilient weapon design that survived two separate shock environments at different velocities, enabling detailed prototype work on other sub-systems with a known shock environment to meet TRL 6 specifications prior to transition.  Additionally, the body of knowledge resulting from the construction of high fidelity targets (softer than cement) to meet specifications of analogous high fidelity soil-codes, penetration tools, and build properties will serve many communities of interest investigating earth penetrating weapons and ground sensor designs.\n- Continued development of access denial or denial-of-use technologies for CWMD applications.\n- Continued functional defeat system development, testing, and demonstration."

The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The Radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  The Human Survivability supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in Nuclear Surety."

The assessment modeling tools provide critical analytics for Consequence of Execution (COE) considerations during nuclear targeting and post-detonation nuclear response, supporting interagency strategic and tactical decision making. These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities\/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the transition of nuclear effects modeling applied research efforts to advanced technology development."

The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets and to (2) assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the projected completion of the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize, and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to decreased investment reflecting the transition of the previously mentioned high-priority sensor technology and supporting algorithms to the combatant commands."

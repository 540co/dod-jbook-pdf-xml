The NIE will focus on testing of Programs of Record (PoR) in support of synchronized Capability Set (CS) fielding of network and mission command systems. The JWA will focus on Force 2025 concepts; interoperability & Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs); and emerging capabilities.  Beginning in FY2019, in accordance with readiness demands and the Army's new modernization approach, the mission will shift to only support Warfighter Assessment events with focus on Joint Multination Interoperability and concept development. This change will affect associated integration and management processes by reducing the formal rigor associated with PoR testing and shifting to an experimentation model, with prototype-level designs and increased unit ownership of preparation tasks.\n\nThese funds support the following major efforts associated with an assessment:\n- Planning: coordination with multiple stakeholders on the participation and resourcing of personnel, services, equipment and prototypes, and other deliverables needed for lab based risk reduction (LBRR), capability and platform integration, training, field support and logistics, event battle rhythm\/schedule, and developing network data products. \n- Preparation: Conduct LBRR, complete integrated vehicle designs, build prototype vehicles for safety release, conduct platform installation and checkout, validate the network, and obtain Information Assurance certifications.\n- Execution: technical and logistics support during soldier-led assessments, trouble ticket management and closeout, and field support management.\n- Close-out: inventorying platforms, de-installing equipment, returning platforms to their original configurations.\n\nThese funds may also be used for procuring equipment and materials (to include prototypes, when required), event infrastructure, field services, personnel (government and contractor), and travel."

Planning and Preparation are expected to occur at Ft Bliss, TX, while, Execution and Close-out are expected to occur at various locations such as the unit?s home station or a Combined Arms Training Center. \n\nPlanning:\nThese funds support the development and implementation of horse blanket architecture, conducting design activities for integration of capability onto unit vehicles, exercise planning and coordination, to include:\nDeveloping a Validation Exercise (VALEX) plan that configures and checks out the system of systems prior to the exercise; assigning unit locations within the VALEX location; identifying and resolving security issues associated with running classified and\/or coalition network operations; validating all Information Assurance Accreditations for networked C4ISR systems, and developing of technical mission threads used to validate the capabilities.\nThese funds also support defining the network system configurations and routing schemes for each event. \n\nPreparation: \nThese funds support efforts leading up to the execution of the assessment exercise, to include LBRR, vehicle integration design and build, safety release, and conducting of VALEX. \nThe LBRR risk reduction efforts are conducted in controlled laboratory environments to identify and resolve integration, configuration and interoperability issues prior to assessments. Reports delivered by the LBRR document the results of network functional testing, routing, and thread testing.\nThese funds provide for integration efforts such as design of installation kits on tactical platforms; fabrication of specialized cables, metal plates, racks, and brackets to enable platform installation\/integration; and safety release testing.  The scope of the integration effort also includes planning for Field Service Representatives (FSRs) and other technical support personnel, coordination and movement of the Fleet vehicles, and inventory management of systems.\nFollowing completion of platform integration efforts, these funds support a structured network VALEX consisting of four subordinate efforts: Load Exercise (LOADEX), ESTABLISH, INTEGRATE, and VALIDATE. \n-LOADEX; Support unit installation of new network capabilities into existing network, to include setting Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and configure network systems changes; modify radio mission plans, system configuration files and system parameters; and perform test\/fix\/test processes at the system and component levels.\n-ESTABLISH; Verification of new hardware and software performance at the platform level. Troubleshoot issues associated with network system configurations and verify that each integrated platform can perform its mission while operating on the network.\n-INTEGRATE; Verification of networked related hardware\/software performance and networked communications at each echelon. Troubleshoot issues found with new capabilities and ensure tactical unit information exchange will enable units to support their intended missions. \n-VALIDATE; Support unit conduct of mission threads to verify the correct routing of messages and information transfer among critical nodes in the network. \n\nExecution:\nFunding supports all management and synchronization of field operations and support personnel during the events, and coordination with the supported command. It also includes monitoring of network operations in the field, trouble ticket management, continued LBRR support to troubleshoot technical issues, deployment of mobile facilities, and replacement parts\/components required to effectively support concepts and capabilities under assessment.\n\nCloseout:\nThese funds support all activities associated with the de-installation and recovery of systems, components, A-kits, cabling installed on platforms, and restoration of platforms to baseline configurations.  Removal, inspection, repair\/replacement, shipping, and storing of all materiel and infrastructure used to enable the unit to execute the event.  Conduct AARs for process improvements.\n\nFuture Planning:\nThese funds support efforts to provide technical input on candidate systems at the Concepts and Capabilities Review Board and Strategic Planning Reviews for future events."

Technologies will be demonstrated in relevant environments, performing tactical\/operational scenarios. Efforts will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability within one to five years. Efforts will include accelerated material development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs in Cyber; Electronic Warfare (EW); Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Survivability and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical Program of Record capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements, and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.\nThe Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders' needs. The Army RCO was established per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT: Establishment of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, signed by the Secretary of the Army: Eric K. Fanning, dated 11 August 2016.\nThe RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and\/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally. Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.   \n\nThe RCO capabilities focus areas are:\nCyber\nElectronic Warfare (EW)\nPosition, Navigation and Timing (PNT)\nSurvivability\nOperational Needs Statements (ONS)\nAny other operational needs that become a priority as designated by the Army Board of Directors (BOD)"

This is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) adapting COTS\/GOTS\/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and 2) developing emerging deployable capability through research and development organizations, academia, and industry. The RCO uses streamlined acquisition methods, processes and techniques to rapidly acquire capability; these methods vary by project. The Rapid Capabilities Office will have a dedicated contracting staff, with the flexibility to use both traditional and non-traditional contracting approaches. To reach non-traditional vendors, RCO will use non-standard contracting methods, such as Other Transaction Authority instruments. Where practicable, prototypes will be acquired using competitive procedures. Projects will be transitioned to an approved acquisition program for production and sustainment. Operational assessments will be conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation, prototype maturation, and future capability development."

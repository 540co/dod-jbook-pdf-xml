The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within U.S. and foreign airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system to provide a solution for improved airspace access in terminal operations as well as operations\/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at Fort Hood and Shadow operations at Cherry Point). This system provides a near-term solution and is an integral part of the long-term permanent solution. Long-term GBSAA systems and Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) architectures, operating concepts, standards and technology are being developed to allow DoD, commercial, and private manned and Group 1-5 Unmanned Aircraft to operate safely and effectively in the national airspace.  The change in airspace procedures, airspace de-confliction, and Traffic Management requires new processes and procedures for safe and secure national airspace access.  \n \nThis joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, policy, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems."

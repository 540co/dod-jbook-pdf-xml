In FY12, as an AF pilot initiative, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&M to RDT&E, AF funds. \n\nSMC is authorized to employ approximately 1,499 civilian acquisition professionals providing the management, tools, and technical capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB 61 Air Base Group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Air Force initiatives in response to the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act.  This program element supports both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

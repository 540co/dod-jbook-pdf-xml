            "val": "The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) ensures the protection of Navy and Navy hosted joint telecommunication and Information Technology (IT) systems from cyber exploitation and attack. The ISSP extends cybersecurity to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems and content processed, stored, or transmitted therein by performing the acquisition, modernization and sustainment of cybersecurity platforms and systems; cyberspace operations include both defensive and offensive measures, which preserve the ability to protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems while projecting power by the application of force in or through cyberspace. The ISSP includes the protection of the Navy's National Security Systems (NSS).  The ISSP must be rapid, predictive, adaptive, and tightly coupled to cyberspace technology. The ISSP provides cybersecurity systems and infrastructure based on mission impacts, cybersecurity threats, information criticality, vulnerabilities, and required defensive countermeasure capabilities.\n \nThe ISSP focuses on efforts that address the risk management of cyberspace, which provides capabilities to protect, detect, restore and respond.  The ISSP provides the Navy with the following cybersecurity elements: (1) defense of National Security Systems (NSS), including the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications, Navy (NC3-N) system, naval weapons systems, critical naval infrastructure for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) afloat and shore networks, joint time and navigation systems, and industrial control systems, using modern cryptographic solutions and cyber security tools; (2) technologies for the Navy's Computer Network Defense (CND) service provider that accelerates the Navy's ability to prevent, constrain, and mitigate cyber attacks and critical vulnerabilities; (3) Navy Cyber Situational Awareness (NCSA) technologies that provides the operational context for cyber threat intelligence and Situational Awareness (SA), from external boundaries to tactical edge infrastructures; (4) assurance of the Navy's Cryptography (Crypto) telecommunications infrastructure and the wireless spectrum; (5) sensing cyber threats across all Navy shore and afloat networks to expand the capabilities of monitoring, assessing, and detecting adversary activities across multiple enclaves through the collection of tools in SHARKCAGE; (6) alignment to Navy's Insider Threat program; (7) assurance of joint-user cyberspace domains, using a Defense-In-Depth (DiD) security architecture and its alignment with the Joint Information Environment (JIE)\/Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS); (8) assurance technologies, including Key Management (KM) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)."

                            "val": "The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts extend our cybersecurity and resiliency, provide Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO), and cross domain solutions to protect data, Department of Defense (DoD) Information Networks (DoDIN), net-centric operations, the forward deployed, and other designated systems in order to protect cyberspace and critical warfighting capabilities.  \n\nThis project includes a rapidly evolving development, design and application integration effort to modernize cryptographic equipment and ancillaries with state-of-the-art replacements to counter evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats.  Communications Security (COMSEC) and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) are evolving from stand-alone, dedicated devices to embedded modules incorporating National Security Agency (NSA) approved cryptographic engines, loaded with the certified algorithms and keys, and interconnected via industry-defined interfaces. This includes the DoDIN capability requirements document for the development of Content Based Encryption (CBE). \n \nComputer Network Defense (CND): The CND program provides cyberspace capabilities to secure the Cyber Domain.  CND is a combination of hardware, software, sets of processes and protective measures that use computer networks to detect, monitor, protect, analyze and defend against network infiltrations resulting in service\/network denial, degradation and disruptions. CND enables a government or military institute\/organization to defend against network attacks perpetrated by malicious or adversarial computer systems or networks.\n\nNavy Cryptography (Crypto): Navy Crypto modernizes legacy cryptographic equipment which includes families of COMSEC and TRANSEC devices that are divided into crypto voice, crypto data, crypto products and associated ancillary devices.  These devices provide modern cryptographic solutions to replace obsolete, legacy devices within the crypto categories.\n\nKey Management (KM): KM monitors and tracks capability verification testing, designs and tests capabilities to provide a net-centric web based architecture, for the ordering, management, and distribution of all cryptographic key material to support Navy users, to include integration of Intermediary Application (iApp).  \n\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI): The DoD PKI program, under the authority of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD AT&L), develops and tests PKI equipment and is responsible for meeting statutory and regulatory requirements for the DoD PKI program. The Navy PKI program tests and implements products for afloat networks and shore non-Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) networks and institutionalizes Identity and Access Management (IdAM) so that person and non-person entities can securely access all authorized DoD resources. \n\nSHARKCAGE: SHARKCAGE is a global, federated DCO enclave consisting of shore sensor nodes, DCO analysis workbenches, and analytic suites.  Utilizing one-way passive taps in a protected, isolated, classified environment, SHARKCAGE consolidates cyber event data from multiple platforms and networks, providing Navy DCO forces with a shared environment and common platform for integrated workflow, collaboration, and analysis.  SHARKCAGE efficiently detects, correlates, and analyzes nation and non-nation state attacks against maritime Navy networks and the Naval Networking Environment (NNE).\n\nNavy Cyber Situational Awareness (NCSA): NCSA is a command and control infrastructure that provides Navy commanders with timely, trusted, and comprehensive Situational Awareness (SA) of the cyberspace domain to include tailored, near real-time visualization of network health, vulnerabilities, and operational readiness through the correlation of data from multiple sources.  NCSA combines asset data, baseline configuration data, and real-time threat data which is critical for defending a fully-interconnected network infrastructure.  NCSA enables early threat detection and timely decision making.\n\nCybersecurity Services: Cybersecurity Services develop cyber architecture and provides cybersecurity engineering for the DoD and Department of the Navy (DoN) cybersecurity interests based on the requirements prioritized by Fleet Cyber Command\/Commander Tenth Fleet (FCC\/C10F).  Cybersecurity Services transitions new technologies to address current Navy cybersecurity challenges.      \n\nFY19 will focus on efforts that address the risk management of cyberspace, which provides capabilities to protect, detect, restore and respond.  The ISSP provides the Navy with the following cybersecurity elements: (1) defense of National Security Systems (NSS), including the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications, Navy (NC3-N) system, naval weapons systems, critical naval infrastructure for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) afloat and shore networks, joint time and navigation systems, and industrial control systems, using modern cryptographic solutions and cyber security tools; (2) technologies supporting the Navy's Computer Network Defense (CND) service provider that will help the Navy's ability to prevent, constrain, and mitigate cyber attacks and critical vulnerabilities; (3) Navy Cyber Situational Awareness (NCSA) technologies that provides the operational context for cyber threat intelligence and Situational Awareness (SA), from external boundaries to tactical edge infrastructures; (4) assurance of the Navy's Crypto telecommunications infrastructure and the wireless spectrum; (5) sensing cyber threats across all Navy shore and afloat networks to expand the capabilities of monitoring, assessing, and detecting adversary activities across multiple enclaves through the collection of tools in SHARKCAGE; (6) alignment to Navy's Insider Threat program; (7) assurance of joint-user cyberspace domains, using a Defense-In-Depth (DiD) security architecture and its alignment with the Joint Information Environment (JIE)\/Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS); (8) assurance technologies, including the Key Management (KM) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)."

The rapid advancement of cyber technology requires an efficient process for updating CND tools deployed to afloat and shore platforms.  Recognizing the need for future CND capability improvements, the CND program implements an evolutionary acquisition strategy that delivers CND capabilities in multiple builds and functionality releases that address validated requirements.\n\nNavy Cryptography (Crypto): Modernized crypto devices will replace legacy crypto in accordance with the mandate by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6510 as well as the National Security Agency (NSA) planned decertification, which improves the Navy's cyber defense posture. For Advanced Cryptographic Capability (ACC) the acquisition strategy will follow the NSA direction on mandated software upgrades. The planned KGV-11M program will be led by the Navy.\n\nKey Management (KM): Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) is a NSA-led ACAT I program.  It is the next generation Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) that provides the infrastructure for management, ordering and distribution of key material as well as directly supporting the key requirements of all Crypto modernization efforts.  KMI will follow an increment\/spiral development strategy.  The KMI program will continue to develop alternative architecture implementations for communities within the Navy to implement the Intermediary Application (iApp) as a KM solution.\n\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI): Department of Defense (DoD) PKI is an ACAT I program jointly led by the NSA and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD AT&L) is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The Navy PKI project supports the DoD-wide implementation of PKI products and services across Navy afloat, non-Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) networks and other excepted networks.\n\nSHARKCAGE: The SHARKCAGE Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC) effort will integrate COTS and GOTS hardware and software products to monitor multiple Navy networks and enclaves to detect, analyze, and assess threats.  SHARKCAGE will provide Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command (NCDOC), Navy Information Operations Centers (NIOC), Fleet Cyber Command\/Commander Tenth Fleet (FCC\/C10F), Cyber Protection Teams (CPT), and other CND deployers with a global Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) enclave to monitor the Naval Networking Environment (NNE) and maritime Navy networks, including Navy shore sites and afloat platforms conducting Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications, Navy (NC3-N) missions.\n\nNavy Cyber Situational Awareness (NCSA): The NCSA RDC effort will integrate COTS and GOTS hardware and software products to provide visualization of Navy networks and enclaves to analyze and assess mission threats.  NCSA will be implemented via an evolutionary acquisition approach using an iterative, agile software enhancement process in the form of capability drops to address future cyber Situation Awareness (SA) capabilities and improvements required by fleet warfighters. These government-led agile software enhancements will be documented and managed through a requirements governance board process. \n\nCybersecurity Services:  Cybersecurity Services is a Navy project, which develops cyber architecture and provides security engineering for the DoD and Department of the Navy (DoN) cybersecurity interests based on the requirements prioritized by Fleet Cyber Command\/Commander Tenth Fleet (FCC\/C10F).  Cybersecurity Services transitions new technologies to address current Navy cybersecurity challenges."

                            "val": "The goal of the Information Assurance (IA) program is to ensure the continued protection of Navy and joint information and information systems from hostile exploitation and attack. The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) activities address the triad of Defense Information Operations: protection, detection, and reaction. Evolving attack sensing (detection), warning, and response (reaction) responsibilities extend far beyond the traditional ISSP role in protection of Information Systems Security (INFOSEC). Focused on the highly mobile forward deployed subscriber, the Navy's adoption of Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) places demands upon the ISSP, as the number of users expands significantly and the criticality of their use escalates. Today, the ISSP protects an expanding core of services critical to the effective performance of the Navy's mission.\n\nThe rapid rate of change in the underlying commercial and government information infrastructures makes the provision of security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem.  IA technology mix and deployment strategies must evolve quickly to meet rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. No longer can information security be divorced from the information infrastructure. The ISSP enables the Navy's war fighter to trust in the availability, integrity, authentication, privacy, and non-repudiation of information.\n\nThis project includes funds for advanced technology development, test and evaluation of naval information systems security based on leading edge technologies that will improve information assurance (e.g., situational awareness and information infrastructure protection) across all command echelons to tactical units afloat and war fighters ashore.  This effort will provide the research to develop a secure seamless interoperable, common operational environment of networked information systems in the battle space and for monitoring and protecting the information infrastructure from malicious activities. This effort will provide naval forces a secure capability and basis in its achievement of protection from unauthorized access and misuse, and optimized IA resource allocations in the information battle space. This program will also develop core technology to: (1) improve network infrastructure resistance and resiliency to attacks; (2) enable the rapid development and certification of security-aware applications and information technologies in accordance with the common criteria for IA and IA-enabled information technology products by the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee; and (3) measure the effectiveness and efficiency of IA defensive capabilities under naval environments.\n\nThe program will develop common architectural frameworks that facilitate integration of network security capabilities, enable effective seamless interoperation, and contribute to a common consistent picture of the networked environment with respect to information assurance and security. This effort will address the need for a common operational picture for IA, as well as assessment of security technology critical to the success of the mission. This effort will also initiate requirements definition for situational awareness capabilities to support computer network defense in a highly-distributed, homogeneous, and heterogeneous networks including mobile and embedded networked devices. This effort also includes the architectural definition of situational awareness and visualization capabilities to support active computer network defense and support underlying data mining and correlation tools.  This includes addressing the capability to remotely manage and securely control the configurations of network security components to implement changes in real time or near real time. This program will also initiate requirements definition for secure coalition data exchange and interoperation among security levels and classifications, and ensure approaches address various security level technologies as well as emerging architectural methods of providing interoperability across different security levels. IA will examine multi-level aware applications and technologies including databases, web browsers, routers\/switches, etc. Efforts will also initiate infrastructure protection efforts as the Navy develops network centric architectures and warfare concepts, ensuring an evolutionary development of security architectures and products for IA that addresses Navy infrastructure requirements. IA will ensure the architectures  evolve to provide proper protection as technology, Department of Defense (DoD) missions, and threats continuously evolve. IA includes defensive protections as well as intrusion monitoring (sensors), warning mechanisms, and response capabilities in the architecture. Ensure the unique security and performance requirements of tactical systems, including those operating various security levels are addressed. Also, the program will initiate the efforts to conceptualize new network centric warfare technology to protect our assets, such as secure network gateways, routers, components and tools that improve the survivability of Navy networks. Additionally, IA will provide systems security engineering, certification and accreditation support for high-confidence naval information systems and ensure certification and accreditation approaches are consistent with Navy and DoD requirements."

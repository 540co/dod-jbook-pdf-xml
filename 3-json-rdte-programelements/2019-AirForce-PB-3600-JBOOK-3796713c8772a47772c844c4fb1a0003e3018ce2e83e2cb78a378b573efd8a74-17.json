Activities also include research and analysis to support current program planning. Management Service costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) and Advisory and Assistance Service (A&AS). AFWS provides timely, accurate, consistent and relevant space and atmospheric (a.k.a. terrestrial) weather information for global battlespace situational awareness. AFWS supports worldwide operations of Air Force and Army warfighters, Special Operation Forces, and other government agencies with weather observing and forecasting capabilities at in-garrison and deployed locations, as well as centralized, reach-back capabilities.  Additionally, these funds integrate DoD, government agency, and commercial and international partners environmental data with AFWS information system equipment for processing, storing, exploiting and disseminating weather information for analysis, forecasting, and mission integration at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Weather system technological upgrades provide critical support to modern air and space combat operations. These systems enhance the lethality, effectiveness, and survivability of AF weapon systems and precision munitions by accurately predicting environmental impacts to optimize mission execution and planning, targeting, weaponeering, and battle damage assessment, as well as both AF and government agency space systems operations and effectiveness.\n\nAFWS aligns activities under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring\/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions. Of these four capability areas, two (Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination and Weather Forecasting) are addressed by APPN 3600, BA 07, PE 0305111F, Project 672738 - Weather Service. \n \n1. Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides centralized Weather Web Service capability, increased availability of weather impacts and products, improved global, regional, and theater-level forecasts, specific mission-tailored weather data on demand, and finally increased weapon system interoperability which shortens the Combatant Commander kill chain through machine to machine interfaces.  This is accomplished through large-scale data processing, product generation, a presentation system utilizing Open Geo-spatial Consortium (OGC) services architecture and providing the capability to ingest, process, store, access, and disseminate meteorological oceanographic (METOC) data. The Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination capability area includes activities for Weather Data Analysis and its follow-on increment, Weather Data Analysis Increment 5 (WDA and WDA-Inc 5). \n \n2. Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission execution, rehearsal, and planning. Weather Forecasting includes activities for Numerical Weather Modeling (NWM); Weather Services - Live, Virtual, Constructive (WS-LVC), and Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS).  SWAFS is a suite of programs consisting of Global Assimilation of Ionosphere Measurement-Full Physics (GAIM-FP), and (in FY2019) Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System-Radiation Exposure (SWAFS-RadEx). SWAFS provides decision makers with 1) Satellite operations, 2) Predictions of HF & UHF\/SHF (SATCOM) communications outages, 3) GPS inaccuracies in navigation & targeting, 4) Tracking objects like satellites, debris, projectiles in space and forecasts for radar outages and early warning radar false launch indications, 5) National, strategic, operational & tactical intelligence collection, 6) Radiation forecasts for high altitude\/space flight operations. \n\nThe use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

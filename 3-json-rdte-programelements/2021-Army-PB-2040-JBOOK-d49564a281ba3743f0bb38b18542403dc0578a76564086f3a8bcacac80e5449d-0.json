The TDI program's RDP was approved on 8 Nov 18 by the Army Requirement Board (ARB). Under subsequent reviews, the MDA approved a tailored defense unique software intensive acquisition approach for TDI. To support this agile acquisition approach, the TDI program office will develop and deploy pre-configured software in a series of capability drops in order to deliver full functional values of the RDP that align with DCO priorities. The TDI program had a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) of TDI's initial capability approved by the MDA on Sep 19, which allowed the program to achieve IOC Oct 19. TDI is hosted on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and will be fielded by the CPCE\/TSI program in accordance with their fielding schedule. Execution of the TDI program will be a combination of government entities and commercial vendors.\n\nThe ARB approved Cyber Analytics and DCO Tool Suite RDPs on 24 Apr 18; Mission Planning on 26 Jun 18; and User Activity Monitoring and Forensics and Malware on 16 Oct 18. The MDA designated these as ACAT IV programs. Under subsequent reviews, the MDA approved agile acquisition approach to develop and deliver pre-configured software in a series of releases and capability drops in order to deliver full functional values of the RDP that align with DCO priorities. DCO programs utilize standard and 874 agile pilot evolutionary acquisition processes (30-90 rapid acquisition approach). DCO continually delivers new technologies and capabilities as a prototype and fields updated capabilities. DCO contract strategy utilizes multiple existing contracts vehicles to include Other Transactional Authority (OTA), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)-based, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), and Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA)."

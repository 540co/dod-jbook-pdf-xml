The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS) and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for 140 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Missile Warning, Communications, Weather, Launch Vehicle Support, and Research and Development (R&D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts\/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command & control. During FY 2016 the AFSCN supported 11 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $2.7B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. In FY 2016, the AFSCN supported 21 NSS launches delivering $9.8B worth of satellites to their operational orbits. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence, and civil users. These efforts support cybersecurity operations and systems engineering and integration (SE&I) activities as well as aligning with the evolving Space Warfighter Construct (SWC), Space Enterprise Visions (SEV), Enterprise Ground Services (EGS), and Commercial Augmentation.\n\nREMOTE TRACKING STATION (RTS) BLOCK CHANGE (RBC) - SATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE; ENHANCED HIGH-POWER AMPLIFIER (EHPA): The Air Force will complete development testing of the Enhanced High Power Amplifier (EHPA) first article. The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system. The EHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue through the 2020s.\n\nUNIFIED S-BAND (USB) UPLINK: The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry by providing the capability to perform NSS spacecraft compatibility testing in both the current L-Band uplink\/S-Band downlink spectrum and the industry standard Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum. RDT&E funds supported a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN baseline to begin supporting factory compatibility testing of NSS spacecraft.  Development completed in FY16.\n\nAFSCN DEFICIENCY RESOLUTION: Provides test, cyber security, requirements management, and system architecture support to the AFSCN.\nELECTRONIC SCHEDULING AND DISSEMINATION: ESD will allow satellite operators to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas, automatically deconflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish the schedule in real-time to all users."

In addition, the PE enables concept exploration efforts and studies of alternative concepts.  The research projects are aligned with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priorities and designated focus areas that include non-system specific technology efforts and feasibility assessments and are formulated and managed by teams of subject matter experts drawn from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Services, and the Defense Agencies.

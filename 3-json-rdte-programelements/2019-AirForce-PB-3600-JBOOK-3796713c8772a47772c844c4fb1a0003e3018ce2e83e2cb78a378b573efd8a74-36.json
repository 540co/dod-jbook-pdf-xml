        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "This Program Element funds 1) the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface Multi-Service Execution Team (MET) Office (DMO) which oversees the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) Development and the DCGS Test and Community Support (D-TACS) Programs, 2) the Support to DCGS Enterprise Integrated Product Team (IPT) effort, and 3) the Imagery Processing effort which consists of the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) program.\n\n1) The DMO is the persistent, working level organization supporting the DCGS Family of Systems (FoS) interoperability efforts, for which the AF is lead service. The DCGS FoS, including AF DCGS, was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise, enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment. All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions. Specifically, DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development, upgrade, integration, test, and maintenance of the common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services. The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse. All the military Services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards through the Service DCGS Programs of Record (PoR), and are committed to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. The DCGS FoS is the core of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E), and the DIB forms the core of current DI2E interoperability. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nTo carry out its mission, the DMO manages multiple development and test programs. The DIB Development Program is responsible for DIB Development and the DCGS Test and Community Support (D-TACS) Program provides software test, Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V), and cybersecurity development for the products developed by the DIB Development Program. The D-TACS Program also provides a wide range of Community Support to the PoRs and the DCGS Enterprise, including Cybersecurity support. The Cybersecurity effort improves DCGS Enterprise Cybersecurity practices, including reciprocity. It also involves the development and review\nof new Cybersecurity practices within the US Government, including providing commentary to the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) and DoD Risk Management Framework Technical Advisory Group (RMF TAG) as directed by the DMO.\n\nThe D-TACS Program manages the DCGS Test Laboratory (DTL) at Hanscom AFB, MA and a mobile DCGS-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed currently located at Nellis AFB, NV. These facilities support software development and test and DI2E\/DCGS Enterprise evaluation and test events and exercises.\nThe DCGS Test Laboratory (DTL) conducts software development, test and test development, acceptance testing, including functional verification and validation and performance testing on DIB and DIB related software.\nDCGS-I Testbed is an integration and test environment, used by the Services and Agency DCGS Program Offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors, applications, and net-centric operations. This Testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment. Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture. The Testbed supports the annual DCGS test event Enterprise Challenge, multiple USAF Weapons School Integration (WSINT) events, USAF Warfare Center Red Flag events and Global Hawk Interoperability Tests.\n\n2) The Support to DCGS Enterprise IPT provides support to OUSD(I), AF DCGS and NATO interoperability efforts. This includes the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.\n\n3) The Imagery Processing effort develops the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) within the DCGS architecture. The VIP-C provides end-to-end image processing to include raw data ingest, data format standardization to facilitate exploitation, secondary image processing, metadata conditioning, and image quality enhancements. Current efforts are focused on ensuring new sensors being fielded and associated data types can be processed.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded.\n\nThis project is in Budget Activity (BA) 7 (Operational System Development) because this BA includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The DCGS FoS, including AF DCGS, was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise, enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment. All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions. Specifically, DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development, upgrade, integration, test, and maintenance of the common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services. The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse and provide an existing, flexible, and singularly sustainable path to information sharing across the global ISR enterprise. The deployment of the DIB into the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) Reference Implementation will provide common applications and services and a managed service framework for the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) Learning Environment (C4ILE) that supports the development, test and integration of machine-aided decision making capabilities. \n\nAll the military Services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards through the Service DCGS Programs of Record (PoR), and are committed to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. The DCGS FoS is the core of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E), and the DIB forms the core of current DI2E interoperability. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nTo carry out its mission, the DMO manages multiple development and test programs. The DIB Development Program is responsible for DIB Development and the DCGS Test and Community Support (D-TACS) Program provides software test, Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V), and cybersecurity development for the products developed by the DIB Development Program. The D-TACS Program also provides a wide range of Community Support to the PoRs and the DCGS Enterprise, including Cybersecurity support. The Cybersecurity effort improves DCGS Enterprise Cybersecurity practices, including reciprocity. It also involves the development and review of new Cybersecurity practices within the US Government, including providing commentary to the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) and DoD Risk Management Framework Technical Advisory Group (RMF TAG) as directed by the DMO.\n\nThe D-TACS Program manages the DCGS Test Laboratory (DTL) at Hanscom AFB, MA and a mobile DCGS-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed, currently located at Nellis AFB, NV. These facilities support software development and test and Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E)\/DCGS Enterprise evaluation and test events and exercises.\n\nThe DCGS Test Laboratory (DTL) conducts software development, test and test development, acceptance testing, including functional verification and validation and performance testing on DIB and DIB related software.\n\nDCGS-I Testbed is an integration and test environment, used by the Services and Agency DCGS Program Offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors, applications, and net-centric operations. This Testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment. Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture. The Testbed supports the annual DCGS test event Enterprise Challenge, multiple USAF Weapons School Integration (WSINT) events, USAF Warfare Center Red Flag events and Global Hawk Interoperability tests.\n\nThe funding also provides support to OUSD(I), AF DCGS and NATO interoperability efforts.  This includes the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability."

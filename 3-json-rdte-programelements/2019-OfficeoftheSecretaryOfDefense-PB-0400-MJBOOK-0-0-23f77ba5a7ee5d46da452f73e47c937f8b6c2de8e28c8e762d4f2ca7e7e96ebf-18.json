            "val": "To counter the United States\u2019 historic technological advantage, adversaries are increasingly developing asymmetric capabilities that are enabled by advanced commercial electronic components and devices that have become globally available.  These threats range from terrorist-employed improvised devices, small unmanned air systems, and easily transportable Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to dedicated military systems such as advanced sensor systems, advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) components and systems, advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and increasingly capable cruise and ballistic missiles that can diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.\n\nThe rate at which new threats are appearing continues to accelerate and the myriad of new advanced Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) threats have made operations in the EMS significantly more difficult and complex.  The challenges posed by new kinetic and non-kinetic EMS threats and the dire consequences of technology surprise highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative EW and EW-Cyber capabilities that can rapidly address these new threats in more cost-effective ways.\n\nThe Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program was established to address these challenges through efforts designed to significantly accelerate the development and transitioning of new EW and EW-Cyber capabilities.  To do this, the JEAT program explores, assesses, and validates a plethora of new technologies and approaches focusing specifically on technologies and approaches that fall outside the Services\u2019 Research and Development (R&D) programs or are being developed by the Services at rates that cannot not produce required capabilities in the needed timeframes to identify the most fruitful EW and EW-Cyber R&D opportunities for the Department.  To identify potential nearer-term and lower-cost solutions, the JEAT program also explores and assesses approaches that integrate and demonstrate off-the-shelf military and commercial technologies in innovative ways.  The JEAT program\u2019s approaches have provided substantial savings for the Services and the Department in both R&D efforts and in Programs of Record, and thus enable required military capabilities to be delivered to the warfighter much sooner than possible in traditional DoD approaches. \n\nJEAT program efforts are focused in four areas in two Project Codes.\n\n\u2022\tIn Project 619, Joint Electronic Advanced Technology, (1) the Experimentation\/Demonstration effort utilizes innovative field and laboratory experimentation venues to understand current and future threats and explore potential countermeasures and overmatch opportunities, (2) the Advanced Technology Development\/Verification effort explores technologies and approaches to counter advanced threats in innovative ways, and (3) the EW Collaboration and Planning effort ensures appropriate coordination and technological oversight of Department and Service EW and EW-Cyber R&D programs and processes and provides governance insights for senior decision makers.\n\n\u2022\tIn Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation, (4) this effort explores computer-augmented data dominance and machine learning technologies, tools, and approaches to enhance awareness and accelerate planning and decision making in essential EMS war fighting capabilities."

Project 619\u2019s three efforts, Experimentation\/Demonstration (Expt\/Demo), Advanced Technology Development\/Verification (ATD\/V), and Electronic Warfare Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&P), focus on enabling nearer-term technology transitions to the Services\u2019 Programs of Record (PoR) with reduced risk and cost.  Expt\/Demo efforts focus on exploring, demonstrating, and assessing innovative technologies and approaches to overcome existing and developing threats and provide new overmatch capabilities for the U.S. military.  ATD\/V efforts integrate advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in ways not being explored by the Services to demonstrate nearer-term technological opportunities.  EW C&P efforts within Electronic Warfare and Countermeasures Office (EWCO) of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering assess, ensure coordination, and provide senior leadership insights on all Departmental EW and EW-Cyber Research and Development (R&D) as well as coordinating national and international EW and EW-Cyber efforts. \n\nExperimentation\/Demonstration (Expt\/Demo):\n\nExpt\/Demo explores and demonstrates new EW and EW-Cyber technologies and approaches through the use of large-scale, dynamic field experimentation venues.  The current venue, Vigilant Hammer (VH), is a multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive event focused on advancing the state of the art for detecting, classifying, geolocating, and engaging of electromagnetic signals of interest.  Modeled after Project 619\u2019s highly successful BLACK DART, TRIDENT SPECTRE, and Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE) venues, VH includes both scripted and dynamic scenarios to give participants an opportunity to explore the efficacy of existing and new capabilities and approaches to engage emerging Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) threats.  Follow-on venues will address concerns such as multi-platform\/multi-aperture, collaborative\/coherent EW and multistatic passive\/active sensing architectures.\n\nAdvanced Technology Development\/Verification (ATD\/V):\n\nATD\/V explores, matures and assesses emerging technologies and approaches to address compelling EW and EW-Cyber warfighting needs.  Project 619\u2019s ongoing ATD\/V effort, the Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) Laboratory, explores, matures and assesses emerging EW and EW-Cyber technologies to enable, for example, multi-aperture collaborative\/coherent EW and EW-Cyber employment through exquisite coordination of sensing and electronic attack capabilities. \n\nEW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&P):\n\nEW C&P supports all activities of the Director, EWCO, related to the selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of all EW and EW-Cyber-related efforts across DoD.  EW C&P oversees and ensures coordination and collaboration between OSD and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, and the Services on all EW and EW-Cyber activities within DoD.  To do this, EW C&P identifies, assesses, and develops recommendations to address EW and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensor, seeker, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures, and battle management technologies.  EW C&P also provides programmatic recommendations and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)) on PoR, including technology maturity and availability, Critical Program Information standards, Foreign Disclosure, and Technical Signals Requirements.  EW C&P also conducts and leads analyses of advanced threats and technological opportunities to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&D research, development and acquisition efforts."

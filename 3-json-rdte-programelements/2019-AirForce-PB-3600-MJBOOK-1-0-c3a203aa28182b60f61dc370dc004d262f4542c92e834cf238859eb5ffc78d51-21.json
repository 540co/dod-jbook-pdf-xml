The 3DELRR system will provide multiple benefits and increased capabilities to the USAF and to the Joint Services: 1) Replace the aging USAF AN\/TPS-75 radar system, which is at the end of its service life and costly to maintain; 2) Detect and track highly maneuverable, small radar cross section air-breathing targets; 3) Mitigate reliability, operational availability, maintainability, transportability and sustainability issues, which plague the AN\/TPS-75 radar system; 4) Enable greater battlefield and battlespace awareness through its precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to control individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions; 5) Serve as a pilot program for Defense Exportability Features (DEF) to maximize export potential early in the design phase while reducing 3DELRR life cycle costs through increased production; and 6) Provide exchange of information to the United States Marine Corps (Navy) and the United States Army via appropriate interfaces.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nNote: This program is in Budget Authority 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

A limited competition was conducted for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract among the multiple contractors that participated in two Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phases. \n\nThe EMD contract was awarded 11 May 2017 to a single developer to complete the final design, build, integration and test of the 3DELRR system; with options to produce Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units, conduct Interim Contractor Support (ICS), and produce Full Rate Production (FRP) units.\n\nThe primary contract type for EMD is a Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF). The contract also includes a FPIF option to execute LRIP, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) options for ICS and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) options for FRP. A CPFF option is planned for ICS due to the uncertainty of the quantity and the exact nature of the work. An FFP option is planned for FRP due to stable requirements and low risk of changes in scope. The program office will exercise the LRIP option upon Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approval at MS C. The program office will also seek MDA approval to exercise ICS options (as necessary) and FRP options. \n\nThe EMD prime contractor will deliver three (3) EMD units, which will be the primary assets used for Contractor Developmental Test and Evaluation (CDT&E) and Government Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E). The LRIP option provides scope for the retrofit of these three (3) EMD units to production quality specifications, which will be used for Government operational testing. The LRIP option also enables the delivery of three (3) additional production quality units for a total of six (6) units at Initial Operational Capability (IOC). Program office will request MDA approval to use procurement funds prior to MS C to procure early Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) materials to reduce schedule risk. The FRP options will deliver an additional twenty-nine (29) units for a total of thirty-five (35) units at Full Operational Capability (FOC).\n\nThe MDA for the 3DELRR program is the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition). The Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO BM) located at Hanscom AFB, MA is the PEO for 3DELRR. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) located at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is the contracting authority for the 3DELRR program, as AFLCMC provides contracting, legal, comptroller, programmatic, engineering, test and logistics support."

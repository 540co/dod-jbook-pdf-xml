This effort was delayed one year as a result of the AOC 10.2 Critical Change which delayed integration into current AOC WS baseline.\n\nThe Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS) program element provides development of Command and Control (C2) capabilities across the entire spectrum of air and space operations from the strategic to the tactical level.  There are four funded projects within the AOC WS program element:\n\nAOC WS Modifications allow for the consolidation to a single baseline across the AOC WS enterprise and provide required modifications and pathfinder efforts for the AOC WS to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integration, testing, fielding, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades.  Modifications are required for the AOC WS to keep pace with evolving Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) components, integrated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, and changes in the underlying Information Technology (IT) environment, as well as to deliver effective training solutions for the user.\n\nApplications Development provides worldwide operational level C2 capabilities, which include: air battle planning, management, and execution; operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (C2 of IAMD); in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.\n\nUnit Command and Control (UC2) provides both scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions of future Air Battle Planning.\n\nPersonnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and situationally-appropriate personnel recovery C2 system which supports personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across the Range of Military Operations in the joint\/coalition operating environment.  The system collects, stores and delivers personnel\/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis\/assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across DoD and other national and international entities.\n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The C\/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined\/Joint Forces Commander (C\/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C\/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.\n\nIn FY 2017, AOC WS Modifications was a new start.\n\nIn FY18, AOC WS Modifications are required to enable the retirement of Theater Battle Management Core System Force Level (TBMCS FL) and the legacy AOC 10.1 system.  Further, AOC WS Modifications are required for the AOC to keep pace with evolving COTS\/GOTS components, DoD directives, changes in the underlying IT environment, and to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integration, testing, fielding, training, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades to the AOC WS.  Additionally, in FY18 AOC WS Modification activities evolve the AOC through development, integration, and test of progressively improving capabilities in support of mission requirements at Geographic and Global (formerly Functional) AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units, keeping the AOC current and interoperable with the Combatant Commands (CCMD), cyber requirements, and next generation weapon systems\/weapons.\n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The second increment, Increment 10.1, upgraded these locations to an integrated baseline and fielded the baseline to additional operational and reserve units worldwide.  The AOC 10.2, evolves the AOC to a Net-Centric environment, compliant with DoD SOA standards.  The AOC WS Modifications program builds upon these evolutionary weapon system updates to develop, integrate, test, train, deliver, and sustain new capabilities and baseline updates to the AOC WS.  The AOC WS Modifications program will leverage an AOC WS Long-Term Modification and Sustainment (LTM&S) contract, awarded in 3QFY17, which will provide for government led integration of the AOC WS enterprise.  The AOC WS Program Management Office (PMO) will provide technical oversight to the AOC WS Modification program, led by a Government AOC Weapon System (WS) Chief Engineer.  Additionally, significant technical expertise will be provided by MITRE, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and Engineering & Technology Acquisition Support Services contractors."

These efforts focus on support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other AF and Joint Services C2 systems.  Application Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013).  These activities include C2 Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012).  C2AOS-C2IS creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest.  C2AOS-C2IS also develops, matures, fields, and maintains modular net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions. These applications include Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); the remainder of the CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems - Force Level (TBMCS FL) functionality; services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a JC2 Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nIn FY 2017, C2AOS-C2IS Modifications was a new start.  This effort was delayed one year as a result of the AOC 10.2 Critical Change which delayed integration into current AOC WS baseline.\n\n\nIn FY18, core development activities will be complete and focus will be on testing, addressing discrepancies discovered during testing, Information Assurance (IA), and the start of modernization planning for 4th\/5th generation fighter platforms.\n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

UC2 is fielded to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Crisis Action Team (CAT), and many other work-centers.    \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nIn FY18, core development activities will be to complete development of UC2 1.3 which will allow UC2 to be accessed on mobile platforms.  Additional FY18 activities will include resolving deficiencies discovered during developmental tests (DT), maintaining information assurance (IA) posture, and ensuring integration and testing of UC2 interfaces with other applications. \n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program develops and delivers tools and services for planning, collaborating and managing search and rescue efforts, as well as disseminating related information to all personnel recovery mission coordinators across the PR network.  PRC2 provides an adaptive and networked system, delivering timely situational awareness information supporting personnel accountability and recovery mission management worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated set of capabilities to prevent, prepare for and respond to joint\/coalition military personnel recovery activities, and civilian rescue missions.  The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) Initial Capability Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.\n\nThe system collects, stores and delivers personnel\/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities.  The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nIn FY 2018, PE 0207410F, Air & Space Operations Center (AOC), Project Number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2), efforts were transferred to PE 0305984F, Personnel Recovery Command & Ctrl (PRC2), Project Number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2), in order to improve visibility on Service's fair share of development funding for this joint interest program.\n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, as well as the maturation and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Benefits include maturing technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, informing emerging requirements for future programs of record, and reducing technology risk in order to transition of leap-ahead capabilities into acquisition programs. In Project DS3, Technology Maturation Initiative efforts mature and integrate advanced component technologies into system and sub-system technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes, which are then validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and programs of record. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms. Project EX3 funds experimental prototyping and demonstration of ground vehicles to assess future concepts and designs against selected capability trades, and emerging technologies for current and future combat vehicles across the combat vehicle portfolio. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) efforts and acquisition programs.  Efforts in this PE support the Cross-Functional Teams established by the Army to speed materiel development activities in support of the Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering S&T priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. This investment supports the Army Modernization priorities, including future capability opportunities for the Network, Next Generation Combat Vehicle, and Air and Missile Defense.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), the Engineer Research Development Center (ERDC), and US Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT)."

Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) efforts mature and integrate component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes are validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation and acquisition efforts to inform requirements for future programs of record and reduce the risk of technology insertion. These efforts are typically 2-4 years in duration, and are approved by Army senior leadership based on priority and opportunity, to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Activities include the maturation, integration, and demonstration of HEL prototype weapons performance on a combat platform in realistic operational environments, in support of the Army's objective capability for Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD). A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sensors, and optics for maneuvering brigade combat teams (BCTs). Activities also include sub-system prototyping and integration of leap-ahead ground combat vehicle powertrain technologies; and integration and demonstration of key Active Protection System (APS) components to provide modular and layered vehicle protection effects (hard-kill and soft-kill), enabling power projection and enhanced survivability. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms.

            "val": "The Requirements Analysis and Maturation (RAM) program funds development planning (DP) to include early systems engineering and integrated simulation and analysis. These activities include requirements analysis, capability decomposition and trade space characterization, concept development (system of systems, air, space, and cyber) and architecture design and development, cost analysis, modeling and simulation of representative or prototype systems, and analytical tools. Outcomes of these activities are technologically informed requirements, mature concepts that are technically feasible, and areas for science and technology (S&T) investment to reduce technology risks. These activities provide the analytic basis for cost and capability trades driving non-materiel solutions, and\/or materiel solutions. Early-phase systems engineering and technical planning activities funded by this program provide the foundation for informed investment decisions leading to successful acquisition programs. Development planning efforts are coordinated with the Air Force Capability Development Council, Air Force Warfighting Integration Capability, and\/or SAF\/AQ to ensure funding supports the highest Air Force priorities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver development planning and integrated simulation and analysis capabilities (to include Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) support and Joint Simulation Environment (JSE) capability). The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

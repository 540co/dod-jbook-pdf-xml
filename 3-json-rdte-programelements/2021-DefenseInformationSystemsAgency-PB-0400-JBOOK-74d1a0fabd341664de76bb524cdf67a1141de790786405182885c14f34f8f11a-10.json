                "val": "The increase of +$22.651 in FY2019 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs (-$0.066) and an increase of +$22.717 received through a congressional reprogramming action for Secure Application Development (DevSecOps) (+$4.500); Identity Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) (+$12.200) and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) (+$6.000).  DevSecOps is to develop integrated tools and standards that enable users and partners to develop, deploy, and operate applications in a security and flexible environment.  ICAM will standardize credentialing capabilities for secure access to mobile devices and ZTA implements the Department's security protocols by continuously verifying everyone within the network.\n\nThe decrease of -$2.398 in FY 2020 is attributable to the Congressional directed transfer of Sharkseer from NSA to DISA ($1.882) and a Congressional general reduction of -$4.280 for unjustified growth.  \n\nThe decrease of -$3.982 in FY 2021 is due to an increase for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to further develop the DoD architectures for Zero-Trust Architecture and lab development (+$2.462) and a decrease due to the elimination of the DISA Cybersecurity Information Assurance Range, to avoid duplication of effort with the CYBERCOM Range under development.

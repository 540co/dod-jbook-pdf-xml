This effort initially focused on addressing DoD unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), to include integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and a common, interoperable ground station architecture and associated interface standards. While UAS initially were the primary focus, interoperability among all unmanned and manned systems is the long-term goal."

The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within US and foreign national airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system to provide a solution for improved airspace access in terminal operations as well as operations\/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at Fort Hood, Shadow operations at Cherry Point). This system will provide a near-term solution and is an integral part of the long-term permanent solution. Long term GBSAA systems and Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) architectures, operating concepts, standards and technology are being developed to allow DoD, commercial and private manned and Group 1-5 Unmanned Aircraft to operate safely and effectively in the national Airspace.  The change in airspace procedures, Airspace de-confliction and Traffic Management requires new processes and procedures for safe and secure national airspace access.  \n \nThis joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, policy, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems."

This program has provided joint funding to accelerate the development of SAA technology and standards to enable UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.  This program also supports development of UAS airspace integration policy and standards, as well as the modeling, simulation, and operational analysis needed to validate the standards.  In FY 2013 ABSAA and GBSAA efforts transitioned to the Services."

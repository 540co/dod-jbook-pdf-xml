The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. \n- One hundred percent of completed capability development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories, and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.\n- Fifty percent of next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application."

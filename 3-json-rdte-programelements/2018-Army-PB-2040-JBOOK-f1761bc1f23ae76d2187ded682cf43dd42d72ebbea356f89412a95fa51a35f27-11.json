The procurement specialist conducted and compiled results from a Request For Information (RFI) from industry, a draft RFP with an industry day and prepared for release of the development RFP.\n\nThe REP program utilized an established website where industry and government submits initiative proposals. Per standard operating procedure (SOP) and Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between PEO CS&CSS and TRADOC\/MCOE, a monthly stakeholders working group has proven continually effective in reviewing emerging capabilities leading towards a biannual Council of Colonels (CoC) review and selections of proposals in support of Center of Excellence (CoE) determined REP initiatives.

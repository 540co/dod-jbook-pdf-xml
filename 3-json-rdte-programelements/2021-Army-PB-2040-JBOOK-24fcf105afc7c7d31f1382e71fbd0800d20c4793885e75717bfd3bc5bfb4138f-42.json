            "val": "Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced commercial capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of software capability drop releases will be provided into Army Common\/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.\n\nDCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI).  \n\nDCGS-A provides technologically advanced Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  \n\nFY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $47.204 million for D07, DCGS-A, will be used for modification, testing and integration of commercially available technologies to support multi-source intelligence processing at all echelons, as directed in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 113 and Section 220 that will increase the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability to meet the Army requirements. DCGS-A will focus on Capability Drop upgrades and modifications to prototype and integrate Intelligence Applications into the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) and within a cloud computing environment.  Intelligence Applications will begin in FY 2021 with an All-Source Intelligence and collection management capability to streamline and simplify the intelligence process at the tactical echelons, in a fast-paced multi-domain environment.   DCGS-A will also begin Next Generation Analytics preparation activities to include market research, studies, and evaluations for the following applications: Open Source (OSINT) applications, Counter Intelligence and Human Intelligence Reporting capabilities (CI\/HUMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) analysis, Intelligence Support to Cyber Operations, and Geospatial analytics capabilities.  Activities will include the exploration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms, and will leverage opportunities for integration into DCGS-A.   DCGS-A will also assess solutions to replace the aging Tactical Entity Database with a new database solution at the tactical echelons, fully integrated into CPCE.  In FY 2021, DCGS-A will evaluate a new sensor downlink solution to consolidate the capabilities of the legacy Tactical Ground Station, Operational Ground Station, Remote Ground Terminal and AMDAS Dissemination Vehicle onto a single platform with updated commercial technologies and to keep pace with emerging high altitude and space sensor technologies.  The program will evaluate Capability Drop-2 solutions and design and develop alternative Industry software solutions to process and fuse space, aerial, and terrestrial sensor data to produce targeting solutions for long-range precision fires."

The DCGS-A program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively provide and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment\/hardware, providing low risk, efficient, time- phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army's operational needs.\n\nThe DCGS-A capabilities under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the future DCGS-A requirements set. The DCGS-A will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.\n\nDCGS-A is a collection of software packages (COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data. DCGS-A delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon's intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons.  DCGS-A provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.\n\nThe DCGS-A software baseline will be updated and iteratively deployed to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements. PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, will  align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk integration and test cycle times. As requirements are approved, DCGS-A will leverage commercially-available solutions and non-developmental items (NDI) to meet user needs, based on market research results.   DCGS-A will issue commercial contracts or conduct NDI technology transitions from DoD Science and Technology organizations, or will re-use NDI from other Army programs, Services, or other Governmental Agencies. The DCGS-A software will be hardware agnostic so that the software can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment. This allows the DCGS-A software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons. The implementation of the latest COTS hardware procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, will result in significant cost efficiencies."

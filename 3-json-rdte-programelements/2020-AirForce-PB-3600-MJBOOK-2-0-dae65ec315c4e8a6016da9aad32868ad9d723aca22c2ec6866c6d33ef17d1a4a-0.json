ABMS is not a single program of record but a capability that is provided by multiple integrated systems and programs and will be horizontally managed by the ABMS Architect.  ABMS will develop sensors, battle management and command and control systems, and communications through a three phased strategy.  Funding in this program element will be used for execution of efforts under the ABMS Architect Activities: sensor development, prototyping and risk reduction, architecture analysis, development and management of open architecture standards, Phase 1 and Phase 2 bridge capabilities, and Phase 3 development.  Funding may be used to fund other programs within the ABMS architecture.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ABMS.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

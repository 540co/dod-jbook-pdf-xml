Current projects in this program include Civil Engineering Readiness (Project 652895) and Aeromedical Readiness (Project 654910). Civil Engineering Readiness projects enable airfield protection, and airfield damage recovery for sustainment, and increased resiliency of airfield operations anywhere in the world. Aeromedical Readiness projects provide aerospace medical systems and treatment equipment to improve casualty care and meet worldwide warfighter medical operational requirements.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the Civil Engineering and Aeromedical Readiness capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

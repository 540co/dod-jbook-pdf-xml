            "val": "The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's newest generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify\/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the United States (U.S.) Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT). Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.  \n\nAirborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 in accordance with the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8). Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.\n\nThe RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is a fixed-wing, airborne COMINT and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) collection and precision targeting location system. GRCS provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify\/identify high value targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army INSCOM Aerial Exploitation Battalions providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. The Army's Acquisition Objective\/Army's Procurement Objective is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd Ml; and seven (7) fielded to the 204th Ml, and five (5) trainers within TRADOC and INSCOM. Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.\n\nGRCS is the only Army AISR system that currently provides extended range COMINT and ELINT capabilities to support long range targeting of near-peer threats in an A2AD environment. \n\nResearch Development Technology & Evaluation (RDT&E) and procurement funding currently planned will address obsolescence issues for critical SIGINT and ELINT capabilities on the GRCS platform. These investments ensure GRCS AISR support in the A2AD environment is not impacted, which would prevent critical intelligence collection at large standoff which is needed to address long range targeting of near-peer threats and maintain system relevancy."

It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify\/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the United States (U.S.) Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT).\n\nThis funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter:  Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar \/ Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI) Radar; Line-Of-Site (LOS) and Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. \n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding in the amount of $6.290 million continues the development of sensor enhancements through SIGINT software porting and development of new SIGINT software focusing on new signal sets applicable in a near peer environment. This funding also initiates SIGINT architecture development to exploit additional signals of interest relative to MDO, and a SIGINT server leveraging development of other services and facilitating rapid and continuous integration of capabilities targeting emerging signal sets and threats. This SIGINT architecture development work continues through FY 2025."

ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the United States (U.S.) Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2021 Base funding of $16.575 million will fund the development of the Long Range Radar Electronic Protection Measure software which will allow the Long Range Radar to support the warfighter in a contested electromagnetic spectrum. This funding line also continues the new signal enhancement development effort to complete Signal 3 and begins the development of software to enhance the COMINT collection capabilities with the lab and flight test for Signal 5 to meet the requirements in the ARL-E CPD."

It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify\/identify critical targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) United States (U.S.) Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. In accordance with the Army's AISR 2020 strategy, the Army's Acquisition Objective\/Army's Procurement Objective (AAO\/APO) is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd MI BN; seven (7) fielded to the 204th MI BN, and five (5) pilot trainers to support Force Generation. The five (5) trainers are not equipped with Primary Mission Equipment (PME).\n\nGRCS Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Research Development Technology & Evaluation (RDT&E) funding request in the amount of $3.996 million supports GRCS advanced signal enhancement efforts, development and testing of the signal enhancement infrastructure for GRCS updated SIGINT sensor capabilities.  GRCS is the only Army AISR system that currently provides extended range COMINT and ELINT capabilities to support long range targeting of near-peer threats in an A2AD environment.  RDTE and procurement funding currently planned will address obsolescence issues for critical SIGINT and ELINT capabilities on the GRCS platform. These investments ensure GRCS AISR support in the A2AD environment is not impacted, which would prevent critical intelligence collection at large standoff which is needed to address long range targeting of near-peer threats and maintain system relevancy."

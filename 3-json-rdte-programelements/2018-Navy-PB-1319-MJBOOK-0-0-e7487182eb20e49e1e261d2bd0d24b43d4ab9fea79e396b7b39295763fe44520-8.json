            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan, approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 January 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO\/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Emphasis is placed on passive sensors and active and passive countermeasure (CM) systems that exploit and counter a broad range of electromagnetic threats.  The focus is on maintaining near perfect, real-time knowledge of the enemy; countering the threat of missiles against deployed Naval forces; precision identification and location of threat emitters; and development of technologies that have broad application across multiple disciplines within the EW mission area.  This activity also includes developments to protect these technologies from external interference, and modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies.  Also included is technology development in support of the Integrated Distributed Electronic Warfare System (IDEWS) concept.  \n\nThe objectives reported in prior years under this R-2 Activity have been consolidated into the current objectives described below.\n\nThe current objectives are:\n\n- EW RF Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum (covering frequencies from kilohertz to terahertz) that include developments in detection, signal processing and passive\/active techniques for wideband Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP) and the Electronic Support (ES) mission areas. \n\n- EW EO\/IR Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO\/IR) spectral domain (extending from the ultraviolet to the far infrared spectral bands) that include advances in multispectral sensors, multiband sources, beam forming\/steering, and signal processing and transmission. \n\n- EW Integrated and Networked Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable an increased situational awareness and response across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) with broad spatial coverage using all available EW assets to provide coordinated, adaptive and networked EW sensing, protection and attack.\n\n- Advanced EW Enabling Technologies: Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements.\n\n- Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command & Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20): Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.\n\nDecrease in funding from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to:\n- Completion of exploratory research into advanced technologies to counter emerging threats operating in higher bands of the radio frequency spectrum utilizing extreme spectral and temporal agility.\n\n- Starting in FY 2018, all Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments in Electromagnetic Maneuver Command & Control (EMC2) Warfare will be shown in the new INP PE 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Research to better convey exactly what the Office of Naval Research is working on in this area.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

Each PE Activity has unique goals and metrics, some of which include classified quantitative measurements.  Overall metric goals are focused on achieving sufficient improvement in component or system capability such that the 6.2 applied research projects meet the need of, or produce a demand for, inclusion in advanced technology that may lead to incorporation into acquisition programs or industry products available to acquisition programs.\n\nSpecific examples of metrics under this PE include:\n\n- Provide a secure, over the horizon, on-the- move capability to communicate with higher headquarters at a data rate of 256-512 Kbps at a cost of $75,000.\n- Provide an array configuration suitable for installation on aircraft that will support Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) data rates of 10.7 and 45 Mbps at greater than 150 nautical mile range.\n- Develop prototype Ku band phased array apertures in a form factor suitable for installation on the CVN-78."

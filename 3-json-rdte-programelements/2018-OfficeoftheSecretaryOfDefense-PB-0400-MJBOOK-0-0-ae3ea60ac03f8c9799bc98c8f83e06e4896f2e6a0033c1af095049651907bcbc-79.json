R&D prototypes are transitioned to Service and Agency programs for sustainment, maintenance, and capacity programming.

The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. \n- One hundred percent of completed prototype development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories, and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.\n- Fifty percent of prototypes and next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application."

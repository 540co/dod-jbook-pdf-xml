The F-22 is a multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of F-22 acquisition is complete. The program is now continuing pre-planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities. The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, electronic warfare (EW), and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.\n\nThe F-22 Raptor's Operational Flight Program (OFP) is conducted using AGILE system development environments. Program Office executing Agile environment to evolve modernization activities into a single development stream in order to prototype a new acquisition construct. The AGILE environment allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software\/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a schedule cadence for capabilities as they mature.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-22 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The programs will provide Open Systems Architecture (OSA), Link 16 Transmit and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Transpond\/Interrogate on the F-22 Block 30\/35 combat coded F-22 fleet. \n  \nIn FY 2017 the budget began to reflect the TACLink 16 program. The F-22  recognized a valuable opportunity to field OSA and Link 16 Transmit earlier than originally planned under the F-22 Tactical Mandates. The Link 16 Transmit enables 5th generation F-22 fighter aircraft to transmit tactical information through datalink to the 5th generation F-35 (a.k.a. 5th-to-5th), as well as to 4th generation aircraft (a.k.a. 5th-to-4th). Transmitting tactical data to other aircraft types via datalink is a top Air Force priority. With Link 16 Transmit, the F-22's superior 5th Generation sensor suite will critically support the situational awareness of all participants in the operational environment.  The TACLink 16 program accelerates the installation of this key data link capability. Additionally, the TACLink 16 will enable future life cycle savings opportunities for the F-22 and  provide risk reduction effort for the F-22 Tactical Mandates program. \n\nThe F-22 Tactical Mandates program (product line) is conducted using AGILE system development environments. The AGILE environment allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software\/hardware from multiple programs using a schedule cadence for capabilities as they mature. \n\nThe F-22 Tactical Mandates program will field Mode 5 IFF on the TACLink 16 baseline. Mode 5 IFF is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council-mandated Blue Force identification capability that improves Raptor survivability and reduces fratricide risk DoD-wide.  Mode 5 IFF brings significantly enhanced combat identification in both quality and security over the F-22's legacy Mode 4 capability.  This update is particularly critical given Mode 4 functionality may be unavailable when F-22 Tactical Mandates fields."

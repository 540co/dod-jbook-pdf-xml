            "val": "The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-     Approve component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS). \n-     Approve component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-     Oversee Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-     Report results of OT&E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n-     Review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability\n (IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nDOT&E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfare capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for their capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

Funding for FY 2019 provides Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and OUSD(AT&L). Key elements of DOT&E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2019 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List. \n\nCyber Evaluations\n\nOSD-mandated staff reductions planned for FY2019 will require DOT&E to reduce the number of planned assessments in FY2019 and beyond. Each assessment will continue to include \u201cFind-Fix-Verify\u201d efforts as described above. DOT&E plans to continue working with the CCMDs and Services to develop multiyear plans for exercise cyber assessments and CRC events. These plans will focus on assessing the CCMD\u2019s or Service\u2019s ability to complete missions and be resilient in a contested cyber environment. DOT&E will perform year-round and long-duration assessments of all CCMDs and Services with Global PCO authorities. Objectives for DOT&E assessments in FY 2019 will include the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats and the assessment of operational missions during realistic cyber attacks, with supporting offensive fires and cyber-range events included in the evaluation. DOT&E will assess Cyber Protection Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC, or exercise events. DOT&E will continue assessments of offensive cyber capabilities, consider the development of a potential cyber variant of the Joint Munition Effectiveness Manual, and continue to fund joint assessments of Mode 5 Identification of Friend or Foe capabilities in support of acquisition programs.  DOT&E will transmit critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD\u2019s cybersecurity posture. FY 2019 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs."

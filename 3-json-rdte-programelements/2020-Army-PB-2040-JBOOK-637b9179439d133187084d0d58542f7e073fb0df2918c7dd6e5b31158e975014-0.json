            "val": "Program element 0603778A supports development and testing of the Army's rocket launcher fleet, including the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher. MLRS and HIMARS launchers support the Army's number one priority modernization effort, Long Range Precision Fires.  Updated launchers are required to fire current and developmental munitions such as the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS).\n\nProject 093. The M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets\/missiles from the current and emerging Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges in excess of 400 kilometers.  Project 093 funds software development, training updates, Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) technology implementation, and integration of satellite communications for the MLRS launcher.\n\nJustification:\nFY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $9.563 million for Project 093 continues tactical launcher software development and testing to support the Fire Control System (FCS) obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a MLRS launcher.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher.  The increase from FY2019 funds additional research and development related to Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-Jam, Anti-Spoofing capabilities, and integration of satellite communications, allowing the MLRS to continue to effectively operate in near peer threat environments.  Conducts delta testing of the Improved Armored Cab (IAC) with the new vendor.\n\nProject DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the current and emerging Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges in excess of 400 kilometers.   Project DX8 funds software development, training updates, and Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) technology implementation for the HIMARS launcher. \n\nJustification:\nFY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $13.314 million for Project DX8 continues tactical launcher software development and testing to support the Fire Control System (FCS) obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a HIMARS launcher.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher.

HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the current and emerging Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges in excess of 400 kilometers.   Project DX8 funds software development, training updates, and Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) technology implementation for the HIMARS launcher. \n\nJustification:\nFY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $13.314 million for Project DX8 continues tactical launcher software development and testing to support the Fire Control System (FCS) obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a HIMARS launcher.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher.  The increase from FY 2019 funds additional research and development related to Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-Jam, Anti-Spoofing capabilities, and integration of satellite communications, allowing the HIMARS to continue to effectively operate in near peer threat environments."

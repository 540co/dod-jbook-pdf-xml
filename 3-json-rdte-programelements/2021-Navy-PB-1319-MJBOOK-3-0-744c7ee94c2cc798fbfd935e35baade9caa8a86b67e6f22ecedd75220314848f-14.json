DoD mandated an increase in Cyber Security testing due to an increase in cyber intrusions from adversaries. Cyber intrusions continue to challenge our weapon systems' ability to detect threats, react to threats, and restore system functionality after a cyber-attack. Cyber intrusion prevention requires specialized training, tool sets, and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.\n\nThe FY 2021 funding increase continues to support the Network Modernization effort. Part of this\nmodernization will strengthen COMOPTEVFOR's presence on the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN) and\nenhance collaboration, access and data flow to stakeholders operating on NMCI. COMOPTEVOR legacy unclassified and\nclassified networks prevent collaboration, sharing, and access to operational test tools, test results, and data with Commands that work for COMOPTEVOR while executing operational testing (VX-1, VX-9, VMX-1, HMX-1), organizations that use\noperational test products (SYSCOMs, PEO\/PMs, Fleet Shore Commands), and VCNO, OPNAV\n\n\n\n\nTechnical: N\/A\n\nSchedule: N\/A"

This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness, suitability, and cyber survivability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop \"minimum, adequate\" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT Network, database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems. OT&E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and warfighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources."

The COE provides highly specialized analysis, assessment and performance monitoring expertise to Headquarters Air Force, AF major commands (MAJCOM), and weapon system program offices regarding CNS\/ATM system technical functions and performance standards for safe and efficient operations in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.  This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 30 AF weapon system program offices with resident CNS\/ATM technical expertise. \n\nThis funding enables the AMSD to monitor and participate in government and industry technical forums and U.S. and International civil aviation standards bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) and others, responsible for the development and assessment of international civil aviation standards for safe and efficient operations in worldwide airspace.  Division personnel analyze civil standards as they are being developed and work to influence them to support Department of Defense (DoD) interests.  CNS\/ATM COE experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria established by DoD and these standards bodies and document them in generic performance matrices (GPMs).  The COE works with MAJCOM and program office personnel to develop strategies for implementing CNS\/ATM requirements on AF weapon systems and tailor the GPMs to each platform's unique avionics architecture and operational mission.  Once CNS\/ATM component integration and testing is completed, COE personnel validate platform CNS\/ATM performance against the standards necessary to operate in worldwide civil airspace.  This assessment is submitted to the aircraft program office and becomes part of their Airworthiness certification package.  \n\nThe program office provides technical analysis and assessments of CNS\/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment throughout the lifecycle of aircraft platforms.  Efforts include and are not limited to performance assessment, test support, performance monitoring, interoperability testing, cybersecurity assessments, and the development and assessment of CNS\/ATM capabilities for unmanned platforms such as location-specific Ground Based Detect and Avoid radar and airspace (GBDAA) characterization.\n\nThe program office office administers the electronic DoD Avionics Equipment Catalog (iGATM) through an Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle that enables centralized procurement of CNS\/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment and manages other contracts offering technical engineering services to aircraft platform program offices.  Technical engineering services may include and is not limited to performance monitoring, interoperability testing, cybersecurity assessments, and development and assessment of CNS\/ATM capabilities for unmanned platforms such as location-specific GBDAA characterization.   These contracts are used by aircraft program offices across the DoD, among other federal agencies, and in support of foreign military sales.\n\nThe program office performs periodic and event driven audits required by civil aviation assurance standards on processes used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) to DoD users. This electronic navigation database, developed and maintained by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), contains critical safety of flight information used by all DoD flight crews to fly instrument flight rules procedures worldwide.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CNS\/ATM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

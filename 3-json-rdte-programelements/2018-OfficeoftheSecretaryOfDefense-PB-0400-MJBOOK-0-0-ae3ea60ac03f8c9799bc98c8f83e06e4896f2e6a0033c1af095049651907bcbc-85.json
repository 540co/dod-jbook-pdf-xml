Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nA focal point of this program is development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness on 23 December 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities.  Gaining situational awareness of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and risks, as well as U.S. and international efforts to counter WMD proliferation, is time-consuming and difficult. Relevant information is spread across disconnected systems, on multiple networks, and in the open source domain, making it difficult to discover and use information to support mission needs. WMD-related situations in recent years, including the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and the response to the West African Ebola outbreak, have demonstrated the need for Combatant Commands to access and share CWMD information, collaborate on planning and operations, and have a common understanding of the operational environment with mission partners.  \n\nThe CWMD Systems program provides funding for two technology-enabled fusion cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which utilize information systems and applications to enable CWMD situational awareness. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Software development for new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The DTRA and DIA cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (ORC-2531).\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. \n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

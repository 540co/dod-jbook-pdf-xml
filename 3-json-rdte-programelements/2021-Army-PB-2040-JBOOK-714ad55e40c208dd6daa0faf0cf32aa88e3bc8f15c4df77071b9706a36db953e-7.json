            "val": "Program Element (PE) 0604633A Air Traffic Control funds continuous efforts in the development of modernized tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems that enable safety of aircraft operations. ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil, military, domestic and international ATC mandates and combat identification requirements.\n\nThe Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) is the Army's program of record for Airspace Control and enroute Air Traffic Services. It requires development, testing and integration of new web-based services for Airspace Control in order to maintain compatibility and interoperability with the Army Mission Command Information System. TAIS includes development and testing of improvements to incorporate emerging Air Force interfaces, ability to simultaneously connect to multiple sensor systems to receive and process situational awareness information, the capability to connect to sensors to enhance available situational awareness thus reducing risk to aviation and ground forces, and to implement new software features for use in multiple computing environments.\n\nThe Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) is a highly mobile Airport Surveillance Radar and Precision Approach Radar system that provides Air Traffic Services at Army airfields and landing sites at Division, Corps, and Echelons above Corps to include services for Joint and Allied aircraft. ATNAVICS integrates capabilities to control aircraft both Outside of the Continental United States and in the Continental United States. ATNAVICS is upgrading the Interrogation Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF) system to maintain international airspace compatibility, capture flight information through the reception of aircraft self-reporting data broadcasts, and process into an interconnected air picture.\n\nThe Tactical Terminal Control System (TTCS) is a mobile ATC communications system that provides initial Air Traffic Services at remote landing sites and drop zones. It enables secure ground-to-air and ground-to-ground communications between Army aircraft, other services, Allied aircraft, and ground stations. TTCS provides aircraft separation and ground control capabilities, a meteorological measuring system for basic weather information, and Blue Force Tracker which provides near real time situational awareness and precision location capability."

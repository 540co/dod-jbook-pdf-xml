MPE enables the US Department of Defense (DoD) to execute its assigned\nmissions with mission partners across all phases of operations to assist combined command and control (C2) of coalition forces while meeting the information sharing requirements within existing bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements. Also, it promotes effective information exchange and provides applications to enable effective use of the US and Partner nation military power. MPE provides the warfighter mission with technology to improve mission effectiveness and cyber security.\n\nDirective-type Memorandum (DTM) 19-002 transferred the MPE capabilities of the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), Pegasus, the All Partners Access Network (APAN), the Combined Federal Battle Labs Network (CFBLNet) and three Virtual Data Centers (VDC), previously referred to as MPE Information Systems, to the USAF as the DoD Executive Agent for MPE. This effort increases combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners. FY2021 funding procures hardware and software to support the rationalization, consolidation and modernization of a common mission network capability that supports operations with the MPE.\n\nThis funding supports the testing, integration, and delivery of procedures, workstations, switches, servers, cross-domain services, communications infrastructure, video teleconference suites, network equipment, storage and backup, encryption equipment, software licenses, infrastructure, deployable suites and software communications. Variations in quantity and unit price reflect planned capital investment.  This funding further supports Coalition Interoperability Assurance and Validation (CIAV) technical, analytical, and engineering support to resolve C2 interoperability challenges and evaluate existing and emerging cyber capabilities and the development of the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) in support of the MPE ecosystem.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

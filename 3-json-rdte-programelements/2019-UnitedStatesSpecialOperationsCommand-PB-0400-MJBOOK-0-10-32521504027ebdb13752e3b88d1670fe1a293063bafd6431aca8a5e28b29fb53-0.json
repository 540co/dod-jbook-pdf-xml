Continue pursuit of methods to reduce operator load and provide advanced protection.  Develop technologies for improved and widened window of target engagement (escalation of force), pursue enhancements to technologies that can aid in detection of enemy intentions and movement, and continue development and exploration across the electromagnetic spectrum.  Based upon agreed technology maturity metrics, transfer successful projects into programs of record.  Continue the integration of critical technologies focused on providing the dismounted special operator leap-ahead capabilities via innovative collaborative processes.

The DoD ATEA is responsible for developing and enforcing AT policy and guidance, assessing AT technologies (hardware and software), maintaining and developing new AT technology assessment capabilities, maintaining and maturing AT laboratory equipment and infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a library of AT technologies, providing security guidance and support mechanisms, providing outreach and education to the DoD AT community, providing intelligence support, and evaluating AT implementations across all DoD acquisition programs, foreign military sales, and direct commercial sales. The AF OPR for AT evaluates AT on applicable AF acquisition programs, FMS, and DCS as well as manages AF AT technology development.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Anti-Tamper Executive Agent weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nAT protects critical program information (CPI) in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands on the battlefield. AT protections permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage and the combat capabilities of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters' mission requirements. Furthermore, AT adds longevity to DoD weapon systems and critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against the system or system component. \n\nAll DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation on all DoD Weapon Systems, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government off the shelf products. As technology advances, AT continues to perform AT hardware\/software assessment capabilities. These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and\/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and\/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.\n\nThe DoD ATEA coordinates technology development among the DoD Services\/Agencies, National Laboratories, and Industry. The DoD ATEA technology development strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology development across the Services which fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) and facilitate transition for programs to implement. The AT technology development and enhancement efforts include: advanced AT sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, modifying and developing technology to address vulnerability and susceptibility of fielded parts, and other AT enablers. \n\nThe Air Force AT OPR conducts Anti-Tamper technology development to meet Air Force service needs to mature promising AT technologies to transition to Air Force weapons systems. Technology development priorities are given to those technologies that most benefit AF acquisition programs.  These activities are coordinated through the ATEA as a part of the ATEA technology development roadmap and to coordinate with Navy and Army AT technology development efforts.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Emerging research areas such as materials, cryptography and electronic circuits have the potential to bring new AT capabilities with increased processing power, reduced power draw, and smaller form factor.

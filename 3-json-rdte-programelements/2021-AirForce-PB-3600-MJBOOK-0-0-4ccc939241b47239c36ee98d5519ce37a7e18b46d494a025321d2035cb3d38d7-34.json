Based on existing technological capabilities, WAS detects\/tracks low, slow and other asymmetrical threats in the airspace and meet the user needs of sensing stressing airborne targets in complex environments with affordable sensors. The sensor outputs are incorporated into the Battle Control Systems-Fixed (BCS-F) air picture and utilized as the NORAD\/USNORTHCOM Command and Control (C2) air surveillance system of record.\n\nAspects of the WAS program are classified and information will be provided on a need-to-know basis.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WAS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nThis exhibit, and the statement below, erroneously show development effort in Budget Activity 3 (project 834240).  The congressionally directed transfer of $20M RDT&E funding will be received and executed in Budget Activity 7 (project 675899) corresponding to operational system development.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

A subsequent task order was awarded (Jul 17) to include pre-operational site support. The CPFF contract for Scorpion was awarded (Aug 17) to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and testing of the Scorpion system, and conduct pre-operational site support. This strategy includes a single delivery approach with 11 STARS and 18 Scorpion systems for a total of 29  sub-systems delivered to achieve FOC. The pre-operational contract for the Scorpion system transitioned to Interim Contract Support (ICS) in Dec 2018, STARS system transitioned to ICS in June 2019.\n\nAir Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) DIGITAL (AFPEO DIGITAL) is the PEO for WAS.

The program integrates both defensive and offensive cyber research to develop interchangeable, defense-wide technology options to meet Combatant Command (CCMD) needs and requirements. To better align itself to the NDS, DoD Cyber Strategy, and Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)) Road to Dominance cyber initiative, the program recalibrated research thrust areas to pivot towards emphasizing a need for power projection and taking the fight to the adversary.

Judiciously exploring research under these thrust areas should provide a distinct advantage in future cyber conflicts.  Following a review and assessment of emerging joint operational needs, OUSD(R&E) developed four (4) research areas to enhance the DoD\u2019s tactical edge in a rapidly evolving cyber domain (described below):  \n\n\u2022 Behavioral Cyber Science:  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior by moving beyond binary electronic signals towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral science will increase the effectiveness of tools, increase the effectiveness of the cyber workforce, and improve the utility of cyber solutions.  Behavioral cyber science seeks to uncover details about how humans (represented by operators, users, adversaries, and\/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood, from a behavioral science standpoint, and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcomes.\n\n\u2022 Self-Securing Systems:  Prevailing in a contested cyber environment will require new sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity to protect the increasingly complex weapon systems and platforms that help DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Exploring foundational research in self-securing systems will arm future DoD systems with the capability to proactively, autonomously, and seamlessly assess cyber threats.  Additionally, future systems will be able to deploy self-defense mechanisms to neutralize cyber-attacks and enable blue forces to maneuver at will.  Autonomous cyber defenses will need to apply the most current advances in artificial intelligence research.\n\n\u2022 Precise Cyber Effects:  Precision offensive campaigns for the cyber domain require accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects to enable DoD leadership to achieve the desired outcomes from cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.  Exploring methods to derive quantifiable metrics will help improve the precision control of selecting cyber mission targets and raise the accuracy of effects; achieving an understanding of second and third order of effects will provide commanders with a higher confidence of success and limit collateral damage.\n\n\u2022 Applied Mathematics for Cyber:  Advancing mathematical foundations that are intrinsically linked to all branches of cyber science and technology, will cut across focus areas producing new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.  This area of research will characterize the cyber domain, maintain the integrity of data, harden systems, analyze potential solutions, and counter adversarial machine learning. \n\nAdvances in these cyber S&T areas will promote strong foundations, while disruptive innovations will create surprise, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas are critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cybersecurity beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense."

By focusing on higher risk research ideas with major potential impacts, the Cybersecurity program addresses one of the NDS\u2019s mission focus areas of cybersecurity.  The program works to advance the state of cybersecurity by judiciously exploring research in the areas of Behavioral Cyber Science; Self-Securing Systems; Precise Cyber Effects; and Applied Mathematics for Cyber.  These thrusts provide an opportunity to identify and advance foundational technologies to support all Services and Agencies.  \n\nResearch in Behavioral Cyber Science advances understanding and the technical rigor of modeling and predicting human responses to cyber activities that enhance cyber operations through planning, and training.  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior, moving beyond electronic signals (ones and zeroes) enables development of new insights to human behavior.  Exploring Self-Securing Systems, platforms, and networks will help DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Equipping future DoD systems with the capability to proactively, autonomously, and seamlessly access cyber threats and deploy self-securing mechanisms to neutralize cyber-attacks, offers blue force an innovative new disruptive capability.  Precise Cyber Effects provide scalable cyber options for military cyber commanders to precisely identify and engage specific threats and targets with a high confidence of success.  This high-risk research provides a disproportionate advantage in modeling cyber with high variability architectures for blue, gray, and red space that would potentially afford real opportunities.  Finally advancements in mathematical foundations of cyber cut across all three thrust areas producing new provable methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.  There is a need for an array of formal and informal modeling techniques, backed by various rigorous mathematical theories, to capture and support the richness of the cyber domain."

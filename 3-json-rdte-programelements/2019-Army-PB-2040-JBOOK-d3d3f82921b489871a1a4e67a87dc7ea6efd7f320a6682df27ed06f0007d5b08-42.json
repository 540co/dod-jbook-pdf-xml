            "val": "Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 in accordance with the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8).\n\nThe Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify\/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. EMARSS is assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, and include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT).\n\nThe Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is a RC-12X fixed-wing aircraft, which hosts Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) sensors. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify\/identify critical targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. In accordance with the Army's AISR 2020 strategy, the Army's Acquisition Objective\/Army's Procurement Objective (AAO\/APO) is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd MI BN; seven (7) fielded to the 204th MI BN, and five (5) pilot trainers to support Force Generation. The five (5) trainers are not equipped with Primary Mission Equipment (PME)."

EMARSS is assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four EMARSS-S (SIGINT). \n\nThis funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full Motion Video (FMV); Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar \/ Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI) radar; Line-Of-Site (LOS) and Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. \n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2019 funding in the amount of $6.531 million provides LiDAR Sensor Development and Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) and PED Sensor Engineering Support."

This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2019 Base funding of $1.980 million continues the lab and flight test for Signal 3 and 4 software to see if it meets the requirements in the ARL-E CPD.\n.\nFiscal Year (FY) 2019 OCO funding of $14.000 million continues the new signal enhancement development effort for Signal 3 and 4 to develop software to enhance the COMINT collection capabilities. This funding line supports continued software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters."

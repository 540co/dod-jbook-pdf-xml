This effort's focus is on the development of new\/novel antibiotics, especially those targeting the most resistant and worrisome Gram negative bacterial pathogens, using existing expertise at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and leveraging other WRAIR capabilities to evaluate viable candidate targets for advanced discovery. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities to respond rapidly and effectively to biological threats of international concern.\n\nThe cited work is also consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas, and supports the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases to include HIV."

Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nFY 2021 RDT&E resources are required to purchase mature production representative prototype components for operational demonstration evaluations, testing, and Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) characterization in support of Capability Set 23 in accordance with the Army approved ITN Abbreviated-Capability Development Document (A-CDD). \n\nThe Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program is a single Acquisition Category IC program encompassing: handheld radios (one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR),  two-channel Leader Radio (LR), and single-channel data radio) and Manpack (MP) radio (Generation 1 and Generation 2 radios). HMS provides voice and data communication to the expeditionary Warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS)\/Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radio systems are software reprogrammable, networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communication. HMS radios will support a variety of other platforms, including tactical End User Devices (EUD) voice and data needs. HMS provides tailorable and scalable, software-defined radio systems meeting U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs.\n\nTactical Network Radio Systems (Low-Tier) provide both Classified and Unclassified communications. The radios provide the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) legacy waveform for Classified and Unclassified communications. They also provide advanced waveforms (e.g. TrellisWare TSM) that provide Secure but Unclassified (SBU) communications. The MP radio provides the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) waveform for Tactical Satellite communications. The HMS program is currently in the process of conducting significant testing, including Laboratory and Field Based Risk Reduction events in support of an Operational Test event. \n\nThe HMS radio systems serve as the backbone of the ITN architecture, supporting a converged Mission Command network. This funding supports ITN testing and evaluation, of which HMS is a key component. The Army intends to test and integrate two-channel communication technologies, utilizing existing Army two-channel radio variants (MP Radios), in support of Air to Ground. A single-channel variant that runs an advanced networking waveform and Small Form Factors will be evaluated as part of the ITN as an affordable option to reduce size, weight, and power. This RDTE 6.5 funding line will involve mature system development, integration, and demonstration in support of ITN evaluation to include: concept refinement, characterization, data collection, demos, integrated testing, and operational assessments."

Following CT there was a Sandbox, Soldier Feedback Study, and Field \/ Lab Based Risk Reduction (FBRR\/LBRR) that serve as risk reduction events prior to Operational Test (OT) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers. The OT will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary \/ Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The OT will be designed to validate that HMS products meet warfighter needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment.

Utilizing a full and open competition strategy, the MP base contract was awarded to all potential industry partners. The MP contract was awarded on 26 February 2016, and procures NDI MP radios for use in a classified environment.  As laid out in the Acquisition Strategy, these candidate NDI radios will need to demonstrate through testing, compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; to obtain material release for Full Rate Production (FRP).  The MP is currently capable of running the following waveforms: Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) - Army managed waveforms, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) - Navy managed waveform, and other advanced networking waveforms. \n\nThe Army will procure radios through a multiple step selection process:\na. Awarded FFP Contracts to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (26 February 2016)\nb. Awarded initial delivery orders based on Qualification Test results (19 December 2016)\nc. Awarded second delivery orders based on Customer Test results (31 July 2017)\nd. Award(ed) LRIP delivery orders (30 April 2018, 06 June 2019, and 3QFY20)\ne. Achieve Full Rate Production (2QFY21)"

Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nFY 2021 RDT&E resources are required to purchase mature production representative prototype components for evaluation (lab and field based risk reduction events), testing, and Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) characterization in support of Capability Set 23 in accordance with the Army approved ITN Abbreviated-Capability Development Document (A-CDD). \n\nThe HMS handheld radios include the one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR), two-channel Leader Radio (LR), and single-channel data radio. Handheld radios provide voice\/data communication to the expeditionary Warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS)\/Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. Handheld radio systems are software reprogrammable, networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communication (RR\/LR). Handheld radios will support a variety of other platforms, including tactical End User Devices (EUD) voice and data needs. HMS provides tailorable and scalable, software-defined radio systems meeting U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs. \n\nHandheld radios provide both Classified and Unclassified communications. Handheld radios provide the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) legacy waveform for Classified and Unclassified communications. Handheld radios also provide advanced waveforms (e.g. TrellisWare TSM) that provide Secure but Unclassified (SBU) communications. The HMS program is currently in the process of conducting significant tests including Laboratory and Field Based Risk Reduction events in support of an Operational Test event. \n\nThe HMS radio systems serve as the backbone of the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) architecture, supporting a converged Mission Command network. This funding supports ITN testing and evaluation, of which HMS is a key component. A single-channel variant that runs an advanced networking waveform and Small Form Factors will be evaluated as part of the ITN as an affordable option to reduce size, weight, and power. This RDTE 6.5 funding line will involve mature system development, integration, and demonstration in support of ITN evaluation to include: concept refinement, characterization, data collection, demos, integrated testing, and operational assessments."

An acquisition strategy addendum adding LR was approved in March 2017. The addendum continued the multi-vendor approach utilizing the existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) RR base contract (awarded 29 April 2015) to on-ramp LR capabilities (18 September 2018). The LR effort is a separate competition under the Handheld radio suite.  As laid out in the acquisition strategy, these candidate non-developmental radios will need to demonstrate through testing, compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; to obtain material release for Full Rate Production (FRP).  \n\nThe LR will simultaneously run Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) and other advanced networking waveforms, in one radio with both handheld and mounted configurations, for fixed and mobile sites.\n\nThe Army will procure radios through a multiple step selection process:\na. Awarded FFP Contracts to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (18 September 2018)\nb. Awarded LRIP delivery orders to support SFAB and ITN fieldings\/evaluations (18 September 2018)\nc. Award LRIP delivery orders based on results of the best value trade-off construct (2QFY20 & 4QFY20)\nd. Achieve Full Rate Production (2QFY21)"

This work includes the Future Naval Capabilities program, which provides technology solutions to known requirements, and often responds to cost, schedule and performance challenges in acquisition to accelerate capability delivery. \n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) 0603673N for FNC Advanced Technology Development have emerged from earlier research conducted in PE 0602750N for FNC Applied Research, and have transition funding commitments from the receiving acquisition Program of Record. Each effort in this PE is assessed and selected for its payoff to the naval warfighter, technological maturity and stakeholder commitment to deploy it to the Fleet\/Force.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and\/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system\/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This technology will allow pilots and aircrews to train effectively in a common, simulated operating environment. Flexible and interoperable learning continuum and performance aids will be developed, providing individual career management, skill classification, selection, automatic training content re-engineering, supervisor evaluations, and Fleet readiness tracking.  New machine learning algorithms will input training data from the lifelong learning record, and output a training model that is usable for adaptive training. The focus on ready relevant training will accelerate learning, reduce the decay of acquired skills, and provide readiness tracking of performance at an individual level."

Trial data will be analyzed to inform system updates and preparations for FY 2022 trials which will complete testing and evaluation. System dock-side testing and shipbuilder trials will be completed in FY 2021 to confirm system installation and function to complete ship Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) period.\n\nAvalanche:\n- Continue activity on Unmanned Underwater Vehicle persistence and infrastructure. The specific effort will involve the development and maturation of technologies for autonomous, non-wet, mateable-transfer of energy and data in support of long endurance missions for unmanned undersea vehicles and seabed warfare. It will also include the development of long endurance autonomy and hardware solutions for fixed and deployable energy sources and heterogeneous communication networks.  \n\nCompact Rapid Attack Weapon (CRAW) Upgrade:\n- This effort will continue the development of advanced ASW capability software and conduct in-water testing. It will also continue software and hardware modifications to enable integration with the host platform.

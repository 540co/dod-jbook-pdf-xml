            "val": "3030: A significant portion of the F\/A-18 and EA-18G airframe is believed to have additional inherent capability and a life extension may be possible for many portions of the airframe. The F\/A-18 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is assessing the structural and subsystem conditions of the F\/A-18 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft designed life limits to allow it to achieve Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) inventory requirements. Without SLAP and the follow on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), aircraft are retired from the USN inventory when a design service life metric is reached. RDTE funds will support aircraft teardown to validate SLAP analysis, identify unknown fatigue areas and assess the aircraft's material condition.\n\n3182: The T-45 aircraft structure is currently fatigue limited to 14,400 flight hours based on initial full-scale fatigue tests. This service life limit prevents the T-45 fleet from meeting Integrated Production Plan (IPP) past 2025. Studies demonstrate that the 14,400 flight hour service life can be extended, with a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), to 21,600 flight hours, which will support meeting IPP until 2035. A T-45 Structural Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) was completed in February 2012. In order for the T-45 to meet IPP until 2035, it is also necessary to assess the subsystems of the T-45 in their ability to remain viable.\n\nIn FY13 an initial subsystem assessment, based on the updated fleet aircraft usage spectrum and future predicted training missions of the T-45 aircraft, found 79 dispositions requiring further analysis, teardowns, age explorations, recertification and\/or testing .  The assessment of the subsystems that make up these 79 dispositions will address all critical subsystems required and their ability to maintain IPP\/NTR until 2035, analysis and studies will be conducted to outline improvements, assess manufacturing capabilities, prototype redesign and test of subsystems for trainer aircraft.\n \n3384: The MH-60 SLAP is assessing the primary aircraft structure and subsystem condition of the MH-60S fleet in order to assess the airframe's ability to meet its designed service life of 10,000 hours and to determine what efforts are necessary to extend the aircraft design life limits to allow it to meet Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) operational inventory requirements through FY 2035. Without SLAP, aircraft are retired from the USN inventory when design service life limits are reached directly impacting fleet surface warfare, mine countermeasures, search and rescue, and vertical replenishment operational capabilities. FY 2020 budget request funds the completion of external loads analysis, continuation of fatigue analysis, and development of initial dispositions for safety critical items.  This initial analysis, assessment and disposition will be further refined throughout the SLAP effort, augmented with specific system teardown, inspection and test, culminating in a follow-on SLEP recommendation, which will design and implement the solutions resulting from the SLAP findings.  \n\n9999: FY 2019 Congressional Add funds MH-60S analysis and development of the 401D engine; the procurement of MH-60 alignment, tail cone, and pylon fixtures to support SLAP analysis, development of engineering technical data, drawings\/models and associated lists from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in support of SLAP deep look inspections.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding request was increased by $1.668 million to add EA-18G SLAP tasking to the budget."

The goal of the F\/A-18 SLAP program is to identify critical structures and components that can achieve the extended service life limit goals. SLAP consists of structural investigations of the main landing gear, arresting hook and catapult back-up structures, vertical tails, wings and fuselage. A second effort is to evaluate the subsystem components (hydraulics, wiring, actuators, etc) to identify over and above inspections, overhaul intervals or replacement schedules to fly past design life limits. The current life limits for the F\/A-18 E\/F are 6,000 Flight Hours (FH), 2,250 catapults\/arrestments (Cat\/Traps) and 15,750 total landings. The F\/A-18 SLAP program of record states the SLAP goals as 12,000 FH, 3,500 Cat\/Traps and 22,500 total landings. The primary objective of F\/A-18 and EA-18G SLAP is to determine if the stated SLAP goals are feasible. An increase in total landings and flight hours would allow the F\/A-18 to meet CNO inventory requirements. The requirements are integrated with the Joint Strike Fighter planned introduction. This effort is required to be conducted for these airframes and subsystems to ascertain what actions and modifications must be taken to safely operate each system beyond its designed life until the targeted end of service life."

These efforts will provide the raw engineering data to develop aircraft modifications to extend total aircraft landings, Cat\/Traps, and FH.  The F\/A-18 and EA-18G SLAP Program consists of two major engineering efforts: the aircraft structural assessment and the aircraft subsystems assessment.  Both efforts are broken into multiple phases which develop tools and models, evaluate current aircraft usage, and develop concepts to extend aircraft life to meet CNO objectives.  The program will combine exploitation of complete structural fatigue testing and actual fleet usage with the expectation of extending the service life of the F\/A-18 aircraft.  Conducting both F\/A-18E\/F and EA-18G SLAP to study the aircraft lifetime will provide a better estimate of aircraft service life and a follow on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP)."

The goal of the T-45 SLAP program is to identify critical structures and components that can extend the aircraft designed service life to support IPP and Naval Flight Officer Training Requirements (NTR) until 2035. This initial subsystem assessment, based on the updated fleet aircraft usage spectrum and future predicted training missions of the T-45 aircraft, found 79 dispositions requiring further analysis, teardowns, age explorations, recertification and\/or testing . The assessment of the subsystems that make up these 79 dispositions will address all critical subsystems required and their ability to maintain IPP\/NTR until 2035, analysis and studies will be conducted to outline improvements, assess manufacturing capabilities, prototype redesign and test of subsystems for trainer aircraft. The current life limits for the T-45 is 14,400 Flight Hours (FH). The T-45 SLAP program of record states the SLAP goals is 21,600 FH. This effort is required to be conducted for these subsystems to ascertain what actions and modifications must be taken to safely operate each system beyond its designed life until the targeted end of service life."

The highest flight time MH-60S helicopters are expected to exceed the currently assumed design life limit of 10,000 flight hours in 2024, at which time as many as 30 aircraft per year could be downed without a SLAP and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). The MH-60S has experienced significant structural issues since Initial Operational Capability in August 2002, resulting in downed aircraft and additional inspections for the operational fleet. Similar issues could very well precede the 10,000 flight hour life limit, particularly without the insight provided by a SLAP effort commenced as soon as possible. The MH-60 SLAP is comprised of two distinct assessments: Fatigue Life Assessment (FLA), which will establish the fatigue life of the aircraft and air vehicle systems and Subsystem Life Assessment (SLA), which will determine subsystem components that are critical to safe flight and ground operations and identify safety risk and risk mitigation strategies for critical components.  FLA consists of structural investigations of the cockpit beams, main gearbox beams\/frames, upper deck, engine mount, lower tub, main landing gear, tail landing gear, cargo hook, transition splice and tie-down fittings\/structure, tailcone, tail gearbox, intermediate gearbox, stabilator, manufactured joints\/splices, and flight controls support structure. SLA will evaluate engines, rotor brake, hydraulic, flight controls, avionics components and infrastructure, etc., to identify over-and-above inspections, overhaul intervals or replacement schedules to fly beyond the current design limit assumption.  \n\nFY 2020 budget request funds the continuation of external loads analysis, fatigue analysis, and development of initial dispositions for safety critical items.  This initial analysis, assessment and disposition will be further refined throughout the SLAP effort, augmented with specific system teardown, inspection and test, culminating in a follow-on SLEP, which will design and implement the solutions resulting from the SLAP findings."

Analyses from the SLAP efforts will provide the engineering data necessary to develop aircraft structural, component, and subsystem modifications to extend service life flight hour limits in order to avoid flight line inventory shortfalls. The MH-60S SLAP consists of two major engineering efforts: the FLA and the aircraft SLA.  These efforts are broken into multiple phases which develop tools and models, assess current aircraft usage, and develop concepts to extend aircraft life to meet Chief of Naval Operations objectives. The program will combine exploitation of aircraft deep look inspections and actual historical fleet usage. Conducting MH-60S SLAP to study the aircraft lifetime will define aircraft service life and is required to determine scope of the future follow-on SLEP."

During the FLA External Loads Analysis (FY 2018-2019), external loads for all fatigue conditions are identified from the three usage spectra. During the FLA (FY 2018-FY 2022), the fatigue assessment results and calculated fatigue lives are documented and areas for future improvements to extend the aircraft service life are identified.  During the FLA Structural Analysis (FY 2020-FY 2022), static fail-safety analyses of specific airframe sites are conducted to substantiate continued safe flight and identify areas for future service life extensions. Subsystems Phase A utilizes an interdisciplinary team within the USN tasked to develop a methodology for service life assessment of safety critical subsystems.  The resulting methodology will be based on a risk-focused approach that evaluates subsystems for potential safety critical failure modes, analyzes the associated hardware for age-related risk factors, and develops data-gathering or risk reduction dispositions.  Subsystem SLAP Phase B is initiated concurrently with the FLA.  During Subsystems SLAP Phase B (FY 2018-FY 2019), analytical service life risk assessments of aircraft subsystems are conducted and initial dispositions for safety-critical items are developed. During Subsystems SLAP Phase C (FY 2020-FY 2023), dispositions of Phase B are executed by performing component tests, aircraft inspections, and assembly teardowns.  Additionally, SLAP assessments are continued on components needing further investigation.  Subsystem SLAP Phase C is defined as the execution of the disposition decision resulting from Phase B efforts and will include the performance of component tests, aircraft inspections, component level fatigue analysis, and assembly teardowns.  During this Phase, Phase B dispositions will be refined for safety critical components based on new data."

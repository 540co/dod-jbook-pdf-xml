            "val": "This program develops, integrates, and demonstrates space technologies in the areas of spacecraft payloads, spacecraft protection, spacecraft vehicles, and space systems survivability. The integrated space technologies are demonstrated by component or system level tests on the ground or in flight. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n \nIn FY 2021, Project 633834, Integrated Space Technology Demonstrations, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603401F, Advanced Spacecraft Technology to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo. Navigation Technology Satellite-3 (NTS-3) Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603401F, Advanced Spacecraft Technology to the PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63682J, Spacecraft Vehicles, will be transferred from PE 0603401F, Advanced Spacecraft Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo.\n\nFor FY 2021 and future years, efforts and activities under Project 632181, Spacecraft Payloads; Project 634400, Space Systems Protection; and Project 635021, Space Systems Survivability, have been postponed\/curtailed due to higher Air Force, Space Force, and Department of Defense priorities.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continued to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Technology Directorate located in Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 0602298F, and 1206601SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

Future improved space-qualifiable electronics and software for data and signal processing will be more interchangeable, interoperable, and standardized. In the near-term, this project's work concentrates on converting (for example, radiation-hardening) commercial data and signal processor technologies for use in Air Force space systems. For mid-term applications, this project merges advanced, radiation-hardened space processor, memory, and interconnect technologies with commercially-derived, open system architectures to develop and demonstrate robust, on-board processing capabilities for 21st century Department of Defense satellites. In the long-term, this project area focuses on developing low-cost, easily modifiable software and hardware architectures for fully autonomous constellations of intelligent satellites capable of performing all mission related functions without operator intervention.\n\nIn FY 2021 and future years, the efforts and activities under Project 632181, Spacecraft Payloads, have been postponed\/curtailed due to higher Air Force, Space Force, and Department of Defense priorities."

Continue space segment components and sub-systems development with a focus on breadboard test and verification results for next generation navigation test satellites. Continue payload and user equipment development and complete user equipment and system software compatibility review to support a projected FY 2023 launch.  Conduct on-orbit demonstration of a Geosynchronous orbit small satellite extending the maturity of multiple communication technologies and operational concepts for future small satellites.  Continue on-orbit demonstrations of multiple formation flying satellites for near autonomous formation control.  Leverage opportunities to fly demonstrations and prototypes, where successes can identify quick transition to next generation technology needs.  Coordinate a manifest timeline for critical space projects prioritizing Air Force Space Command technical, security, and operational development requirements.

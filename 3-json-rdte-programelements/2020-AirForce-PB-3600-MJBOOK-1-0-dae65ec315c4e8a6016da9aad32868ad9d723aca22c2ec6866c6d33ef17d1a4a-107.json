Modernization includes alteration of facilities to implement a new, higher standard (including regulatory changes), to accommodate new functions, or to replace building components that typically last more than 50 years (such as foundations and structural components).  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.   These restoration\/modernization funds support the following Air Force test organizations and their associated test and evaluation facilities, including:  remote locations, the 96th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, including AEDC's 704th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, 704 TG Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, AEDC's Hypersonic Wind Tunnel 9 at White Oak, MD, AEDC's National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, CA, AEDC's McKinley Climatic Lab (MCL) at Eglin AFB, FL, and the 412th TW at Edwards AFB, CA.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

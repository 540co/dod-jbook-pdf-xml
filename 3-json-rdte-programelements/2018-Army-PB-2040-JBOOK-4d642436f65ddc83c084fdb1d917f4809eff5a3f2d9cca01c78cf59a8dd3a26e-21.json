These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.

            "val": "This program element funds the development of constructive and wargame simulations used to realistically train commanders and their battle staffs on today's complex battlefield conditions. \n\nProject 361 funds the development of the Intelligence Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT). IEWTPT is a Non-System Training Device (NSTD) which supports intelligence soldier readiness by simulating and stimulating Military Intelligence (MI) organic or surrogate equipment. It enables sustainment of critical individual and collective tasks\/skills and is the core of the United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoEs) Military Intelligence (MI) holistic training strategy and includes both stand-alone and network enabled training capabilities. IEWTPT provides a realistic Intelligence target environment for Multi-Intelligence disciplines such as All Source Analysis, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Counterintelligence (CI), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and must stimulate and emulate multiple Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platform systems such as: Prophet, Distributed Common Ground Station-Army (DCGS-A); Tactical Ground Station (TGS); and Aerial Intelligence assets such as Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced (ARL-E), and Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS). IEWTPT provides training capabilities supporting detailed ISR individual, crew, and collective level mission rehearsals\/exercises. IEWTPT can utilize a constructive simulation feed or operate in a stand-alone mode. IEWTPT is composed of two major components: Technical Control Cell (TCC) and the HUMINT Control Cell (HCC). The IEWTPT TCC provides critical Intel enhancements to a constructive simulation to stimulate go-to-war or surrogate ISR systems where system operators\/analysts are able to exploit exercise intelligence data during training, just as they would in a \"real world\" operation.\n\nFY 2020 funding supports U.S. Army readiness by developing interface capabilities with Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platform programs\/systems of records to train detailed military intelligence mission essential tasks in a simulation environment.  The funds provide the development of web-enabled capabilities and common operating environment\/computing environment (COE\/CE) migration for Command Post, Sensor, and Cloud requirements for both Human Control Cell (HCC) and Technical Control Cell (TCC).\n\nProject 362, Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) supports Army Title X training worldwide for Army Commanders and their staff at Mission Training Complexes (MTCs), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) facilities, and other customer locations. JLCCTC trains Commanders and their staff in Decisive Actions to include offensive, defensive, stability, and civil support operations. JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to Army Training Mission Area by providing appropriate levels of model and simulation resolution and fidelity to support unit collective and combined arms training. The JLCCTC provides a composable federation configurable to any combination of models and simulations, as required by training exercise intent\/design. The JLCCTC provides accurate representations of tactically and operationally relevant land warfare operations executed in a contemporary Joint operating environment\/context in support of Army Training and Readiness.\n\nFY 2020 funding in the amount of $8.610 million will be used to continue development, integration and test, and verification and validation activities of JLCCTC Version 9.x\/10.0 to train Commanders and their Staff.  JLCCTC will continue to support emerging Common Operating Environment \/ Computing Environment (COE\/CE), Mission Command (MC), Cyber Security\/Risk Management Framework (RMF), and Concurrency warfighter requirements.  In addition, JLCCTC will continue to support the integration activities with Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) and Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS)."

JLCCTC trains Commanders and their staff in Decisive Actions to include offensive, defensive, stability, and civil support operations. JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to Army Training Mission Area by providing appropriate levels of modeling and simulation resolution and fidelity to support unit collective and combined arms training. JLCCTC provides a composable federation configurable to any combination of models and simulations, as required by training exercise intent\/design. JLCCTC provides accurate representations of tactically and operationally relevant land warfare operations executed in a contemporary Joint operating environment\/context and in support of Army Training and Readiness.\n\nFY 2020 funding in the amount of $8.610 million will be used to continue development, integration and test, and verification and validation activities of JLCCTC Version 9.0\/9x to train Commanders and their Staff.  JLCCTC will continue to support emerging Common Operating Environment \/ Computing Environment (COE\/CE), Mission Command (MC), Cyber Security\/Risk Management Framework (RMF), and Concurrency warfighter requirements.  In addition, JLCCTC will continue to support the integration activities with Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) and Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS)."

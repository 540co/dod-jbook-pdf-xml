Currently, the Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCIIT) Enterprise is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community\nusers vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. This minority stake and the physical and organizational separation of CCMD users limits their ability to influence the development and delivery of services, or results in poorly sustained one-off, vice enduring enterprise-wide, solutions. Beginning in late 2014, the CCMDs requested the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) and the Joint Staff address longstanding gaps in their intelligence IT capabilities to\nsupport planning and operations. In response, OUSD(I) and Joint Staff\/J2 sponsored an effort to document the required capabilities and chronic shortfalls, and to validate these requirements through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The initial Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) for the CCIIT Enterprise was completed in February 2016, and an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) was approved by the JROC in September 2016. In November 2016, USD(I) requested the Secretary of the Air Force, Administrative Assistant (SAF\/AA) establish a Provisional Program Activity Office (PPAO) for CCIIT, to\nadvocate for materiel and non-materiel solutions for these validated requirements. Through FY2017, the CCIIT PPAO has actively engaged with the CCMDs and service providers throughout DoD and the IC to refine requirements, identify potential solutions, produce an integrated baseline Enterprise Architecture, and align and integrate capabilities across the enterprise critical to the warfighter."

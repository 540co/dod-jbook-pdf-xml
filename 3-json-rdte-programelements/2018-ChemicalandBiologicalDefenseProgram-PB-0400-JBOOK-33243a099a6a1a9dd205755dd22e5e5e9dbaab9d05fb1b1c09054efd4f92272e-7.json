Funding increases the Collective Protection System Backfit program M98 filter set life extension, and identifies and tests replacements for obsolete M93 Gas Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU) components used in numerous hard shelter systems.  The M93 GPFU improvements also address current electromagnetic interference requirements.  \n\nJECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  A family of systems, developed in two phases, that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  Phase 1 includes standalone CP systems and kits to provide existing host platforms and structures with CBRN protection.  Phase 2 includes kits to provide other host platforms and structures that were not explicitly designed in Phase 1.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination.  Funding will develop a field leakage test capability that allows Warfighters to validate the integrity of JECP and other fielded collective protection systems, integrate newly developed filtration material into existing M98 Gas Particulate Filter Sets to provide the Warfighter with improved protection against toxic industrial chemicals and toxic industrial materials while maintaining current performance characteristics against Chemical Warfare Agents and meeting military standards, develop a CP kit for non-CP environmental control units and improve on the current tent liner restraint systems."

Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.   The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.\n\nJOINT EXPEDITIONARY COLLECTIVE PROTECTION (JECP)\n\nStrategy based on evolutionary development, based on a family of systems approach.  After MS B, awarded competitive Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to Science Applications International Corporation (now Leidos) in 2008 to build prototypes subjected to robust engineering developmental testing and Operational Assessment during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  After MS C, awarded a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) option to Leidos in September 2013 for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems to support formal Developmental Testing (DT) and Multi-Service Operational Test & Evaluation (MOT&E) events.  In addition, a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) option was awarded to Leidos in January 2014 to perform non-recurring engineering (NRE) and logistic product development associated with the LRIP system configurations.  A post MS C Milestone Decision Authority Acquisition Decision Memorandum, dated March 2014, separated the program into two phases.  Phase 2 systems will be developed as engineering changes to Phase 1 systems.  The Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for Phase 1 systems, dated December 2016, addressed business case analysis results and approved a full and open competition build-to-print production task order under the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition, and Production\/Procurement Contract.  Phase 2 systems will undergo limited developmental and operational testing and then pursue a MS C full rate production decision.  BA7 funding develops incremental improvements to fielded JECP variants."

There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN on both contracts that allow for filter development tasks to be awarded.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or awarded to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system\/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system \"mission proven\" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  In addition to the maturing of the technology, the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of the media and the layered bed design requires maturing to an MRL level 9.  The complexity of maturing all these different items requires an evolutionary approach with one prototype iteration governing the approach on the next iteration.  With the criticality of the filter, the production transition to the new improved filter has to be done with a high degree of confidence with risks mitigated to a low level."

Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.\n\nEfforts included in this project are: (1)  the Biosurveillance Portal (BSP); (2) the Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Information Systems (CBRN IS); (3) the Joint Effects Model (JEM); (4) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (5) the Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nCBRN IS aligns Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO CBD) information technology in order to utilize a common software architecture, eliminate duplicative integration effort, produce interoperable system components, and minimize time-to-market of end user capability.  JPEO CBD information technology is assembled from the inventory of available capability in place of the current paradigm where functionality only exists within the individual Joint Effects Model (JEM), Joint Warning and Report Network (JWARN), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) applications.  CBRN IS aligns with the Joint Information Environment (JIE), such as milCloud, in order to field the integrated capabilities.  The JIE is the cornerstone of the DoD's future - providing a secure information framework from our national senior leaders and joint force commanders, command and control forces that deliver responsive, decisive actions from any device; anytime and anywhere.\n\nJEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Information Technology Box (IT Box) construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The \"IT Box\" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document released early in the program.  \"Agile Software Development\" is a set of industry standard software development methods used in conjunction with the IT Box framework.  Agile Software Development promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  The Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional program management, typically used in software development.  It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints.  Agile methodologies are an alternative to waterfall, or traditional sequential development. \n\nIT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort. \n\nThe Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) was a FY 2016 new start program to address USSOCOM requirements contained in an approved Information Systems Capability\nDevelopment Document (IS CDD). BSP is a web-based enterprise environment that will facilitate collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of\nthe detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events. BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance\ndomain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early\nidentification and response to biological events. BSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental\nofficers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force. BSP\ndoes not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a\ncentralized \"one-stop shop\" for all of their biosurveillance resources.\n\nThe BSP Program will utilize BA5 funding to execute the development, testing and evaluation of capabilities to meet the defined program requirements. There will\nbe two Production CDs and two Engineering Drops in FY17. CDs will be evaluated following Developmental Testing (DT) through End-to-End Testing using Users\nto validate delivered capability as part of the IT Box process thus reducing risk to the program and ensure a quality product is delivered to the Warfighter.\n\nAs software-intensive systems, JEM, JWARN, and BSP have no separately identifiable unit production components.  BSP, JEM, and JWARN are designated as ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost\/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC\/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.  \n\nThe Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity\/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management\/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies\/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information."

                            "val": "BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)\n\nThe Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) program will continue to meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014. The BSP program will utilize the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for program requirements, management, and development. The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach. IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event. Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs). There are two planned Production\nCapability Drops and two Engineering Capability Drops planned in each FY. Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD to verify capabilities prior to delivery to the Warfighter. User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to elicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in July 2016. A Full Operational Test & Evaluation will be conducted prior to Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20.\n\nCBRN INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\nCBRN IS utilizes the agile construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to scan the programs within the JPEO CBD, DTRA, and other sources for IT assets that can be hosted in a cloud environment and provide a CBRN capability for the warfighter.  Once a program has been identified for integration into CBRN IS, an evaluation will occur in order to see if any changes are necessary.  Modifications will be completed in coordination with the developer of the capability in order to be in alignment with CBRN IS guidelines.\n\nJOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)\n\nJEM Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.\n\nIT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.\n\nAs part of this strategy a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. \n\nThe current contractor for JEM Increment 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 \/ CD 2.1 documents. It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion. The follow-on contract in FY17 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract. The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.\n\nAn over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in Q4 FY14, and a CD1.1 Fielding Decision and a RDP-2 Build Decision were approved in Q3 FY16. Each subsequent RDP will have an single Build Decision and each CD will have an associated Fielding Decision.\n\nJOINT WARNING & REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)\n\nJWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  \n\nIT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.

These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.\n\nThe JWARN Program will find an appropriate Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).\n\nSOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)\n\nThe SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services."

By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011. JBAIDS efforts in FY18 will oversee the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of annual software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software, monitoring analyzer\/laptop parts obsolescence, and development of pre-emergency use authorization (EUA) packages for FDA review.\n\nThe NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease identification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment as defined in the approved NGDS Capabilities Development Document (COD) and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance as defined in the Common Analytical Laboratory (CALS) COD. NGDS Increment 1 will significantly improve diagnostic capability for deployable combat health support units (Role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests. The NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C   Limited Deployment acquisition strategy. BA7 will be used to complete the development of assays initiated during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase and needed for JBAIDS replacement as well as fund the development of three objective assays (Burkholderia, Alpha Virus, and Orthopox)."

JBAIDS also has pre-positioned Emergency Use Authorizations assays for the identification of low probability, high consequence pathogens in clinical samples that can be deployed in the event of a declared health emergency.  The program plans to conduct the annual JBAIDS Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) software compliance certification in addition to any logistics sustainment issues associated with parts obsolescence.  The JBAIDS program will begin to prepare for the Risk Management Framework processes for FY16 information assurance.  Additionally, the JBAIDS program office continues to partner with the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), other DoD and US Government laboratories to develop FDA Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages for biological warfare agents (BWA's) that could be used as biological warfare threats to DoD military forces.\n\nNEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)\n\nThe NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy. The NGDS Increment 1 is intended to replace the legacy\nJoint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. \n\nThe NGDS Increment 2 program addresses CBRN agents and concepts of employment (COEs) that the NGDS Increment 1 Film Array does not address. More than one materiel solution is required to expand the scope of CBRN agent diagnostics across multiple echelons of care. NGDS Increment 2 will employ a system of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, complementary bench top diagnostics, chemical diagnostics, and handheld disposable diagnostics. NGDS Increment 2 will initiate engineering development of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY17, while continuing to conduct risk reduction efforts for the other capabilities.  Separate decisions will be utilized  to establish programs of record for bench top, chemical and handheld disposable diagnostic capability development, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements."

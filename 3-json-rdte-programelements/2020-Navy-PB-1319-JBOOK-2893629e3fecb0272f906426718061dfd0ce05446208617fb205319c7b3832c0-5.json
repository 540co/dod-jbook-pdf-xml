        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The Advanced Combat System Technology line is to evolve the technical and business practices for programs to change to an open architecture construct. The program was constructed to mature both technical and business model integration for C5I systems programs of record in an open architecture environment. The priority was incorporating the principles of modular design and design disclosure, reusable application software, interoperability and secure information exchange, lifecycle affordability and encouraging competition and collaboration.\n\nProject Unit 0324: Funding is to fully implement the Naval Open (Systems) Architecture (OSA) strategy. The implementation of this strategy provides the tools and leadership for assisting programs and the Naval Research and Development Establishment through the technical, business and cultural transition to OSA. The primary tools and assistance is established through a limited set of technical reference frameworks, consistent contract language guidance, Intellectual Property strategies and improvements in transparency of design disclosure and information exchange on past and current investments to support portfolio management and cross-program reuse. The OSA transformation effort will be applied to programs of record and coupled with rapid prototyping efforts being realized as management efficiencies both within programs and in accelerated acquisition efforts. Those elements include ensuring that all naval systems, families of systems, programs and prototypes move to modular OSA in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.01 of 7 January 2015 which mandates that all DoD programs utilize Modular OSA to rapidly field affordable and interoperable systems. This project facilitates a strategic shift in the technical and business methods to establish cooperation and cross-domain\/COI business relationships. This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps. This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach, supported the development of open systems technologies, and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition. Naval OSA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function, capacity, and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements. This also includes the identification and development of common software components, functions, reuse methodologies, and extensible product lines.\n\nProject Unit 2480: The efforts described in this mission area address the advanced component development and prototype demonstration associated with the Navy's Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program and the Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments. The SSL-TM program is developing an integrated Laser Weapons System Demonstrator (LWSD). SSL-TM will provide a new capability to the Fleet to address known capability gaps against asymmetric threats (UAS, small boats, and ISR sensors) and will inform future acquisition strategies, system designs, integration architectures, and fielding plans for laser weapon systems. \n\nProject Unit 3422: The SHARC Surface Platforms demonstration project is part of the Department of Defense Third Offset Strategy as one element in the Sensor Grid category for 24\/7 autonomy infused Situational Awareness (SA). This project will purchase Commercial-off-the-Shelf SHARC Platforms (wave gliders) and integrate four (4) unique Government-owned classified mission payloads focused on the detection of threats. These capabilities will enable CONOPS development in an operationally relevant environment to demonstrate how these technologies can improve the SA to the battlespace Commanders.\n\nProject Unit 3423: The LOCUST demonstration is part of the Department of Defense Third Offset Strategy as one element in the Effector Grid category for small autonomous systems. LOCUST leverages the BA-3 Innovative Naval Prototype program developing and demonstrating swarming technology. The BA-3 effort is developing both the air vehicle, UAS swarming behaviors, and miniaturized sensor systems. ONR has demonstrated an autonomous system capable of launching 33 UASs in 40 seconds and flying them in a coordinated swarm. This BA-4 effort is trailing the BA-3 demonstration of technologies by a fiscal quarter and then demonstrating the technology in operationally relevant environments with military mission applications.\n\nProject Unit 3424: The Heterogeneous Collaborative Unmanned Systems (HCUS) demonstration is part of the Department of Defense Third Offset Strategy as one element in the Effector Grid category for small autonomous systems. HCUS provides autonomous, tactical monitoring of an adversary's port-sized littoral area for an extended period of time with capability to apply limited offensive effects on-demand.  Vehicles and sensors are intended to be used in contested environments - employing local communications nets, autonomous vehicle behavior, low bandwidth command links and local navigation with no requirement for GPS input. \n\nHCUS systems can be encapsulated and deployed as a single payload, or a small number of payload packages designed for specific missions. The payloads can be carried into theater by various manned or unmanned platforms depending on the degree of stealth required. A week-long project demonstration will simulate covert deployment, operations of autonomous UAVs over the area of interest, data exfiltration to a remote operator, autonomous UAV recharging via USVs and\/or UUVs, deployment of unmanned ground sensors for persistent sensing, and remote operator on-demand offensive attack on a simulated target.\n\nProject 3437: The EMW\/SEWIP\/SSEE Accelerator is part of the Department of Defense Third Offset Strategy to improve real time Electro-Magnetic Maneuver Warfare operations. This effort will develop integrated cross platform active and passive sensing solutions, next generation network and real time spectrum operations.\n\nProject 3438: This activity addresses the advanced component development and prototype demonstration associated with ONR's Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program and the Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments. INP and LA-Tech investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. INPs and LA-Techs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities. Investments may include such mission areas as Unmanned and Autonomous Systems, Directed Energy \/ Electric Weapons, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare, Cyber Warfare, and Undersea Warfare. Funding to be realigned from the Unmanned Rapid Prototype Development project (Project Number 0399) in FY 2019."

The implementation of this strategy provides the tools and leadership for assisting programs and the Naval Research and Development Establishment (NR&DE) through technical, business and policy transition to OSA. The primary tools and assistance are provided through a limited set of technical reference frameworks, consistent contract language guidance, Intellectual Property strategies and improvements in transparency of design disclosure and information exchange on past and current investments to support portfolio management and cross-program reuse. The OSA transformation effort will be applied to programs of record and coupled with rapid prototyping efforts being realized as management efficiencies both within programs and in accelerated acquisition efforts.  Those elements  include ensuring that all naval systems, families of systems, programs and prototypes move to modular OSA in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.01 of 7 January 2015 which mandates that all DoD programs utilize Modular Open Systems Architecture to rapidly field affordable and interoperable systems. This project facilitates a strategic shift in the technical and business methods to establish cooperation, cross-domain, and community of interest business relationships. This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps. This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach, supported the development of open systems technologies, and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition. Naval OSA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function, capacity, and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements. This also includes the identification and development of common software components, functions, reuse methodologies, and extensible product lines."

The SSL-TM program is developing an integrated Laser Weapons System Demonstrator (LWSD). SSL-TM will provide a new capability to the Fleet to address known capability gaps against asymmetric threats (UAS, small boats, and ISR sensors) and will inform future acquisition strategies, system designs, integration architectures, and fielding plans for laser weapon systems.  \n\nINP and LA-Tech investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. INPs and LA-Techs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities. Successful demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future. \n\nONR manages a continuum of INP and LA-Tech development from BA2 to BA3 to BA4. The goal of these BA4 investments is to further mature development and expend efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environments. This BA4 investment includes system specific efforts that help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Projects in this category involve efforts prior to Milestone B and are referred to as advanced component development activities and include technology demonstrations. It is the goal of these projects to achieve Technology Readiness Levels 6 or 7. Successful experimentation and demonstration highlights the viability of new technological capabilities that could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be established to support further development. The portfolio is periodically refreshed through the selection of new INPs and LA-Tech investments as existing ones are completed."

This project will purchase Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) SHARC Platforms (wave gliders) and integrate unique Government-owned classified mission payloads and enhanced capabilities including the detection of threats with persistence.  The focus of this effort is to accelerate demonstration of capabilities to meet Combatant Commander (COCOM) requirements that do not exist elsewhere in DoD and provide the fleet with a low cost, asymmetric advantage in support of multiple classified missions.  This includes persistent, autonomous situational awareness and early warning of submarines or related submarine activity as well as broad area, clandestine implementation of capabilities that enhance Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) and strike missions.  The successful demonstration of one particular payload integration to support a high priority warfighting mission area will be followed by a prototype operational event.  These capabilities will enable Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) development in an operationally relevant environment to demonstrate how these technologies can improve the SA to the battlespace Commanders."

ONR has demonstrated an autonomous system capable of launching 33 UASs in 40 seconds and flying them in a coordinated swarm. This BA-4 effort is trailing the BA-3 demonstration of technologies by a fiscal quarter and then demonstrating the technology in operationally relevant environments with military mission applications. Due to limitation of funding, FY 2018 accomplishments were limited to just the planned warfighter workshops and program planning.

HCUS provides autonomous, tactical monitoring of an adversary's port-sized littoral area for an extended period of time with capability to apply limited offensive effects on-demand.  Vehicles and sensors are intended to be used in contested environments - employing local communications nets, autonomous vehicle behavior, low bandwidth command links and local navigation with no requirement for GPS input. \n\nHCUS systems can be encapsulated and deployed as a single payload, or a small number of payload packages designed for specific missions. The payloads can be carried into theater by various manned or unmanned platforms depending on the degree of stealth required. A week-long project demonstration will simulate covert deployment, operations of autonomous UAVs over the area of interest, data exfiltration to a remote operator, autonomous UAV recharging via USVs and\/or UUVs, deployment of unmanned ground sensors for persistent sensing, and remote operator on-demand offensive attack on a simulated target."

The BA-3 effort is developing high speed sensor and electro-magnetic networking, real time spectrum operations and passive targeting technologies.  ONR has demonstrated elements of next generation networking, passive tracking, and cross platform combat system coordination.  This BA-4 effort is trailing the BA-3 demonstration of technologies deploying and demonstrating the technology in operationally relevant environments with military mission applications.  The deployment will allow the ONR to significantly reduce risk, incorporate early warfighter improvements and test with real world data and scenarios."

INP and LA-Tech investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. INPs and LA-Techs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities. Successful demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future. \n\nONR manages a continuum of INP and LA-Tech development from BA2 to BA3 to BA4. The goal of these BA4 investments is to further mature development and expend efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environments. This BA4 investment includes system specific efforts that help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Projects in this category involve efforts prior to Milestone B and are referred to as advanced component development activities and include technology demonstrations. It is the goal of these projects to achieve Technology Readiness Levels 6 or 7. Successful experimentation and demonstration highlights the viability of new technological capabilities that could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be established to support further development. The portfolio is periodically refreshed through the selection of new INPs and LA-Tech investments as existing ones are completed. \n\nINP, LA-Tech, and supporting technology investments may include R-2 Activities mission areas such as Unmanned and Autonomous Systems, Directed Energy \/ Electric Weapons, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare, Cyber Warfare, and Undersea Warfare."

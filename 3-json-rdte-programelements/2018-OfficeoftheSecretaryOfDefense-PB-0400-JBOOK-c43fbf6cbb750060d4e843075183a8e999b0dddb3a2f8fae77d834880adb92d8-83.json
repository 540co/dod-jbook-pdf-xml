            "val": "These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  The funding increase beginning in FY 2016 represents planned growth and internal reprogramming decisions to accelerate development of a cloud-enabled joint training environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n- Joint Simulation System (JSS)\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n- U.S. Forces Korea Training & Exercise Support (USFK)\n- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and SOF joint training and enabling capabilities that improve interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint collective training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. The enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program will focus efforts on improving, rather than consuming, readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  The JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO and multinational partners. The Joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS\u2019s intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners.\n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the JS J7 program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD T2 JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, and reporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, IA training; and OSD required training (externally funded).  JKO also expends funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance specific aspects of the training capability as required for J7 support to Combatant Commanders. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide the CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content.\n\nUSFK:  FY 2015 is the last year for dedicated funding within the overall program.  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training & Exercise Support program develops simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System (KSIMS) is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences -- tactical to strategic -- in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK\u2019s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.  \n\nAir Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based capabilities for integration into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements, and significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable the Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and Coalition Forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard."

Terrain Generation Services provides individual users' ability to request and receive simulation ready terrain for several simulations with plans to support more simulations.  Terrain Generation Service also provides the ability to layer content over standard geographic maps to enrich the standard information available on the map.\n\u2022  Completed the overarching and comprehensive data model supporting the new web-services based Joint Training Tool software architecture.\n\u2022Within a cloud construct, leveraged current technologies to lessen the burden of specific physical machines and allow quicker build and tear-down of systems through virtualization.  Explored public cloud offerings in alignment with the DoD Chief Information Officer's Cloud Computing Strategy."

Follow-on persistent prototype tactical sensor capabilities will be operational in FY 2021\/2022 and will be integrated with the Army Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) ground station to tactically task, receive and disseminate data to directly support live-fire S2S demonstrations and assessments.\nAll FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 633463 (Tag, Track and Locate). The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

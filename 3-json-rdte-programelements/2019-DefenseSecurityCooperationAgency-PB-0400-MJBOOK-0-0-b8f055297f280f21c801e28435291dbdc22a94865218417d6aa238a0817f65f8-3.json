New capabilities will include the ability for conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), and Military Department (MILDEP) stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD Common Access Card (CAC)\/ Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DOD agencies such as the Dept. of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user\u2019s organization is easily shared and accessible.  Further improvements will be accomplished on the Cross-Domain Solution (CDS), which will allow the transfer of data\/documents from Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) to the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet); the addition of four Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) which are a major component of G-TSCMIS data and reduce user re-entry resulting in a positive operational impact and higher quality of data -- i.e. completeness and accuracy; expansion of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which will facilitate dynamic creation and maintenance of access control policies, subject attributes, and resource attributes.\n\nAn increase of $6.589M from FY2017 to FY2018 is due to the required development contract award of the fourth release, Release 4.  New requirements resulted from the Joint Staff J6 Requirements Workshop in June 2015, National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 17 and NDAA 18 will added additional developmental efforts to future releases.  New capabilities will include the ability for assisting OSD Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development, conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD Cost Assessment and Performance Evaluation (CAPE), JS, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), CJCS, and MILDEP stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD CAC\/ PKI Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DoD agencies such as the Department of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user\u2019s organization is easily shared and accessible.

Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G- TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2020. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2, and fair and open competition for the Release 3 contract. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards. Release 4 will be completed by a separate contract which will be competed for under fair and open competition."

Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program. The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational. Additional statistics-based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&V and Developmental tests validate system performance.

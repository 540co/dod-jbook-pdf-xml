            "val": "This Program Element (PE) directly supports the development of innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats from the diverse range of state and non-state actors confronting the Unites States.  These capabilities include: space and terrestrial-based indications and warnings systems, integrated and resilient Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, strategic lift, long-range precision strike weapons, missile defense technologies, undersea systems, remotely operated vehicles and technologies, special operations forces, the Cyber Mission Force, ground systems, and others outlined in the 2015 National Military Strategy.  Analytic assessments are informed comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2015-2035 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas and help to support detailed analyses and assessments to inform and influence programmatic decisions regarding technology development and procurement plans.  The science and technology (S&T) analytic assessments performed under this budget item include the following activities:\n\n-  Technical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.\n-  Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development.\n-  Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability.\n-  Development of strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.\n-  Quantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies. \n\nDue to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases.  The emerging nature of the problem sets makes identification of studies beyond the budget year unlikely.  Typically, the ratios of resources applied to quick reaction studies, strategic analysis, and development of analytic tools will be roughly 30\/50\/20 percent.  The first step in the process is to quickly assess gaps and options to fill those gaps; second, produce detailed analysis quantifying key attributes of the challenge, assess options, and provide an operational value assessment; and finally, develop analytic tools to help understanding of complex and longer term challenges. Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year to year."

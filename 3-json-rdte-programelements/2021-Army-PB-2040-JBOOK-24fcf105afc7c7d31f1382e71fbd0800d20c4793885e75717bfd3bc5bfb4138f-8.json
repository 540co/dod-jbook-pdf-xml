            "val": "Program Element (PE) 0607137A Chinook Product Improvement Program is critical to achieving the Army's heavy lift Multi-Domain Operational capability.  With an increased payload and operational reach, the CH-47F Block II is the only platform that can lift the JLTV, M777 and medium girder bridge to enable Multi-Domain Forces to Compete, Penetrate, Disintegrate, and Exploit at operationally relevant distances.  \n\nThe CH-47F Block II acquisition program upgrades existing CH-47F aircraft and procures common hardware that exists between the CH-47F and MH-47G aircraft for Special Operations Forces.  The CH-47F Block II program provides additional capability to the field with greater reach, increased payload capability and an increase in maximum gross weight to 54,000 pounds.  These improvements are based on airframe and subcomponent changes.  Specifically, the Advanced Chinook Rotor Blades will increase lift in high-hot conditions while improved flight control and drive train components will both increase aircraft performance and reduce O&S costs.  The program updates the Common Avionics Architecture System and Digital Advanced Flight Control System systems of the aircraft and incorporates other avionics changes introduced into the final CH-47F production lots.  CH-47F Block II will also include a strengthened airframe which introduces commonality with the MH-47G and improvements to rotor, fuel, and electrical systems which will improve safety and reliability for the aircraft.  Along with providing a significantly increased capability to the field, the program includes provisions for anticipated future upgrades as well as weight and cost savings initiatives to ensure the Army has a platform with the flexibility and performance needed to meet the needs of Multi-Domain Operations until a Heavy Future Vertical Lift variant is fielded.\n\nThe Cargo Project Management Office awarded the CH-47F Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in July 2017.  The EMD phase will produce three production representative test articles to support a Milestone C decision in the 4th quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.  This phase will include contractor and government led system level qualification testing.  The contractor led system level qualification testing includes both ground and flight test.  The government led system level qualification testing includes Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3), Limited User Test (LUT) and aircraft subsystem Live-Fire Test and Evaluation (LFTE)."

It is capable of training mission tasks and emergency procedures and provides a cost savings when compared to using aircraft for these purposes.  The TFPS will increase safety and mitigate risk to Block II Limited User Test (LUT) aircrews by allowing pilots to train aircraft differences in modifications, handling qualities, performance and human factors considerations before actual flight is performed.  Training in the TFPS reduces LUT timelines and improves aircrew proficiency as confirmed in the CH-47F (Block I) Phase 2 User Test Report.  The initial Block II TFPS will also serve as building block for upgrading the fielded TFPSs to the Block II configuration."

Additional objectives of the Block II program include: efficiently incorporating multiple engineering changes, accomplishing required mid-life airframe recapitalization, converging the special operations and conventional Army designs, establishing a foundation for future block upgrades, and maintaining the industrial base until a Heavy FVL is realized.\n\nQuantity of RDT&E Articles:  \nFY 2018 - Awarded:  1  - Ground Test Vehicle (GTV), 2 - CH-47F Block II Prototypes\nFY 2019 - Awarded:  1 - CH-47F Block II Prototype \n\nFY 2019 - Scheduled Delivery: 1 - GTV, 2 - CH-47F Block II Prototypes\nFY 2020 - Scheduled Delivery: 1 - CH-47F Block II Prototype"

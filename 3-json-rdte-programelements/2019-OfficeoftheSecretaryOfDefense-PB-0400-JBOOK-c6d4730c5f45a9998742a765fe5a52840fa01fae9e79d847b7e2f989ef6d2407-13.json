Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. \n\nThe analysis process addresses the following Joint and Cross-Cutting missions: 1) Operational and Technical Assessments identify gaps and options to fill those gaps; 2) Technical Analysis quantifies key attributes of the challenge, assess counter technology options, and provide an operational value assessment; and 3) Development of Analytic Tools to help understand complex and longer term challenges. The Quick Reaction Analysis Team provides quick turn analysis on emerging challenges and senior leader issues using the Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC\/UARC) community as performers while leveraging previous related experience and work done for the Department of Defense (DoD). \n\nTypically, the ratios of resources applied to Operational and Technical Assessments, Technical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team, and development of Analytic Tools will be roughly 30\/60\/10 percent.  Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year to year. Throughout this process the analysis will be tightly coupled with both the Intelligence community and the operational community through the Combatant Commands."

Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. The emerging nature of the problem sets makes specific identification of all the study projects beyond the budget year unlikely. Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year-to-year.\n \nOperational and Technical Assessments are informed by comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2018-2038 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas. These products support detailed analyses and assessments to help shape technology investment decisions and inform the strategic direction of capability development Because of the 20 year timeframe, these analyses will also help to inform requirements rather than waiting for current processes to develop them. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n- KCA across Defense Planning Scenarios and other relevant DOD Vignette to identify and characterize capability disadvantages and opportunities across the battlespace. \n- Developed and maintain an all source-like database of military capabilities and a standalone software application, KCA Results Display System, to provide data and analysis on operational issues.\n- Produce operational impact assessments of potential technology improvements to military capabilities in the near, mid, and far term.\n- Consolidate Technology focused roadmaps of US capability development and S&T developmental strategic plans. \n\nTechnical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team perform engineering level systems analysis using the DoD sponsored FFRDC\/UARC and Department of Defense and Department of Energy (DoD\/DoE) laboratories. Using these research performers, previously sponsored research on relevant topics is leveraged in the new research providing value and experience on new projects. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-  Technical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.\n-  Quantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies. \n-  Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability.\n-  Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development.\nAnalytic Tools include modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A), computer based engineering models, and purposed designed equipment to demonstrate or confirm theoretical performance of technical concepts. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-  Develop analytic tools to inform and provide decision support to resourcing recommendations.\n-  Develop strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.\n-  Integrated MS&A leveraging Service- and Agency\u2013level virtual and constructive resources to provide insight into complex acquisition and operational decisions.\n-  Red Teaming existing and planned US capabilities and weapons systems using emerging threat systems and capabilities in emerging scenarios."

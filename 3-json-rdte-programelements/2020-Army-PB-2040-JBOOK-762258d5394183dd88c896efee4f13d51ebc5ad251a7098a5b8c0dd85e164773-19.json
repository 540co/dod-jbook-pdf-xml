            "val": "The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based, Combined Arms Training Strategy. The CATT program portfolio directly supports the Army's Training Strategy and progressive training model by providing realistic training events and comprehensive After Action Reviews (AAR). CATT enables units, from crew to the battalion task force level, to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic, interactive, synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and AAR for CATT expansions, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) supports combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, ground-air coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication, command, control, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT, units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises, as well as training tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment. Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions, CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces, CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training, and realistic simulation training in CATT, is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in combat operations.\n\nFY 2020 base funding of $9.241 million for SE Core will continue the development of the Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC) to ensure the process remains Army Geospatial Center (AGC) certified and that the terrain data maintains the \"Gold Standard\" quality and remain concurrent with supported training systems. FY 2020 funds will also continue the development and integration of new tools and processes to improve the STDGC to accommodate generation of increasing larger constructive terrain databases."

This gaming capability allows units and commanders to train individual and collective tasks at the company and below level with minimal amount of resourcing required (land, ammunition, transportation, etc.). Through the use of GFT systems, commanders are able to refine and rehearse unit Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) prior to executing live, large-scale training events. GFT trains higher echelon units and staffs by facilitating Tactical Exercises Without Troops (TEWT).  \n\nThe research and development efforts supporting the GFT program has completed, and the program will not request funding in FY 2020."

The GFT RMF compliant hardware system consists of a common desktop or laptop computer, headset, and peripherals; this hardware is configured as gaming suites and is fielded to 88 various Army locations. In support of its fielding efforts, the GFT program will acquire fielding support to provide logistical provisioning for the de-confliction and coordination with receiving locations as well as oversight for meeting network and cyber requirements. Additionally, program plans to acquire technical support to provide system monitoring of the GFT hardware and software configuration to ensure compliance with Army's RMF requirements.\n\nIn FY 2018, the GFT Program was directed to end the Program by FY 2024, due to the gaming requirement for training being provided by the Synthetic Training Environment (STE) starting in FY 2021. The GFT Program will meet Full Operational Capability (FOC) in FY 2019 (all 115 BOIP Cyber Compliant Classroom Suites will be installed). After FOC, there will be a Tech Refresh of previously fielded GFT Classroom Suites to bring them up to RMF compliance through FY 2021, followed by Sustainment beginning in FY 2022 and a Divestment Period beginning in FY 2023 and ending by FY 2024."

The SE Core Program is a foundational element and the only provider of correlated terrain for the Army's Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE) that links Army training systems and simulators into an integrated and interoperable environment.  SE Core's mission is to ensure that Army systems and simulators support U.S. Army Readiness by providing visual models (buildings and vehicles), terrain (over which the simulator moves), and entity behaviors (models performing realistic and appropriate actions such as movement and weapon effects) that are relevant and realistic to Force 2025 and beyond.  As the exclusive provider of correlated terrain, SE Core ensures that all Army simulators\/operators receive terrain that allows for a \"Fair Fight\" capability; that is, no one will have an inherent advantage over another because training did not occur on a \"level playing field\".  Fair Fight allows air and ground forces to hold coordinated and integrated training events that accurately replicate combat operations for a train-as-we-fight capability.  \n\nA major component of the program is the SE Core-developed Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC), the process used to build the terrain and models that the simulators and simulations employ.  The Army Geospatial Center (AGC) gave SE Core its highest rating, the \"Gold Standard\", based on the quality of the STDGC process and the geospatial data generated by it.  The program has been a certified, AGC co-producer of geospatial data since 2014.  In addition to the correlated terrain databases and common visual models, SE Core components include Virtual One Semi-Automated Forces (Virtual OneSAF) (the computer generated force behaviors for virtual systems); the virtual systems architecture; and mission command development. \n\nFY 2020 base funding of $9.241 million for SE Core will continue the development of the STDGC to ensure the process remains AGC certified and that the terrain data maintains the \"Gold Standard\" quality and remain concurrent with supported training systems. FY 2020 funds will also continue the development and integration of new tools and processes to improve the STDGC to accommodate generation of increasing larger constructive terrain databases."

The SE Core program is developing the software tools and processes to develop the Army's common virtual environment to link simulation devices [to include: Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), Aviation Close Combat tactical Trainer (AVCATT) , Games for Training (GFT), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Homestation Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC), Fires Simulation (FIRESIM), One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF)] into an interoperable environment and maintaining the synthetic terrain, models, and virtual OneSAF for the Army's Integrated Training Environment (ITE) concept.\n\nThe government awarded Increment 2 as a single award, cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Leidos in August 2011 with a period of performance start date of December 2011. Leidos was formerly known as Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). This contract has a one-year base with four one-year options. The government exercised the first option in December 2012, the second option in December 2013, the third option in December 2014 and the fourth option in December 2015. The government awarded a final delivery order in December 2016 that extended the period of performance of the Increment 2 contract into December 2017.  The contract was extended an additional six months to June 2018 while the Increment 3 contract was competed.\n\nIn April 2018, in keeping with the original SE Core acquisition strategy of continuous development, the government awarded the Increment 3 contract as a single award, CPFF, IDIQ with a one year base and four one-year options and a target end date of 2023."

The most recently awarded RDTE effort was on the fourth delivery order, awarded in September 2014, which included options for gunnery enhancements, integrated data modem development, training environment virtualization, aviation mission planning software development, maintenance tool kit development, manned unmanned teaming, and AH-64E concurrency development.\n\nThe government awarded a single award, CPFF, IDIQ services contract to Cole Engineering Services, Inc, a small business, in September 2015.  The period of performance of the base contract is through September 2020.   The third task order, awarded in June 2016, included hardware modernization development and Windows 10 research and testing.  \n\nAVCATT utilizes small business competitively awarded contract vehicles when able. Currently small businesses are conducting development for dynamic terrain enhancements, NCM3 development, and training effectiveness analysis.\n\nThe AVCATT program is post Milestone C. Although the system is in the production phase, continuous research, development, testing, and engineering is required in order to maintain concurrency with the real world aircraft and systems that the AVCATT simulates in the virtual training environment. The AVCATT program has fielded the full base order of issue of 23 suites but continues to release incremental hardware and software upgrades at approximate semiannual intervals.  RDTE efforts will not continue in FY 2020, as system begins its transition into sustainment."

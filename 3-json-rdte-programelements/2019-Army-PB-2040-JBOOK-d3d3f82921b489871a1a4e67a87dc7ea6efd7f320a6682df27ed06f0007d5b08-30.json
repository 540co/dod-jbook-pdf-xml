The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety, and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting, and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders. Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to continue to develop and modernize the system to meet requirements set forth by the DoD's Risk Management Framework (DoDI 8510.01) as well as the Defense Information Systems Agency's Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide. Prior to funding being committed, DoD ESOH stakeholders, authoritative information technology organizations, and the program's functional sponsor were consulted to determine necessary system interface upgrades to be incorporated. Expanding DENIX's architecture to create a Level 2 container separate from the current Level 4 container will not only provide a more secure, cybersecurity risk-adverse environment, but it will also optimize performance, capabilities, and mandatory reporting for ESOH stakeholders. This phased solution begins in FY 2018 by prototyping of system architecture optimization that improves user experience, enabling web conferencing in FY 2019 and applying machine learning concepts to improve data quality in FY 2020-2022."

The ICBM Dem\/Val program will provide technology maturation and risk reduction activities to support Minuteman (MM) III sustainment, MM III to GBSD transition, and future ICBM systems (non-GBSD) development. Efforts will identify methods to improve system performance, mitigate evolving threats, reduce life cycle costs, improve nuclear safety and surety, and ensure both viability and endurability of strategic missile systems. This program also includes any needed nuclear surety and certification and system vulnerability assessments.\n\nBA4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

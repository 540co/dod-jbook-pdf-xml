CON-IT will enable strategic sourcing and other acquisition efficiencies by standardizing data, business rules, and milestone tracking. Furthermore, CON-IT will allow for a standardized and integrated method of anticipating, reacting, and responding to the current pace and changes in process, regulation, and technology across the contract domain. CON-IT is the replacement for the AF's version of Standard Procurement System (SPS). When fully implemented, CON-IT will enable business process changes necessary to converge on a common contract writing\/management capability within the Air Force.\n\nCON-IT capabilities will be developed in accordance with the agile software development methodology. The CON-IT Integrated Program Office (IPO) will configure upon the Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA's) government off-the-shelf (GOTS) product called Integrated Defense Enterprise Acquisition System (IDEAS) contract writing system, which provided a solution that serves as a baseline for CON-IT. CON-IT will utilize a non-traditional acquisition approach by leveraging DISA IDEAS as well as partnering with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Enterprise Application Services (EAS) team via an inter-agency agreement to develop, test, validate, train end users, deploy, and maintain CON-IT. USDA's National Information Technology Center (NITC) will provide and maintain the DevSecOps and production environments.\n\nGap requirements will be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced and made available to operational users after every sprint. The IPO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.\n\nThrough agile software development CON-IT will address the current inefficiencies in the contracting domain, given there are multiple contract writing systems that continue to challenge the ability to operate responsively, consistently, and cost-effectively to award, administer, and close out mission critical contracts in a timely fashion. CON-IT will allow the contracting community to fully support compliance with financial auditability and Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) goals that depend on the integrity of the data flow through the Procure to Pay (P2P) process.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CON-IT capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

CON-IT system capabilities continue to be developed and enhanced through completion of development sprint cycles in accordance with our agile software development strategy. The CON-IT Integrated Program Office (IPO) has established early user engagement through a series of subject matter expert familiarization events, in which system capabilities produced from each sprint cycle are tested by operational COs and valuable user feedback is collected and incorporated into our requirements backlog. Early Operational Capability (EOC) was achieved in FY18 with initial deployment of current CON-IT capabilities to 12AF (AFSOUTH) and subsequent EOC deployment to 8 additional operational locations across the Air Force in every MAJCOM, except US Air Forces Europe. In addition, the CON-IT IPO will integrate the contracting workforce schoolhouses into our training activities; provide initial training to the instructors; and set the training curriculum for new Air Force CO accessions. The completion of the 8 early deployments and training curriculum greatly aids in our risk reduction and organizational change management efforts. Future system development continues to be planned through an iterative process of sprint\/release planning and backlog grooming activities between our stakeholder partners which ensures that the capabilities developed meet our end users' needs and increase mission success."

Program management office, functional user, and system integrator are trained and functioning as a cohesive, high-performing team. An interagency agreement with US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for risk reduction, prototyping and development activities has been signed and is currently in effect. This agreement requires annual renewal. \n\nCON-IT is not only a contract writing solution but a contract management system for the enterprise business process.  This is accomplished by transitioning to a Business Process Management platform that, once implemented, will allow the enterprise to easily adapt to change by automating contracting phases to the maximum extent possible.  The end state for CON-IT will replace 4 legacy contract writing systems and 6 supporting systems when all increments are fielded.\n\nThe CON-IT roadmap includes five major capabilities. Capability 1 modernizes contract writing for base-level and operational users, allowing the AF's Standard Procurement System version and AFCENTs' O'Contrax to sunset as sites transition to CON-IT. AF Contracting community is focused on replacing AF's SPS before the cybersecurity certifications expire in CY19. Capability 2 deploys the same capability to the acquisition, research, and logistics communities, meeting their unique needs. This capability will result with sunsetting ConWrite and ACPS. Capability 3 and 4 automate pre\/post award activities for the unclassified user base from Capability 1 and 2. Capability 5 implements all the previous capabilities for classified users. \n\nCON-IT is aligned to OSD DPAP's strategy for procurement systems. The program is re-engineering and automating the entire business process, implementing data standards across the community (set by OSD), consolidating 10 legacy systems down to 1, reusing GOTS solutions versus creating a new solution, and employing agile software development methods (a best practice from industry)."

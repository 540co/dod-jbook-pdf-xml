This PE matures Soldier weapons and enabling components \/ subsystems, demonstrates lethal weapons systems with potential to provide greater lethality, target acquisition, fire control, and range at a significantly reduced weight for optimized Soldier and Small Unit system performance. The major focus areas for Soldier Lethality Science and Technology are Soldier weapons and ammunition technologies, protection technologies, cognitive and physical performance measures, training in synthetic training environments, and mission support capabilities such as situational awareness sensors and displays, dismounted power and energy technologies, and Soldier and Small Unit sustainment capabilities. This technology diverse PE also matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage all targets and threats at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day\/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments), and for advancing live training technologies that accurately replicate and realistically represent the effects of current and future weapons systems during force-on-force and force-on-target training. This PE matures and demonstrates effective technology in personal combat clothing, protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear, combat rations, shelters, logistical support items for aerial delivery of personnel and cargo, and energy systems to power current and emerging Soldier-born ISR, sensor, optical, and communication systems with the least weight and sustainment burden on the Soldiers and Small Combat Units. This PE matures and demonstrates technologies supporting the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE), a single, interconnected synthetic training system that will enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon \/ multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. A specific research thrust area is applying systems-based practices to mature and demonstrate scientific and tailored knowledge of Soldiers' physical and cognitive architecture to facilitate rapid and efficient designs, assessments and trade-off analyses of technology insertions on the Soldier. Significant S&T investments are directed to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes while reducing the size and weight of the form factor of the equipment.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology).\n\nAll FY21 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

These methods and algorithms have potential to enable the development of aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities (DOTMLPF) improvements and efficiencies. This Project also uses Soldier assessments to iteratively improve the performance, optimize, and integrate technologies to augment Soldier function (e.g. shoot, move, perceive, decide, and communicate) during missions for maximizing performance. This Project supports the Measuring and Advancing Soldier Tactical Readiness and Effectiveness (MASTR-E) joint Science and Technology program supported by the Office of the Secretary of Defense Close Combat Lethality Task Force.\n\nThis work is directly supported by and fully coordinated across PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) as well as work conducted by Medical Research & Development Command (MRDC), Army Research Institute (ARI), U.S. Military Academy (USMA), and other academic and industry partners. This work is in partnership with Forces Command (FORSCOM) operational units and the appropriate Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) organizations as well as established transition partners, including Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) & Program Executive Office- Soldier (PEO-S). This project also complements and is fully coordinated with work performed across Army, Navy, and Air Force under the Reliance 21 Human Systems Community of Interest: Systems Interfaces & Cognitive Processes and Protection, Sustainment, and Warfighter Performance.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Close Combat Lethality Task Force, the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Soldier Lethality Cross Function Team (CFT) efforts.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Application of this work will yield reduced workload, fewer errors, reduced task times, enhanced Soldier protection, user acceptance, and allow the Soldier to extract maximum performance from the equipment. Representative major efforts address Soldier cognitive load and cognitive fusion research, advanced aircraft design to include flight in degraded visual environments, and development of human performance measures and methods to address current and future human system integration challenges. Individual efforts exploit adaptive learning methods and strategies, applied methods to accelerate expertise development, integration of displays for ease of use and optimized situational awareness, and development of technical frameworks for crew automation integration in Command and Control Systems (C2). Efforts also support flight crew decision-aiding and autonomy, advanced crew station design for aircraft, full mission operations in degraded visual environments, and advanced manned-unmanned teaming concepts.\n\nResults of these efforts are transitioned to the Program Executive Offices (PEO), Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).

These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes; guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems; tracking sensors; software algorithms; and safety rigging that integrates with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors and reduction of Soldier load.\n\nThis Project complements work done in the Science & Technology Precision, Navigation and Timing Modernization priority.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units where they will fight, with whom they will fight with, and in complex operational environments to include dense urban and sub-terrain; within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi- Domain Operations. STE Information Systems (STE-IS) delivers the Common Synthetic Environment consisting of Global Terrain\/One World Terrain (OWT), Training Simulation Software (TSS), and Training Management Tools (TMT). The STE will be available where training occurs (home station, combat training centers, armories, institutions, shipboard, deployed) and will include Air and Ground Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers (RVCTs), a Soldier\/Squad Virtual Training (S\/SVT), and a live training capability. The STE will be cloud-enabled, compatible with the Army Enterprise Network, and service-based through the Common Operating Environment, including Live and Constructive. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.  \n\nThis Project complements work done in PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) \/ Project BE8 (Synthetic Training Environment (STE) Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the STE Cross Functional Team efforts. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

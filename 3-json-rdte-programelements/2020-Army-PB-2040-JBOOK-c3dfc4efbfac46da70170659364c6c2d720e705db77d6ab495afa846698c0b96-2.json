Personnel Transformation (PT) - Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) - The Army's Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) provides a data integration service in which data can be extracted from the legacy human resource systems and transferred to DIMHRS.  The ESB will be a middleware application which will  provide a single interface to and from the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between the Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) , the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems to create more streamlined systems in support of the military mission and personnel transformation goals. \n\n GoArmyEd is an Army Continuing Education System (ACES) program that provides the virtual gateway for soldiers to request Tuition Assistance (TA) and Department of the Army (DA) civilians to request training funds online, anytime for classroom, distance learning, and online college courses. GoArmyEd is a dynamic online portal that automates many of the paper-based processes historically conducted in-person at Army Education Centers. GoArmyEd includes automated registration tools that enforce TA policies and procedures.  It is used by authorized customers to pursue their post secondary educational goals; Army Education Counselors to provide educational guidance; CPMS and TMs to manage civilian training and Colleges to deliver degree and course offerings and to report user progress.\n\nModernization initiatives address continued improvements related to the integration of new users and decreasing reliance on the help desk. GoArmyEd is the Army's enterprise education solution. GoArmyEd has integrated the Reserve Component (USAR and National Guard) and the Department of the Army Civilians. In addition, GoArmyEd is working to add a new data warehouse for HQ data retrieval and user self help tools. Education benefits are paramount to recruiting and retention of quality Soldiers, Civilians and Families.\n\nCommanders Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD) began with the identification of capability gaps arising out of the 2010 Red Book and 2012 Gold Book, two extensive studies directed by senior army leadership to examine suicide prevention (Red Book) and the Army's health and discipline (Gold Book). The studies illustrated that Commanders faced capability gaps in their ability to identify high risk behavior and risk factors, analyze soldier and unit risk, and identify risk trends and develop intervention strategies. CRRD provides Commanders at echelons Company through Major Army Command the ability to visualize and take preventive action to mitigate risk factors impacting their soldiers and formations by going to one dashboard and seeing data from multiple data sources.\n\nThe United States Army Reserve (USAR) utilizes the Regional Level Application Software (RLAS) as an enterprise system for duty attendance, military pay, Soldier records management and training calendar management to access, transact, store and manage Soldier and unit data required to conduct synchronized USAR operations. Unlike the Army Active Component (AC) where Soldier military pay is centrally managed and input at the installation level, the USAR utilizes RLAS to manage and input decentralized Soldier pay transactions at the unit level. RLAS consists of four modules: Pay, Personnel, Training, and Resource Management. Research and Development (R&D) authority and funding will provide RLAS with investment funds for necessary system development and system modifications. R&D funding amounts increase slightly towards the end of RLAS lifecycle (FY 2019 and 2020) in order to fully support the Integrated Pay and Personnel System - Army (IPPS-A) transition.  Annually, USAR will provide sustainment funding.  R&D authority and sustainment funding will meet the  USAR Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and Office of the Secretary of Defense Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) opinions regarding defense information Technology (IT) system for R&D activities. Necessary RLAS system development and system modifications include: 1) IPPS-A interface requirements; 2) implementing Microsoft .net Framework 4.5 standards; 3) implementing new Operating Systems (OS), system utilities and other technology products. Enhanced development and modification to RLAS will improve RLAS system capabilities and bring RLAS into compliance with various Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and audit readiness requirements. RLAS will continue to process duty attendance, military pay, Soldier personnel transactions and training calendars until the system is fully subsumed by IPPS-A."

Three modules support human resources business functions (In\/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over $9 billion combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory. The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. \n  \nCoalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 05.  \n\nArmy Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicide attempts are collected and stored in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement.   ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.\n\nISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Funding supports research and development to comply with Department of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.0 million."

The MC4 System supports other Soldier protection initiatives by providing data for analyses which can be used for identification and development of critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing, integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Effort has also been initiated to integrate MC4 with the Army Chief Information Office (CIO) Network 2020 and Common Operating Environment (COE) and as a program of record in the Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment Working Group.  Funding provides engineering, developmental testing, and integration of information management\/information technology to support Force Health Protection in accordance with the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.\n\nFY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $0.056 million will be used for the engineering effort required to evaluate initiatives that improve the performance of the Defense Healthcare Management Systems (DHMS) Electronic Health Record software on the Army platform, as well as the engineering effort for other Army unique capabilities.  Activities include:\n--Monitor research and development activities with Research partners (United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, and United States Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center) to identify emerging technologies for potential insertion into the electronic health record system."

The near and mid-term focus of the MC4 program is to engineer, design, integrate, test, acquire and field the Army automation infrastructure capabilities supporting fielding of the Defense Healthcare Management Systems Electronic Health Record integrated software application suite, future modernized capability, and other Army requirements.  The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components. Since Electronic Health Record software is a major component of the MC4 System and being developed in increments by the Joint Program, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and planned upgrades.  The MC4 Program works with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities.  These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date.  This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and planned upgrades.  This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities, and forward into the future with a fully modernized system.  Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, cloud computing capability environment, etc.) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available.  Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and planned upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing."

Increment 1 of the new Army Acquisition Domain Data Management (AADDM) capability will focus on programmatic information such as Integrated Master Schedules (IMS), cost and budget, industrial base and contractor information.  Increment II will then begin the connection of live, authoritative Army databases to the Acquisition data warehouse.  Once the business processes and external data sources are providing the data: visualization tools can be utilized to provide key charts\/views that support Army Staff (ARSTAFF) processes such as Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Weapon System Review (WSR), Strategic Portfolio Analysis and Review (SPAR), and budget execution drills. Supporting efforts include business process evaluation and definition to maximize efficiency of the Software integration process. Completion of Increment I PM Tools software integration, demonstration and evaluation of the PM Tools in a 6-9 month pilot event within a minimum of one PEO.  Funding also supports further acquisition integration of external data sources as required.  Further focus will concentrate on delivering more common data views and analytical capabilities to support decision making at Product Manager (PdM), Program Manager (PM), Program Executive Officer (PEO), ASA (ALT), and at ARSTAFF levels. Key events include the PM Tool pilot evaluation and a FP Tool deployment decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).      \n\nHuman Resources Command will continue effort for CCIMM and JCIMS for Financial Audit Readiness Requirement and technical requirements gathering, analysis and documentation to allow TRADOC to conduct the Analysis of Alternatives for the RIE."

The AIE aligns authorities, responsibilities, and resources, for Total Army accessions. It provides the Army's strength through its four missions: (1) enlist Soldiers, (2) commission Officers, (3) fulfill In-Service requirements, and (4) support and sustain. The AIE will replace a majority of the current legacy Accessions IT systems. Successful implementation is of upmost priority for the enterprise. The Accessions Information Environment (AIE) is a COTS-based information technology (IT) software system planned to modernize the Army's Accessions Enterprise. It will be a fully integrated Army-wide enterprise level software system for the accessions workforce to acquire the best-qualified warfighting talent (officer\/enlisted\/internal recruiting requirements\/civilians) to meet all Army manning requirements. The key functions for AIE will include the following core capabilities: lead generation & management, prospecting, interviewing, processing, intelligence, marketing, training & leader development, and pay & incentives. This effort will ultimately ensure the accessions workforce has the information needed to engender commitments, lead future Soldiers, and engage communities in direct contact with young Americans.\n\nHRC Accessioning IT:  In addition, this program supports the development requirements for the Army Human Resources Command (USAHRC) which provides the IT solution necessary to accomplish the Army's Accessioning mission. Supports the ongoing development efforts which provides for the IT solutions necessary to accomplish the Army's Accessioning mission.\n\nArmy Suicide Prevention: This Program Element (PE) develops a pre-entry or entry assessment package that enhances the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development). This PE enhances the Army's ability to identify individuals with a higher likelihood of having already experienced, or of potentially experiencing, sub- clinical behavioral issues, as well as to identify character strengths (e.g., resilience, grit), to ensure that the Army can meet mission requirements in the current and future operating environments. Research in this PE will result in more precise determinations of individual potential for future successful service, and more targeted identification of need for individual assistance (e.g., intervention, training, behavioral health) to increase likelihood of future success."

This application uses full motion video, graphics, and sound to train clients; and schedules clients for classroom-type instruction. It integrates a complete range of transition services and benefits for service members, Department of Defense civilian employees, and their family members as they transition from the military. TAP-XXI is a web-based, three-tiered application with a centralized database for all Transition sites. The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers.  The requirements in place today represent a 300 percent increase over the pre-VOW requirements.  A significant modernization effort within TAP XXI is needed.  Justification: ($ in Millions) FY2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.606 million resources the TAP XXI modernization requirements.  Planned Program includes modernize client management module, Soldier module, and increase reporting capabilities.  \n\nHuman Resource Command (HRC) Core IT: This program supports efforts to plan, design, develop, and test Information Technology (IT) solutions to fulfill the Army's Warfighter Support Mission, accommodate emerging Army requirements, and fulfill Future Army needs.  Ongoing development efforts support multiple functional areas including logistics, personnel, transportation, training, medical\/health protection, and the sustaining base.  The focus of the rationalization effort is to identify value-added applications capable of serving a broader Army enterprise audience and garnering efficiencies through the elimination of outdated, legacy, and duplicative applications.  Applications are upgraded or enhanced to meet compliance with Army Common Operating Environment standards in accordance with Army Application Management Business Office (AAMBO). Additionally, program supports enhancements and modifications to the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS) and iPERMS-Secure (iPERMS-S), as well as development of interfaces based upon emerging requirements, Cybersecurity, functionality and compliance with Army standards.\n\nR-Builder is a living application database system that allows the Manning Program Evaluation Group (MM PEG) to update the database to include various cost drivers and factors used for programming, budgeting for all Army Service members pay, allowances, and benefits for the all-volunteer Army. R-Builder is used to develop the annual Program Objective Memorandum -Budget Estimate Submission (POM-BES), and to develop and manage the Army's military and civilian personnel in order to execute the President's National Security Strategy.\n\nThe Army Review Board Agency (ARBA) operates under the delegated authority of the Secretary of the Army as the final level of appeal for service members in uniform, veterans, and their family members, adjudicating tens of thousands of claimed errors or injustices annually. ARBA is staffed with 128 military personnel, civilians, and contractors, and additional 350 external Advisors and Boards Members. ARBA struggles with the substantial process and system-related inefficiencies. The Agency currently uses the ARBA Case Tracking System (ACTS) to facilitate case adjudication and the routing of corresponding hard copy case files (a.k.a. \"redwelds\"). This system was custom built in 1999, strictly for tracking the hand offs of redwelds. At its inception, ACTS was a huge leap forward; however, as the organization and technology evolved, the system has not been able to meet new Agency mission objectives and streamlining initiatives. This antiquated system costs the Agency multi-millions in annual sustainment fees and lacks the agility to address changing business requirements and organizational roles.\n\nArmy SHARP Data Management System (DMS) Integrated Case Reporting System (ICRS) enhancements will provide stabilization for sexual harassment (SH) data collection, reporting requirements, and analytic processes; ICRS maintains Army sexual assault (SA) legacy data collected prior to 2014 in the Sexual Assault Data Management System (SADMS) IAW public law.\n\nARIMS is the Army's policy and enterprise system deployed to meet statutory (36 CFR) and regulatory (AR 25-1, AR 25-400-2) requirements to manage records that document the policies, decisions, and actions of the Army both as a military department and federal institution. ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY18) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army's classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army's records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations.  Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems. These skill sets are not maintained by government staff and must, by DoD directive (C3I), be acquired from the private sector.\n\nFamily Advocacy System of Records (FASOR) is the information system used by the Army to manage child and adult based abuse incidents referred by the Family Advocacy Program (FAP).  FASOR  is used to capture\/perform  incident case management and allows for standardization of reviews and incident determinations. FASOR  is a key system used in FAP Army Central Registry (ACR) background checks when determining suitability of individuals to be placed into \"positions of trust\".  Finally, FASOR facilitates reporting and data analysis in support of internal, Army, DoD, FOIA and Congressional requirements."

The effort supports over 30 distinct and unique operational databases that directly support research into Veteran claims for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Agent Orange, and other medical conditions developed by Soldiers during combat and non-combat operations. Supports the Army?s Data Center Consolidation by turning data base structure to be more efficient and reduce maintenance support costs.\n\nIncreased Congressional inquiries and litigation have raised leadership awareness of the need to improve records management compliance Army-wide. SecArmy directed workgroup, led by the AASA, with participation by the CIO\/G-6, NETCOM, OGC, and OCLL is to provide a comprehensive solution for the Army and integrate and standardize management systems for the Army?s business operations. Enhancing and modernizing of existing ARIMS functionality and capability to support the SecArmy initiative includes updating ARIMS to support current technology such as Microsoft SharePoint environment, expanding storage capability, including network storage , and commensurate expansion of backup, security and communications capabilities over CONUS and OCONUS networks.  This effort supports the ADCCP program.\n\nThis effort transitioned from 0605013A T05 in FY20 and is not a new start."

This system was custom built in 1999, strictly for tracking the hand offs of redwelds. At its inception, ACTS was a huge leap forward; however, as the organization and technology evolved, the system has not been able to meet new Agency mission objectives and streamlining initiatives.

Additionally, ARBA has undergone increasing congressional scrutiny, unfavorable media conclusions, and publicized court remands surrounding the quality and timeliness of its 18,000 annual adjudication outcomes. As a result, ARBA leadership has committed to Congress that it will drive fundamental change across the DOTMLPF-P spectrum.\n\nIn summary, these significant problems result in greatly extended processing times, bottle-necked and rushed adjudication activities, numerous redundant hand-offs, and at times incorrect or contestable board outcomes. ARBA?s current process requires labor-intensive hard copy printing, collating, transporting, filing, scanning, labeling, inventorying, shipping, shredding, mailing, and tracking of redwelds and their content.\n- ARBA ADS Modernization capability requirements can be summarized as follows: \n- Lifecycle Case Management ?

Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats. Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of training information systems that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting visualization, understanding, and informed decision making.\n\nATIS Capabilities include:\n-  Training Development.  Provides centralized access to training information anytime, anywhere, including educational and professional instruction.\n-  Training Management.  Provides centralized ability to access and manage information, including individual and collective\/unit training that supports mission tasks and individual training records.\n-  Enterprise Scheduling.  Provides a single integrated set of applications to schedule training resources, including transportation, classrooms, ranges, supplies, and mandated legal\/social individual and unit training.\n-  Content Management.  Provides centralized access to training information anytime, anywhere, including educational and professional instruction.\n-  Resource Management.  Provides ability to manage availability\/sustainability of training enablers and resources. \n\nEnhancement of Army Training Models (ATM) will provide the resources to build and sustain readiness requirements in a standardized process for automated methodology development and resource allocation in support of the Army's training needs.\n\nThe Army Career Tracker is leader development tool that leverages Army's prior investments to integrate education, training, assignment, self-development and other systems by linking these valuable technologies and resources into a common user-friendly portal across 1.35 million users consisting of enlisted, officers, and civilians. \nUsers can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership. ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now.  ACT allows users to manage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals. ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning. The unique inter-relationship between the user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and Army's success. Users manage their lifelong learning career objectives, monitor progress towards career development and goals, search multiple Army education and training resources, and receive personalized advice from their supervisor and Army leadership. \nCompleted development will modernize the Army Career Tracker (ACT) system to render web pages correctly base on the size of the screen.  Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design that renders web pages based on the size of the device's display screen (e.g., computer, tablet, and phone). This allows the site to load quickly and ensures the display appears as if it were made expressly for the device being used. RWD improves user experience by displaying messages, links, and controls in a logical manner regardless of the device.  The actual presentation may not look the same across different devices; rather the rendering will depend on the Operating System (OS), screen size, screen resolution, and other factors. Implementing RWD on ACT would be a step forward toward allowing ACT to render better on tablets and other mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones).  \n\nUniversal Course Authoring Tool \/ The UCAT (Universal Curriculum and Assessment Tool) will serve as the primary curriculum and assessment development tool for curriculum development projects in meeting the directives from higher headquarters to transition into a new, digital learning environment. UCAT will support the delivery of curriculum and assessment products on a variety of different platforms in support of both resident and non-resident programs. UCAT consists of server-side applications and associated web services, databases, and client-side components which are currently under development. \n\nMIT LL Networked Pronunciation Feedback Program (NETProf) expansion will allow for further expansion and further utilization of the existing NetProF products for DLIFLC faculty and students. To reach higher levels of proficiency in foreign languages the planned dialog system would give an advantage to DLIFLC teachers to help students gain advances through practicing speaking using this new dialog system, and the connected NetProF improvement system for pronunciation for longer utterances. This feasibility study will help set new parameters for developing very advanced language teaching systems that otherwise could not be supported.  This is in support of the 2+\/2+\/2 plan.\n\nDLPT5 Content Analysis, Categorization & Modeling Development of DLPT5 Content Analysis, Categorization and Modeling (CACM) capabilities. For integration within the DLIFLC MIT LL TIDWA Domino system. These capabilities are in direct response to DLIFLC's DoDI assigned responsibilities for DLPT item bank maintenance, psychometric analysis and informed pool management, and closely support the DLPT Validity Framework."

This will enable Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess Army training requirements. ATIS efforts will ultimately reduce the lifecycle costs of training by retiring more than 29 duplicative, stove-piped systems and improve performance with a net centric, standards-based, architecturally compliant system.  The overarching strategy is centered on three distinct acquisition phases. \n\nPhase I - Program risk mitigation effort. Characterized by competitive selection of three vendors to develop, demonstrate and deliver to the Government three ATIS prototype systems with specified documentation.\nPhase II - Each system will be evaluated at the end of the prototyping phase and one vendor will be selected for engineering, development and deployment.\nPhase III - Upon full deployment of the system, a Sustainment Contract will be awarded for support and potential disposal of the system at the end of its useful life. ATIS intends to use Interim Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS) for initial sustainment beginning at Limited Deployment and will then transition to a hybrid life-cycle sustainment using a combination of CLS and government entities at Full Deployment (FD)."

USMEPCOM conducts its work through 65 Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) across the country and 189 Military Entrance Test Sites (METS). MIRS provides automated support for conducting aptitude tests and medical examinations and administratively processing, enlisting and shipping applicants for the Armed Forces, Reserves, and Coast Guard. This includes support for automated versions of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) tests. MIRS initiates Social Security Administration (SSA) checks for identity verification; interfaces with US Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) to verify citizenship status for military service applicants to screen out individuals that may be security threats; and interfaces with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for background screening, using digital fingerprints to identify\/eliminate individuals with criminal records from entering military service. \n\nMIRS supports recruiting capabilities through electronic interfaces and data sharing, using standard Department of Defense (DoD) data elements with Recruiting Service systems. In the event a military draft is required, MIRS supports mobilization through electronic links with the Selective Service System (SSS) as well as automated support for conducting aptitude tests and medical examinations and administratively processing, inducting and shipping SSS registrants. \n\nCustomers\/beneficiaries of this investment: the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI), including components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, USMEPCOM, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Personnel & Readiness (P&R)\n\nStakeholders include: All Uniformed Services, Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Transportation Management Office (DTMO), OSD P&R, Undersecretary of Defense (USD) Intel, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), and Department of Veteran's Affairs.\nRequested funding underpins system sustainability and scalability and improves cybersecurity to include protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Funding covers costs to redesign\/develop existing MIRS capabilities to operate efficiently in a cloud environment and to integrate with MHS-Genesis. This will allow for the closure of 65 Army data centers, in support of the Army Data Center Consolidation Plan (Army Directive 2016-38) and movement towards the Force of the Future mandate of all digital processing."

                            "val": "Global Force Information Management (GFIM):  GFIM will provide the Army an enterprise, integrated authoritative force management capability for lifecycle management of force\/organizational structure data for the entire Army.  In addition, it will establish a common data standard for force structure data by implementing the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI).  \n\nThe Army Training Information System (ATIS) will provide a common operational picture (COP) of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities. Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats. Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of training information systems that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting visualization, understanding, and informed decision making.  \n\nThe Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to preserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System - Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities.\n\nThe Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System\/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS\/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request\/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).\n\nThis program supports HRC efforts to plan, design, develop, and test Information Technology (IT) solutions to fulfill the Army's Warfighter Support Mission, accommodate emerging Army requirements, and fulfill Future Army needs.  Ongoing development efforts support multiple functional areas including logistics, personnel, transportation, training, medical\/health protection, and the sustaining base.\n\nThe HRC focus of the rationalization effort is to identify value-added applications capable of serving a broader Army enterprise audience and garnering efficiencies through the elimination of outdated, legacy, and duplicative applications.  Applications are upgraded or enhanced to meet compliance with Army Common Operating Environment standards in accordance with Army Application Management Business Office (AAMBO). Additionally, program supports enhancements and modifications to the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS) and iPERMS-Secure (iPERMS-S), as well as development of interfaces based upon emerging requirements, Cybersecurity, functionality and compliance with Army standards. \n\nSOLDIER FOR LIFE-TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM XXI (SFL-TAP XXI): The Transition Assistance Program XXI (TAP-XXI) application provides an interactive, multimedia approach to pre-separation counseling and job assistance training. This application uses full motion video, graphics, and sound to train clients; and schedules clients for classroom-type instruction. It integrates a complete range of transition services and benefits for service members, Department of Defense civilian employees, and their family members as they transition from the military. TAP-XXI is a web-based, three-tiered application with a centralized database for all Transition sites. The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers.  The requirements in place today represent a 300 percent increase over the pre-VOW requirements.  A significant modernization effort within TAP XXI is needed.  Justification: FY2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $606,000 resources the TAP XXI modernization requirements.\n\nThe Defense Language Software Upgrade will perform a major modification to the Universal Course Authoring Tool (UCAT).  The modification will enable the tool to allow the curriculum development department to author new curricula without having to know a programming language, such as HTML. Currently, the tool has limited authoring templets and doesn't support the higher language levels or contain testing templets.  The tool will do the programming automatically in the proper format for online viewing regardless of the mobile device used to view the material.  This will enable the author to input the content in a predetermined way and the program will convert it into the proper online format. There will also be programming support to develop and convert existing online material into the current formats for use with all mobile devices regardless of the operating system used. Our current online material does not support all mobile devices and it needs to be reprogrammed to support all current mobile devices regardless of the Operating System (OS) used (Android, Apple, Microsoft).  The Defense Language Institute (DLI) doesn't have the capability to do any programming modifications to existing programs. The programs are in need of modifications to meet DLI's new graduation standards of 2+\/2+.\n      \nThe Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.   It includes a new effort in FY 2014, the Army Contract Writing System, a replacement for the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS).\n\nArmy Career Tracker (ACT) is a leader development tool created to change significantly the way training, education, and experiential learning support is provided to Army enlisted, officers, civilians, and their leaders\/supervisors.  Users can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership.  ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now.  ACT allows users to manage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals.  ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning.  The unique inter-relationship between the user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and the Army's success.  ACT comprises over 780,000 users with an adoption rate of 4,000 users per week.  HQDA EXORD 054-12 ISO Army Transition mandates that leaders utilize roles in ACT to promote life-long learning and development opportunities throughout the Soldier's lifecycle of service (hire to retire).\n\nThe Defense Language Software Upgrade will perform a major modification to the Universal Course Authoring Tool (UCAT).

The Defense Language Institute (DLI) doesn't have the capability to do any programming modifications to existing programs. The programs are in need of modifications to meet DLI's new graduation standards of 2+\/2+. \n\nCriminal Information Management System (CIMS): CIMS, formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG).  Through CIMS, the USACIDC and the OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program \/ system that houses both classified and unclassified Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data.  CIMS leverages existing and future Army Law Enforcement (LE) enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) providing Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence functions as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  The Consolidated Operations Police Suite (COPS) was previously comprised of five separate applications: two of these applications have been rationalized under ALERTS; the remaining three (related to the Army Corrections discipline) require modernization to ensure continued function and security compliance. RDT&E dollars are required to further enhance & enable CIMS' consolidation\/rationalization of LE applications thereby providing the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime while also facilitating the management of those placed in corrections facilities.  At present, all requested CID RDT&E funding will be applied to CIMS initiatives.\n\nEducational Outreach Initiative:  The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC), a subordinate element of USACIDC, requires funding for educational outreach initiatives including internship positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral candidate levels. The DFSC was designated as the leader for forensic science disciplines (DAPM Memo 4 Oct 2011). This memorandum states that the DFSC will establish a forensic RDT&E program that provides the integration of joint operational research, including procedures for establishing customer requirements, and identifying gaps and needs that lead to RDT&E priorities. The program includes developing a scholarly environment across the Defense Forensic Enterprise through the use of educational partnerships, internships and fellowships to facilitate participation in RDT&E projects.  The Educational Outreach program provides an opportunity for students to contribute to forensic science research and influence shared research priorities across forensic science communities, while simultaneously supporting DFSC laboratory operations. Through the internship program, innovative research is conducted that supports research capabilities across the entire range of defense forensic operations (traditional laboratory, expeditionary (forward-deployed) laboratories, and reach-back functions).  \n\nResearch & Development Identified through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Initiative:  The DFSC requires funds to coordinate the execution of forensic research projects that will enhance the capability of forensic science applications for DoD customers both in traditional law enforcement\/criminal justice settings as well as in expeditionary environments.  The DFSC staff manage federally-funded research & development contracts identified through a two-year, rolling BAA procedure.  The BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals.  Submitted BAA research proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, \"The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984\" (and subsequent applicable amendments).\n\nRegional Level Application Software (RLAS) is a critical IT application to the AR managing the automated military pay, funds control, training calendar management and administrative records management for 198,000 Soldiers. \n\nArmy Software Marketplace (ASM): ASM will enable the Army to have a centralized location to store software applications and application metadata.\n\nChief of Staff, Army (CSA) Leaders' Dashboard: The CSA Leaders' Dashboard will capture and store readiness information in order to produce predictive analytics and facilitate decision making by senior Army leaders."

ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY 2018) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army?s classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army?s records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations. Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems. These skill sets are not maintained by government staff and must, by DoD directive (C3I), be acquired from the private sector.\n\nThis funds contractor man-years for technical and analytical expertise in the integration and validation of operational databases used to store and research combat records from combat operations in Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, Panama, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other contingency operations. The effort supports over 30 distinct and unique operational databases that directly support research into Veteran claims for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Agent Orange, and other medical conditions developed by Soldiers during combat and non-combat operations. Supports the Army?s Data Center Consolidation by turning data base structure to be more efficient and reduce maintenance support costs.\n\nThis line item funds contractor man-year for Middleware Software Engineering for the programming and integration of linkages between ARIMS, Army Information Systems and NARA?s Gateway, that generate or store long-term important records as part of functional business processes. Failure to fund at the requested level will preclude the efficient, effective, and transparent capture and preservation of important Army records generated by Army Information Systems. Without this capability, Army Information System managers will be required to manually extract and index records for submission and preservation in the ARIMS system. This effort supports the ADCCP program to ensure efficient use of Army resources and fulfill RMDA?s mission.\n\nIncreased Congressional inquiries and litigation have raised leadership awareness of the need to improve records management compliance Army-wide. SecArmy directed workgroup, led by the AASA, with participation by the CIO\/G-6, NETCOM, OGC, and OCLL is to provide a comprehensive solution for the Army and integrate and standardize management systems for the Army?s business operations. Enhancing and modernizing of existing ARIMS functionality and capability to support the SecArmy initiative includes updating ARIMS to support current technology such as Microsoft SharePoint environment, expanding storage capability, including network storage, and commensurate expansion of backup, security and communications capabilities over CONUS and OCONUS networks. This effort supports the ADCCP program.\n\nThis effort transitions to 0605013A project FM7 in FY20."

The PPB BOS system standardize and integrate the transactional information systems used in the Headquarters Department of Army (HQDA)  Programming and Budgeting processes.   The program is streamlining programming and budgeting business processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The PPB BOS architecture reengineers, streamlines, and consolidates HQDA systems and financial feeder systems; aligns to the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA); implements powerful business intelligence analytical tools to support strategic planning, programming, and budgeting within HQDA; and provides access to GFEBS funds management and execution data through system interfaces with required SFIS compliancy integral to the PPB BOS data model.  The LEAP program will provide criminal intelligence querying and reporting capabilities in compliance with regulatory and policy standards for Army Law Enforcement regarding investigation of felony crimes.  LEAP captures criminal case investigative information regarding incidents, location descriptors, entities (name, social security number, rank, title, physical characteristics, sex, birth place, and date), agent assignment, crime description and identifiers, statements, property data, laboratory tests; verifies and stores this data for criminal intelligence purposes: and reports this information to the proper authorities from the Division Commanding Officer to the United States Grand Jury.  The system will extract necessary data for consolidation and input to Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) monthly reports, National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) monthly reports and the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII) daily updates.  The LIMS system will automate business processes that support the forensic examiners. These processes include, but are not limited to, analytics, materials management, management reporting, Freedom of Information Act requests (FOIA), legal discovery request, court preparation and outsource processing.\n\nCivilian Personnel Online - Portal (CPOL-Portal) is a one stop secure site which provides Army civilian employees and HR specialists access to a private portal with a complete set of employment related resources, links and web based applications that require single sign-on access - Army Regional Tools (ART). CPOL-Portal will provide an Integrated Management System (IMS) in support of Civilian Workforce Transformation (CWT). It will support Civilian human capital decision making and allow leaders and\nemployees to perform their roles more efficiently in support of Army goals and missions. CPOL Portal will provide the full spectrum of IT application support and access to Acquire, Develop, Distribute and Sustain components of the Army Civilian HCM Life-Cycle and link to G3 'Structure' IT Enterprise Applications.\n\nThe Fully Automated System for Classification (FASCLASS) is a centralized, web-based system that maintains civilian position descriptions and position related information across Department of the Army.  It provides classifiers and managers capability to create, edit, and verify position descriptions.  Also it offers robust search, report generation, and lookup & support capabilities.\n\nThe Overseas Entitlement Tracker (OET) provides the capability to accurately track Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). LQA is provided to reimburse employees for suitable, adequate living quarters at posts where the U.S. Government does not provide quarters. OET also tracks these other overseas entitlements for employees: Advance Pay, Danger Pay, Imminent Danger Pay, Foreign Differential, Home Leave, Post Allowance, Separation Maintenance Allowance, and Temporary Quarters Subsistence Allowance."

As stated above, these are primarily related to meeting minimum DoD regulatory requirements related to the collection of mishap information, safety information storage, and resolving inefficiencies in data quality control and information flow.\n\nAdditionally, advances in technology allow for improvements in performance and data integrity that currently are deficiencies in the system. ASMIS-R, in its current state, does not provide any IT (material solution) to the business requirements identified above. The Command has utilized a FFP contract to execute specific Task Orders to develop the tools and products through mid-year FY 2015.

Development tasks will be performed by AG-1 CP's contractor staff, whose performance is monitored according to the Quality Assurance Surveillance Program. In addition, unit testing and operational testing will be implemented to ensure the new functionality performs as required.

                                        "val": "Global Force Information Management (GFIM):  GFIM will provide the Army an enterprise, integrated authoritative force management capability for lifecycle management of force\/organizational structure data for the entire Army.  In addition, it will establish a common data standard for force structure data by implementing the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI).  \n\nArmy Training Information System (ATIS) is an enterprise system that will provide a common operational picture of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities.  These capabilities will enable commanders, leaders, soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess training requirements so they can more effectively plan, prepare, execute, and assess training. End result is an ATIS that enables soldiers to train as they fight so they can effectively fight as they have trained. \n\nAdapt\/improve\/install\/field government off the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and new software to perform various tasks in a networked environment such as data warehousing, force management, personnel, installation and environmental databases and applications to support Business System Transformation and Installation Management, to include Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard.\n\nThe Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System\/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS\/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request\/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).\n\n HRC Core IT: Award date shown reflects iPERMS IT Integration Contract.  SMS-WEB and ASBS 2.0 are on the Digital Application Support Task Order (DASTO) with an award date of  6 Feb 18. \n\nCriminal Information Management System (CIMS): CIMS formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the Criminal Investigation Command (CIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG). Thru the CIMS, USACIDC and OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program \/ system that  houses Classified and Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data, leveraging existing and future Army LE enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system, known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS), provides US Army Law Enforcement stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of Law Enforcement and criminal intelligence (CrimIntel) functions; as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements. RDT&E dollars are required to further enhance ALERTS and other CIMS systems to continue the consolidation\/rationalization of LE applications, and to give the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime.\n\nEducational Outreach Initiative:  The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC), a subordinate element of USACIDC, requires funding for educational outreach initiatives including internship positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral candidate levels. The DFSC was designated as the leader for forensic science disciplines (DAPM Memo 4 Oct 2011). This memorandum states that the DFSC will establish a forensic RDT&E program that provides the integration of joint operational research, including procedures for establishing customer requirements, and identifying gaps and needs that lead to RDT&E priorities."

An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System - Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps.  Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps.

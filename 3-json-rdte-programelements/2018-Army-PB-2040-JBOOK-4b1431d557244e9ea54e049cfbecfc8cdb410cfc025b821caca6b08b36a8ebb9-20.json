Funds required to support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects are included in this PE.  In addition, support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address environmental quality requirements are included under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Program.\n\nThe Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that both achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change in the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal.  It includes systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life.  It provides support to the system acquisition community, e.g., program and project managers, to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process.  The goal is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs and includes efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities and to ensure the availability of Halon 1301 to support weapon system fire suppression requirements.  \n\nThe Pollution Prevention Tech Support Project funds the management support costs to execute the Toxic Metals Reduction and Airborne Lead Reduction environmental quality technology programs."

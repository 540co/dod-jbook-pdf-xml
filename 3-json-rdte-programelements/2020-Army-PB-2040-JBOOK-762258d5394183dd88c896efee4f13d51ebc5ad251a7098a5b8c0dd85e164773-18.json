Multi-Mode Seeker will integrate Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) STRIKE-X program demonstrated capabilities into ATACMS.  This effort focuses on providing integration of a seeker to search, detect, acquire, and engage moving maritime\/land-based targets. There is no funding in FY 2020\n\nProject 688 is a developmental effort for the Palletized Field Artillery Launcher.  Palletized Field Artillery Launcher (PFAL) is a palletized erectable, MLRS-similar, launcher capable of firing the Multiple Launched Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges in excess of 400 kilometers.   Palletized Field Artillery Launcher provides alternatives to deliver near-term innovative long-range strike capabilities to Combatant Commanders.  This effort will design, develop, and deploy a safe and effective launcher system and integrate multiple sub-systems, including an erectable palletized MLRS launcher, a Fire Control System (FCS), a communications system, and a Power Management System in a continuous user evaluation with Soldiers.  In FY2020, PFAL transitions from Strategic Capability Office (SCO) to the Army.

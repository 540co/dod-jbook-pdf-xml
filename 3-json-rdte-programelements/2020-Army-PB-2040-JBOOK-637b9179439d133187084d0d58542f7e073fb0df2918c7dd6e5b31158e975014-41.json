            "val": "Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced commercial capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of software capability drop releases will be provided into Army Common\/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.\n\nDCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.   This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI).  \n\nDCGS-A provides technologically advanced Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  \n\nFY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $38.121 million for D07, DCGS-A, will be used for modification, testing and integration of commercially available technologies to support multi-source intelligence processing at the tactical levels, as directed in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 113 and Section 220 that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires. DCGS-A will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities. This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE), while providing iterative software updates required to remain current.  DCGS-A will focus on Capability Drop (CD) CD 2.  CD 2 will replace DCGS-A data management capabilities hosted at Echelons Above Corps, and adds advanced analytics and Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning capabilities.  CDs 3-7 will provide enhanced Army Intelligence capabilities to the majority of Army Intelligence formations.  CD 3 will provide a modernized Data Management Architecture, leveraging open standards based on the DI2E that will allow additional capabilities (CDs 4-7) to be added in a plug and play fashion.  CD 3 will deliver improved interoperability aligned with the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) and the concepts of converged Operations and Intelligence associated with the Command Post Computing Environment.  CD-3 will also provide automated \"Level 2 Fusion\" capabilities and a consistent user visualization framework.   CD 4 will provide targeting and collection management tools, Natural Language Processing, Text Analytics, and Open Source Analytics capabilities.  CD 5 will provide improved Counter Intelligence and Human Intelligence Reporting capabilities.  CD 6 will focus on Signals Intelligence analysis and Intelligence Support to Cyber Operations. CD 7 will support Geospatial capabilities for the Army's combat engineers and the Imagery Analyst.

The DCGS-A program will consist of multiple capability drops structured to meet DCGS-A User requirements.  The DCGS-A program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively provide and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment\/hardware, providing low risk, efficient, time- phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army's operational needs.\n\nThe DCGS-A capabilities under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the future DCGS-A requirements set. The DCGS-A will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.\n\nDCGS-A is a collection of software packages (COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data. DCGS-A delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon's intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons.  DCGS-A provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.\n\nThe DCGS-A software baseline will be updated and iteratively deployed to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements. PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, will  align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk integration and test cycle times. As Capability Drop 3-7 requirements are approved, DCGS-A will leverage commercially-available solutions and non-developmental items (NDI) to meet user needs, based on market research results.   DCGS-A will issue commercial contracts or conduct NDI technology transitions from DoD Science and Technology organizations, or will re-use NDI from other Army programs, Services, or other Governmental Agencies. The DCGS-A software will be hardware agnostic so that the software can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment. This allows the DCGS-A software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons. The implementation of the latest COTS hardware procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, will result in significant cost efficiencies."

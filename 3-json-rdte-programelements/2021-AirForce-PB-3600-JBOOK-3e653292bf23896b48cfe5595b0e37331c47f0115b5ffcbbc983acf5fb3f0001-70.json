That increase and enacted request was not accounted for correctly in the database and reflected a -$15M overall reduction.  The correct total for LTRS in FY 2020 is $20.837M, not $5.837M.\n\nThe Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), provides public safety and assured access to space.  LTRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB\/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA. LTRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests.  LTRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely; together with national security space launch capability, LTRS provides assured access to space for the nation.  The ER and WR are designated as Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB).\n\nLTRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data.  The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing & Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.\n\nThe Air Force requires RDT&E funds to conduct digital data processing and transport prototype and proof of concept projects supporting Range of the Future (ROTF) launch operations. Funds will provide engineering and analysis to develop promising technology and validate LTRS architecture ability to meet the accelerating National launch requirement and introduce advanced data transport formats. These include demonstration of virtualized and remote data processing as well as dispersed and disaggregated flight tracking. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver LTRS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nFunding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in PE 0305182F, Space Lift Range System.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

            "val": "M-SHORAD is an Air Defense weapon system consisting of multiple ground-to-air missile launchers, sensors and a gun on a Stryker A1 combat vehicle. M-SHORAD provides the Army improved capabilities for defense of maneuver formations and other tactical echelons from low altitude air attack and surveillance. Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten the ability of maneuver forces to conduct operations. Specifically, maneuver formations require the improved M-SHORAD air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.  \n\nThe M-SHORAD capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach with a rapidly fielded Initial M-SHORAD system (supported by an Army Approved Directed Requirement) and an enduring M-SHORAD (supported by a Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved Capability Development Document (CDD) or Capability Production Document (CPD)) that will field the full capability. First, the Army will field the Initial M-SHORAD solution based on a FY 2018 Directed Requirement, which was informed by the FY 2017 M-SHORAD Demonstration. This system will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include FW, RW, and Group 3 UAS while keeping pace and surviving with the maneuver Brigades. The Initial M-SHORAD will be fielded to four M-SHORAD battalions. In addition, M-SHORAD will transition the Multi-Mission High Energy Laser (MMHEL) from Science and Technology into the M-SHORAD Program of Record. With the increased capability provided by the MMHEL technology, M-SHORAD will provide the long term capability to counter a broader range of FW, RW, UAS, and indirect fires (RAM) threats.\n\nFY 2020 dollars in the amount of $39.100 million ($33.100 million base and $6.000 million OCO) will complete the Initial M-SHORAD capability development and integration into existing maneuver formation equipment. Efforts will include: completion of testing to achieve Urgent Materiel Release and Safety Certification; continuation of the development; and finalization of the required program documentation."

The OTA efforts include: Mission Equipment Package (MEP); Platform Integrator effort to procure the Stryker vehicle and integrate the MEP; and the Stinger Launcher.\n\nIn addition, the Program Office will use FY 2021-2024 funds for an M-SHORAD with the MMHEL capability. The Program Office plans to award a single competitive OTA agreement. In FY 2021-2024, the Program will conduct development activities, component qualification, Operational Performance Assessment and Logistics and Safety Certifications.

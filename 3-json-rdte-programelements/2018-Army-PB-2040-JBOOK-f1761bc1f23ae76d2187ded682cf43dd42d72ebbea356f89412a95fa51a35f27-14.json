            "val": "This program element provides night vision\/reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition technologies required for U. S. defense forces to engage enemy forces twenty-four hours a day under conditions of degraded visibility due to darkness, adverse weather, battlefield obscurants, foliage and man-made structures.  These developments and improvements to high performance night vision electro-optics, radar, laser, and thermal systems and integration of related multi-sensor suites will enable near to long range target acquisition, identification and engagement to include significant fratricide reduction, which will improve battlefield command and control in \"around-the-clock\" combat operations.  \n\nProject EQ9 focuses on a kit of electronic devices that acquires, collects, and transmits data to provide near real time feedback in order to validate, follow, locate, or track a target (i.e., tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL)).  Using  electronic audio and\/or video recorders, information obtained will validate movement and identify targets.  In addition, threat monitoring can be integrated into existing operational tools, help to paint a clearer picture of the battlefield, pinpoint possible target locations, and identify and exploit enemy movements and patterns.  CATR has been fielded since 2005 as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program. \n\nProject L67 develops, improves and miniaturizes high performance night vision electro-optics, thermal and laser systems.  It also provides for systems integration of related multi-sensor suites to enable near to long-range target acquisition and engagement as well as improved battlefield command and control in around-the-clock combat operations. It focuses on adapting demonstrated technologies that bring improvements to the dismounted Soldiers' equipment.  This project develops or enhances equipment that provides the individual Soldier's day\/night situational awareness and individual targeting capability, sniper fire detection and location capability, and integrates improved target location and self-location capability to eliminate friendly fire incidents. Includes costs associated with efforts for integration and interface of products on Soldiers' head, body, and weapons.\n\nProject L70 focuses on night vision, reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) sensor and suites of sensors to provide well-defined surveillance and targeting capabilities for a variety of Current, Modular, and Future Force platforms. This project includes: 3rd Generation Forward Looking Infra-Red (3GEN FLIR) B-Kit development activities, the 3GEN Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3) Modification Work Order (MWO) to integrate 3GEN FLIR B-Kit,and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology ASA(ALT) Common Operating Environment (COE) effort to meet sensor interoperability requirements and improve the soldier-machine interface of the Program of Record (POR).\n\nProject L75 focuses on development of Profiler Block enhanced capabilities for meteorological (MET) measurement sensors and data.  Improvements have reduced the footprint (less soldiers\/vehicles) and complexity of the system, improved performance (accuracy), improved survivability, connectivity, no balloon sensor, multiple initialization data, and terrain visualization. The improved MET message data will increase lethality by enabling artillery a greater probability of first round hit with indirect fire systems.  Profiler Block III provides a networked laptop configuration while further reducing the system's logistics footprint with the elimination of the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) mounted shelter and trailer located in the Tactical Operations Center (TOC).  The Profiler Virtual Module (PVM), a product improvement to the Block III, concept includes the following updates: update of weather model; update of software architecture removing legacy Block I code and creating a modular framework; development in conjunction with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) program including AFATDS, to provide increased interoperability and usability; and to enable operation of the Profiler system in a virtual machine for use in the Common Operating Environment (COE) versions 2,3,4,and 5.  This concept is a flexible approach that supports use of existing Block III hardware, increased accuracy during technical refresh of hardware with higher performance computers, and virtualization on the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) server. \n\nProject L76 matures technologies and capabilities which benefit the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR, AN\/PED-1, AN\/PED-1A, and AN\/PED-1B) and the Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS).  These precision targeting and next generation systems are used by dismounted Soldiers to locate, identify, and target enemy assets. This project focuses on reducing size, weight, power and cost, improving imaging performance, and increasing targeting accuracy. Targeting accuracy improvements will focus on developing and integrating affordable, non-magnetic, high accuracy, full-time (24\/7), and all weather Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices, with reduced size, weight and power characteristics into the LLDR system.  Long term goals include improving current celestial navigation systems to increase operational availability, developing precision targeting capabilities that will operate in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment, and integration of Military Global Positioning System (GPS) User Equipment (M-Code) (next generation GPS) receivers into LLDR and JETS, when available.\n\nProject L79 focuses on the Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS).  JETS is an Army program with joint interest (Air Force and Marine Corps). JETS will meet the one-man, hand-held precision targeting gap identified by the Fire Center of Excellence (FCOE). JETS is a light-weight, handheld system that will provide the single dismounted observer and Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) with a common, enhanced day and night thermal capability to rapidly acquire, accurately locate, positively identify, and precisely designate targets. JETS Target Location and Designation System (TLDS) will be able to interface with existing and future Service Forward Entry Systems (FESs). After initiating JETS TLDS production, this project will address continued development and integration of improved precision targeting components to reduce size, weight, power, and cost of the system, to address operation in environments where GPS is denied, and to integrate M-code GPS receivers when they become available."

The family utilizes advancements in thermal and low light level sensors to produce Individual (I), Crew-Served (CS), and Sniper (S) weapon sights operable in-line with a day optic or in stand-alone mode.  This project integrates smaller pixel focal plane arrays in multiple large format sizes to improve sensitivity, clarity, and range, while simultaneously reducing the size, weight and power consumption of both the Crew-Served and Sniper variants.  The FWS-I variant is a weapon mounted long-wave infrared sensor that enables Soldiers to fire quickly and accurately from any carry position and with significantly reduced exposure to enemy fire by providing a wireless zeroed weapon aimpoint in the Soldier's goggle. Leveraging the success of the Individual variant development, the FWS-CS variant operates as the primary sight; it includes a wireless Helmet Mount Display (HMD) and provides the Soldier with input from a laser rangefinder device, resulting in a more accurate aimpoint that adjusts automatically for range, ammunition characteristics, and vertical angle. The FWS-S variant mounts in-line with the Sniper's direct view optic providing a thermal imagery capability to the host weapon at the weapon's maximum effective range, plus 20% overmatch.  FWS-S provides Snipers a large format display with increased pixel density that enables accurate long range engagements while maintaining day sight, extending the lethality and provide exceptional observation."

                            "val": "This project performs Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) on high performance night vision, Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) systems and other related systems that allow forces to locate and track enemy units in day, night, and all battlefield conditions, and through natural and man-made structures and obscurants.  It also develops and integrates suites of these sensors to provide well-defined surveillance and targeting capabilities, as well as architectures for these sensors to communicate automatically.  These efforts focus on meeting the requisite night vision and RSTA capabilities required for evolving Current Force, Modular Force, and Future Force systems.\n\nThe project supports the 3rd Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) B-Kit EMD program, which incorporates the next generation of forward looking infrared technologies.  The 3GEN FLIR EMD program will leverage critical technology development from the Advanced Thermal Imaging EMD and Combat Vehicle Advanced Sensor Technology (CVAST) effort to develop a common 3GEN FLIR B-Kit for integration into US Army FLIR sensor systems in accordance with the approved Improved Forward Looking Infrared (I-FLIR) Capability Development Document (CDD).  The common 3GEN FLIR B-Kit prescribed by the I-FLIR CDD will allow the Army to achieve economies of scale and avoid duplicative engineering and development costs.  As a result, 3GEN FLIR capabilities can be delivered at a lower cost to the Abrams, Bradley, and Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3), while potentially leveraging 3GEN FLIR components for airborne applications.  The 3GEN FLIR B-Kit provides Mid Wave Infrared and Long Wave Infrared digital video and the electronic interfaces required to integrate the 3GEN FLIR technology with the host platform sensor.  When integrated in current sensor packages, 3GEN FLIR technology enhances the war-fighters' survivability and lethality through increased identification range performance, while enabling the detection of difficult or obscured targets and faster threat detection through automated processes.  The 3GEN FLIR B-Kit EMD program is also a key element in maintaining the Army's FLIR industrial base.\n\nThe project supports LRAS3 Modification Work Order (MWO) to integrate 3GEN FLIR B-Kit.  The LRAS3 MWO effort includes integration of 3GEN FLIR B-Kit technology, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and an M-code Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.  Collectively, these capabilities will improve the Far Target Location (FTL) accuracy of the LRAS3 and enhance the scout's survivability and lethality through increased detection, recognition and identification range performance.\n\nThis project also executes the Army Sensor Computing Environment (CE) effort which is part of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA-ALT) Common Operating Environment (COE) program.  The Sensor CE effort focuses on increasing sensor interoperability across the enterprise and improving the Soldier-machine interface.  This is done by defining, demonstrating and standardizing Sensor interfaces across the Army networks.  Standardized interfaces delivered from this effort will be incorporated into current and future sensor systems and programs.\n\nFY 2018 Base Funding in the amount of $52.900 million supports the 3GEN FLIR B-Kit EMD program activities as well as the initiation of the 3GEN LRAS3 Modification Work Order (MWO) effort to integrate 3GEN FLIR B-Kit, an IMU, and an M-code GPS receiver; and completion of the performance specification and solicitation documentation.  Additionally, FY 2018 Base Funding supports the continued activities associated with meeting sensor interoperability requirements and improving the Soldier-machine interface in support of the Army's vision of the Common Operating Environment (COE)."

After a successful MS B decision, competitive EMD contracts were awarded to design, develop, integrate and test the 3GEN FLIR B-Kit prior to production and mitigate the industrial base risk.  The host platforms are responsible for integration of the 3GEN FLIR B-Kit.\n\n3GEN Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3): After a Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) review planned for 2Q FY2017, 3GEN LRAS3 will perform technical trade studies to determine modifications required to the current LRAS3 to integrate 3GEN FLIR B-Kit technology, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and an M-coded Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.  Contract preparation activities are planned for the Modification Work Order (MWO) award in 3Q FY 2018.   \n\nSensor CE: Additional Fiscal Year 2018 activities include continued development of the sensor interoperability requirement and improving the Soldier-machine interface in support of the Army's vision of the Common Operating Environment (COE)."

PVM improves accuracy of predictive fires solutions and allows for first round effects on target and reduces the risk of fratricide. This capability increases the lethality of indirect fire systems such as the rocket launchers, self-propelled or towed howitzers, and mortars.\n\nFY2018 Base funding is $0."

This project focuses on reducing size, weight, power and cost, improving imaging performance, and increasing targeting accuracy. Targeting accuracy improvements will focus on developing and integrating affordable, non-magnetic, high accuracy, full-time (24\/7), and all weather Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices, with reduced size, weight, and power characteristics into the LLDR system. Long term goals include improving current celestial navigation systems to increase operational availability, developing precision targeting capabilities that will operate in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment to improve situational awareness, and to integrate Military Global Positioning System (GPS) User Equipment (M-Code) (next-generation GPS) receivers into LLDR and JETS, when available."

JETS Target Location and Designation System (TLDS) will be able to interface with existing and future Forward Entry Systems (FESs). After initiating JETS TLDS production, this project will address continued development and integration of improved precision targeting components to reduce size, weight, power, and cost of the system, to improve situational awareness, to address operation in environments where Global Positioning System (GPS) is denied, and to integrate Military GPS User Equipment (M-Code) GPS receivers when they become available."

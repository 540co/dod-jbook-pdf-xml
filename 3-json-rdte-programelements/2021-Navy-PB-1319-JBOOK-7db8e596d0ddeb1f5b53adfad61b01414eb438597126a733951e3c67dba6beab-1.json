                            "val": "The mission of the Aerial Target Systems Development program is the design and development of threat representative subsonic and supersonic aerial targets that simulate threat weapon systems, threat aircraft or threat Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  In addition to representative air vehicles, this includes development of Target Control (TC) systems, and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA\/AS) which are used to replicate specific threats.  Targets and auxiliary payloads are developed to support test and evaluation of combat systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment.  As to specific hardware development, this project includes:\n\n - Supersonic Targets: Portfolio includes GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST), GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST), and AQM-37 programs. Supersonic targets represent supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats. The design and development of GQM-163A capabilities provide threat representative targets that are used in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons programs and to a lesser degree, support fleet training. Critical live-fire Test and Evaluation events are supported for AEGIS, DDG-1000, LHA-6, CVN-78, LCS, and LSD-41\/49 (SM-6, SM-2, RAM, SSDS, and ESSM). The GQM-163A is a non-recoverable supersonic sea skimming aerial target, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.5 and cruise altitudes from 13.0 to 66 ft. The GQM-163A has also demonstrated  higher altitude diving threat profiles. MSST was a supersonic development effort that was terminated on September 25, 2015. Once the contract termination costs have been determined by DCMA, funds may be required to cover settlement costs. However, the requirement still exists to provide a multi-stage vehicle presentation. New supersonic target development efforts include a replacement target for AQM-37.\n\n - Subsonic Targets: Portfolio includes BQM-177A, and BQM-34 & BQM-74 subsonic target programs. The BQM-177A SSAT development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats, replacing legacy BQM-74E targets with a modernized subsonic target with increased capabilities.  The BQM-177A SSAT provides threat representation for developmental and operational test & evaluation events of major combat weapons systems programs and in support of fleet training events.  Specifically, the BQM-177A SSAT provides critical live-fire test and evaluation events for AEGIS, SM-6, SM-2, RAM, and ESSM.  BQM-34s are undergoing product improvement program efforts to increase their current performance envelope to meet evolving Fleet training requirements and weapon system test events.   \n\n - Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), and Target Control and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TC\/TA\/AS) development: the TTSP portfolio provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial targets to provide threat representative radio frequency signatures, specifically the electronic attack and threat radar emissions (active emitters). Development of threat representative simulation components is on-going and required to keep pace with evolving threats and ensure that the Navy's threat simulation capabilities maintain warfighter readiness in the current environment. TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  The mission also includes the design, development and qualification of various TMSS projects including but not limited to: Target RF datalink hardware, ground control hardware and software, scorer transponders, scoring ground stations, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification, friend or foe transponders, and associated test sets. TA\/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles and provide for high fidelity simulation of foreign threats. TA\/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics. TA\/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar scoring systems. \n\nIn addition to the design and development of target hardware and software, funding supports studies performed by a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development.  For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach."

TTSP equipment in various configurations is certified for carriage in aerial\/surface targets. Funding supports the continued development of the TTSP portfolio so that the Navy can keep pace with emerging enemy threats.  Funding is provided for the development of Target Control (TC) systems and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA\/AS) capable of supporting Test and Evaluation (T&E) and fleet training activities to ensure emerging threat simulation requirements are met.  Target Control Systems (TCS) involve the improved command and control systems capable of controlling multiple targets simultaneously while delivering adequate fidelity of T&E telemetry data.  The TMSS program portfolio provides target control, scoring, location, and navigation of air, land and seaborne targets for fleet training and weapons systems test and evaluation.  Funding also supports the design, development and qualification of TMSS including but not limited to the current and next generation TC systems, scalar scorers, scoring ground station, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification friend or foe and associated test sets.  Augmentation and auxiliary systems must be capable of augmenting targets in support of radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement\/test, radar cross section evaluation, decoy effectiveness, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare, warhead effectiveness and evaluation of fleet tactics, readiness, and training."

These development efforts will continue to be rolled into the production baseline. Production efforts are expected to continue at higher quantities in order to meet projected MDAP T&E requirements. Additionally, development of alternative supersonic targets is being explored. \n\nCongress was notified on September 25, 2015 that the Department of the Navy made the decision to terminate the Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) development program. Termination settlement efforts are ongoing with DCMA.\n\nSubsonics: The Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) program is an ACAT-IV program. The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 3 contract was awarded in 3rd Quarter of FY19 with Full Rate Production (FRP) Contracts to follow. Engineering Change Proposals will be contracted as required via IDIQ contract vehicles to keep pace with emerging threat systems and changes rolled into the production baseline. Development efforts for other subsonic targets will be resourced via other contracting efforts as required.\n\nTarget Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), Target Control, and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems: The acquisition strategy for these components vary, depending on industry responses to government issued Requests for Information, but most are acquired via Firm Fixed Price IDIQ contracts."

            "val": "This program element provides for development, rapid prototyping, testing, and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Special Operation Forces (SOF) must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Counter Unmanned Arial Systems (C-UAS) efforts rely on cutting edge detection sensors, both passive and active, paired with kinetic and non-kinetic defeat systems will allow SOF Operators to conduct Special Forces missions in denied and hostile environments worldwide.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  This R-1 program element includes $6.000 million of FY2020 enduring Overseas Contingency Operations funding. \n\nMISO:\nThis project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production\/distribution\/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.\n\nWeapons Systems:\nThis project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.\n\nSoldier Protection and Survival Systems:\nThis project provides for the development, testing, integration, rapid prototyping, and evaluation of specialized equipment, to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF in varied missions; counter-improvised explosive device systems, to meet continually emerging Counter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) threats; C-UAS (aerial, ground and maritime) to mitigate and defeat the emerging and rapidly evolving unmanned system threats; and signature reducing materials and technologies, to reduce the probability of detection by battlefield threat sensors. C-UAS Family of Systems supports the development, integration and testing of Counter Unmanned (Aerial, Ground, Maritime) Sensor Integration Module (SIM) Family of Systems that enhance the Soldier\u2019s ability to detect, track, identify, exploit and defeat specific stand-off unmanned weapon threats, and to acquire objects of military significance before the Soldier is detected and to target threat objects accurately for engagement by soldiers counter-UAS defeat capabilities.\n\nBody Armor and Associated Equipment:\nThis project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.\n\nVisual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF and facilitate future Hyper-Enabled Operator capabilities.  Programs in this area include binocular\/monocular devices; next generation laser designation and geo-location systems; weapon aiming lasers, scopes and accessories; and training and simulation systems.\n\nCommunications Equipment and Electronics Systems:\nThis project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.\n\nTactical Systems Development:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. \n\nTactical Radio Systems:\nThis project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied\/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.\n\nMunitions Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign\/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seekers, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software, and missile delivery on to SOF platforms. SOPGM development efforts utilize, to the extent possible, Middle Tier Acquisition methods to rapidly explore, prototype, demonstrate, test, and field new capabilities for near-term combat requirements, such as autonomous and synchronized targeting and strike technology, precision guided projectile ammunition, munition-based aerial sensor delivery vehicles, and alternative precision navigation technologies."

The results of this effort will enhance the soldiers ability to detect, track, identify and defeat specific stand-off weapon threats, to acquire objects of military significance before the soldier is detected and to target threat systems accurately for engagement by the soldiers. This system integration will take the man-out-of-the-loop for detection of threat systems and include man-in-the-loop for defeat capabilities. To accomplish this objective, the project will be broken down into the following: (1) technology and concept evaluation, (2) prototype development, and (3) prototype evaluation and assessment.  This program received overseas contingency operations (OCO) funding in FY2019."

SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success."

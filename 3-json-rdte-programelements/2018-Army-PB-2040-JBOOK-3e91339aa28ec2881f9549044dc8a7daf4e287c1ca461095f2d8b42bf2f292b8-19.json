Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, as well as the maturation and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Benefits include maturing technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, informing emerging requirements for future systems, and reducing technology risk in order to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs. In Project DS3, Technology Maturation Initiative efforts mature and integrate advanced component technologies into system and sub-system technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes, which are then validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and programs of record. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototypic platforms. Project EX3 funds experimental prototyping and demonstration of ground vehicles to assess future concepts and designs against selected capability trades, and emerging technologies for current and future combat vehicles across the combat vehicle portfolio. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) efforts and acquisition programs.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), and US Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT)."

Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) efforts mature and integrate component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes are validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and acquisition programs of record to inform emerging requirements for future systems and reduce the risk of technology insertion. These efforts are typically 2-4 years in duration, and are directed by an Army Senior Executive Steering Group (ESG) based on priority and opportunity, to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Activities include the maturation, integration and demonstration of HEL prototype weapons performance on a combat platform in realistic operational environments.  A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sensors, and optics for maneuvering brigade combat teams (BCTs). Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototypic platforms. CPE efforts facilitate rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping in a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for early performance verification of new capabilities and transition into acquisition programs.

The CPE will reduce the cost and the time required for testing and evaluating air and ground vehicle systems, thereby reducing acquisition risk and enabling rapid transition of new warfighting capabilities."

        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element(PE)are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps) to include specific Marine Corps objectives defined by the USMC S&T Strategic Plan. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) is the Marine Corps' foundational Capstone Operating Concept that provides vision and context for developing future operating and functional concepts that in turn guide capability development and this PE. Using future concepts, science and technology (S&T) performers can focus less technologically mature applied research in areas where end state capabilities are not fully defined and on S&T opportunities where feasibility is not fully developed or known but is also potentially game changing. EF 21 aligns with national level strategic guidance including the National Security Strategy (NSS), National Military Strategy (NMS), Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and with Naval strategy in the Department of the Navy's Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower.\n\nExpeditionary Force 21 describes a future Marine Corps ground force that will have cornerstone characteristics of being naval, expeditionary, agile, and lethal. This force will face security environments and threats driven by Complex Terrain (to include informational and human aspects), Technology Proliferation (including precision weapons), Information used as a Weapon, Battles of Electromagnetic (EM) Spectrum Signatures, and Increasingly Contested Maritime Domains. The future Marine Corps will be designed to meet those future security environments but needed force characteristics also impose constraints and challenges on future operating concepts and capabilities. EF 21 provides the context in which promising and innovative applied research is explored to determine scientific feasibility of potential solutions and opportunities to enhance, change, or invent future concepts with S&T. For example within the above naval force characteristics, amphibious operations against EM signature aware threats with advanced weapons systems will be part of future Marine operating concepts. Promising science opportunities in autonomy may enable new concepts and capabilities in agility, lethality, and signature management that have not even been defined. The EF 21 context brings constraints and challenges that stimulate unique science and technology (S&T) requirements and opportunities that define this PE.\n\nS&T projects in this PE explore the feasibility of applied research to meet broad Marine Corps conceptual requirements within the unique constraints described above in the warfighting functional areas of: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver and mobility; force protection; logistics and sustainment; human performance, training and education, firepower, and Expeditionary Cyber. This PE funds applied research, future technology assessment and road mapping, future technology concepts, and less technologically mature projects within the Future Naval Capability (FNC) process as means to inform, enhance, and invent future concepts and capabilities with new S&T.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

FORCEnet is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, networks, command and control, and weapons into a networked, distributed, combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from the seabed to space, and from sea to land. The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with, and among, distributed tactical forces. Activities in this program area provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks and distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detectability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment."

The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval Technology Gaps generated by IPTs that are co-managed by Navy and the Marine Corps flag\/general officers with representation across the naval research enterprise.  FNC funding is aligned to naval challenges that may be associated with any of the FNC focus areas (i.e., Pillars).  FNCs contain both 6.2 Applied Research and 6.3 Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity (BA) components as technology is matured from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.   \n\nThe FY2016 to FY2017 increase was due to a rephasing of the Tactical Edge Enabling Capability products of Actionable Information Tactical Applications, Data Condition, and Network Adaptive Communication Services.\n\nThe FY2017 to FY2018 decrease in the USMC Future Naval Capabilities activity is due to a realignment of funds to the Expeditionary Cyber Activity. Additional funding realignment within PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Demonstration ensures that the Future FNC funding will remain constant in USMC program elements."

This thrust aims at capturing emerging technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Emphasis on survivability technologies includes defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics. These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies. The Thrust is also providing the USMC with affordable technologies that enable manned-unmanned teaming, autonomous vehicle collaboration, and ground vehicle mobility technologies for enhanced expeditionary maneuver.\n\nThe FY2016 to FY2017 increase in funding is due the re-phasing of the initiation of technology development programs to address expeditionary maneuver capability gaps."

Technology assessments are conducted to determine the supporting technologies that have the highest impact across the warfare areas, and warrant further investment within this PE.  Technology Roadmapping is conducted to help identify opportunities to leverage technology development within the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense, as well as, with the commercial sector and university communities.  The resultant technology investment strategy is developed and used to guide out-year technology development efforts."

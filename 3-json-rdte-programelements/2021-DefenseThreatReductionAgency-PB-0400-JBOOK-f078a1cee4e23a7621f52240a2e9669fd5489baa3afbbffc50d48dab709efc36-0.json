This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA\u2019s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.\n\nThis project aligns with DTRA\u2019s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction and consequence management communities. The portfolio addresses this through fundamental research focused on making revolutionary scientific discoveries relevant to emerging and future Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction and Improvised Threat Network (CWMDITN) challenges. Program managers drive interdisciplinary portfolios primarily drawing from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and information and network sciences to:  train the next-generation workforce; advance the fundamental knowledge and understanding in the sciences; promote university research to support the CWMDITN mission; and facilitate transition of research to support our warfighters."

The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; securing vulnerable materials; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.\n\nThis project solicits, coordinates, and conducts research to build a robust, forward-looking fundamental research portfolio targeting strategic, mission-focused, basic research with high potential impact for CWMD. The research projects are selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation.  Each research project offers opportunities to expand the knowledge base to help the warfighter, to bring to bear new science solutions with a fresh approach, or to leverage revolutionary approaches to technical surprise, building a foundation for future CWMD solutions.

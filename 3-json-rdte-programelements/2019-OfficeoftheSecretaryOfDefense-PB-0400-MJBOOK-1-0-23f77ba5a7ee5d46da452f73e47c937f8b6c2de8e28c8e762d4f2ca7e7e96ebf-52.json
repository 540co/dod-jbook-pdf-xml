            "val": "The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. \n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

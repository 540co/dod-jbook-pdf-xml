M-SHORAD provides the Army improved capabilities for defense of maneuver formations and other tactical echelons from low altitude air attack and surveillance. Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten the ability of maneuver forces to conduct operations. Specifically, maneuver formations require the improved M-SHORAD air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.  \n\nThe M-SHORAD capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach with a rapidly fielded Initial M-SHORAD system (supported by an Army Approved Directed Requirement) and an enduring M-SHORAD (supported by a Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved Capability Development Document (CDD) that will field the full capability. First, the Army will field the Initial M-SHORAD solution based on a Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Directed Requirement, which was informed by the FY 2017 M-SHORAD Demonstration. This system will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include FW, RW, and Group 3 UAS while keeping pace and surviving with the maneuver Brigades. The Initial M-SHORAD will be fielded to four M-SHORAD battalions.  In addition, the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) will transition the Directed Energy M-SHORAD (DE M-SHORAD) to the M-SHORAD Product Office in 1 Quarter (QTR) FY 2023.

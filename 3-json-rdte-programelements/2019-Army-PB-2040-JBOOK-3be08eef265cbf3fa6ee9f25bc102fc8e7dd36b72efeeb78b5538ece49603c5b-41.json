            "val": "This Program Element encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for tactical Electronic Warfare (EW).  EW encompasses the development of tactical EW equipment and systems mounted in both ground and air vehicles.  The systems under this program provides the Army with the capability to degrade or deny hostile forces the effective use of their communications, counter mortar\/counterbattery radars, surveillance radars, infrared\/optical battlefield surveillance systems and electronically fused munitions.  Existing Army EW systems must be replaced or upgraded to maintain their capability in the face of threats. Prophet Enhanced is the current system under the Prophet Ground acquisition program.  Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces.  Prophet Enhanced provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack). The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) is a Department of the Army established project to develop techniques, methods, tools and architecture to reprogram mission software embedded in Army EW systems, Force Protection Systems (FPS), and Target Sensing Systems (TSS) in response to changes in threat signatures.  ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within intelligence systems, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop EW Mission Software and Products (MSP) for both air and ground EW systems, 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MSPs, 4) improved communications conduits to transmit mission software changes to field users, and 5) enhanced mission-software uploading tools. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, simulation, mission software development, distribution and uploading of mission software changes directly to the supported Soldier in the field.  The ARAT project will develop, test and equip an Army-wide infrastructure capable of rapidly reprogramming electronic combat software embedded in offensive and defensive weapon system.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget request funds Electronic Warfare (EW) Development for Prophet Enhanced efforts (Project EW5) and The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) efforts (Project EW6)."

The regulatory guidance directing this mission is contained in Army Regulation (AR) 525-15, AR 525-22, and AR 95-1. The ARAT develops integrated technical solutions required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW threats to US Forces. The ARAT reprogramming infrastructure supports the Army Campaign Plan to provide the Regionally Aligned Forces tactical Commander timely rapid-reprogramming capability of EW systems with mission software.  The ARAT mission responsibility is to develop and distribute Mission Software and Products to forward deployed combat forces. ARAT identifies and analyzes threat signature changes which affect EW systems; determine the impact of observed signature changes; rapidly develop new mission software to adapt friendly systems to detect and defeat enemy threats to U.S. Army ground and air platforms; disseminate the Mission Software and Products to forward deployed forces, and provide government developed tools and software to upload new mission software into the affected EW systems."

Integrated solutions are required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW threats.  The ARAT reprogramming infrastructure supports the tactical Commander by providing timely rapid reprogramming of mission software and information dissemination for Army supported, Joint and allied services.  ARAT supports integrated reprogramming of target acquisition, target engagement, vehicle survivability, and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE). ARAT rapid-reprogramming infrastructure supports tactical requirements for deployed aircraft and ground-based (e.g. Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (CREW)) survivability systems. ARAT identifies and analyzes threat signature changes which affect EW systems; determines the impact of observed signature changes; develops new mission software to adapt the system to the changes; disseminates the mission software; and provides methods to upload the new mission software into the affected EW systems. Each element within the ARAT infrastructure plays a specific role within the program's rapid reprogramming process, providing the Soldier with the capability to install mission and target identification software at the lowest possible level, thus maximizing flexibility for tactical commanders. ARAT participates in the operational and developmental test design of Army EW systems, and supports Joint Service Reprogramming Exercises in all theaters. ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within the intelligence system, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop Mission Software and Products (MSP), 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MSPs, 4) improved communications conduits to rapidly transmit mission software to upload into supported EW systems. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, threat modeling and simulation, mission software development and testing, distribution and uploading of mission software directly to the supported Soldier in the field."

            "val": "The Advanced Electronic Protection Enhancement (AEPE) Program funds efforts to assess and initiate development of solutions to Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) vulnerabilities from Advanced Electronic Attack (AEA).  Army AMD sensors, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Command and Control (C2), and Radio Frequency (RF) data and voice networks will be assessed against current and postulated AEA systems and techniques.  Potential Electronic Protection (EP) solutions developed by the Army will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated AEA environments.  Similarly, EP solutions developed by the Joint services and other Agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency) will also be assessed for potential incorporation into Army AMD systems.\n\nThe Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of Air and Missile Defense (AMD) operations at all echelons. AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades, Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCT's), Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions\/Corps. AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems. ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities. They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces. AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the Air & Missile Defense (AMD) Battalions. AMDPCS has three major components: (1) The Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational 3-dimensional air picture.  AMDWS is the air picture provider for the Army, producing an integrated and correlated air picture at all tactical levels and locations. AMDWS is also an integral component of Integrated Base Defense. AMDWS provides an interoperability link to multinational air defense forces; (2) The Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is a communications data link processor and display system that provides near-real time, 3-dimensional, joint airspace situational awareness and fire direction command and control for AMD forces; (3) The Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, Common Hardware Systems, standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions, direct forces, and control airspace.  The integration of the Cooperative Aircraft Surveillance Sensor (CASS) into sheltered systems enables AMDPCS to track self-reporting aircraft. CASS receives position and identification data from self-reporting aircraft, to include UAS, within 250 nautical miles.\n\nThe Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system-of-systems (SoS) is an evolutionary, non-developmental program that detects RAM launches; provides localized warning to the defended area, with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercepts rounds in flight, thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhances response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors, command and control (C2) equipment, a commercial industry-produced warning system, and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)), all connected via a wireless local area network.  The Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, also under the management of the C-RAM Program Directorate, provides the C-RAM C2 functionality and has been enhanced to integrate the sensors, weapons, and warning systems for the C-RAM SoS.  C-RAM C2 software correlates RAM sensor data, evaluates the threat, provides early warning, directs engagements, and cues counterfire systems and reaction forces.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Egypt, providing correlated air and ground pictures to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Networks, and using various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information to synchronize and optimize automated Shape, Sense, Warn, Intercept, Respond, and Protect decisions.\n\nMultiple acquisition efforts are associated with the C-RAM program, including C-RAM Intercept, which fields existing LPWS guns to two Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)\/Avenger composite Battalions, and RAM Warn, a horizontal technology insertion, using current C-RAM warning capability to provide early, localized warning to all Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCT).\n\nThe Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) capability is being developed in response to a Joint Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) CC-0558 approved by Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) in June 2016.  Project FG5 was created to support the identification, development, testing, evaluation and integration of technologies to provide an overall evolutionary capability to defeat small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) threats.  The C-UAS system will provide the capability for the warfighter to comprehensively detect, identify and defeat enemy Group 1 and 2 light weight, low altitude UAS.  The C-UAS system development involves a phased development and testing approach of Counter UAS Systems."

Potential Electronic Protection (EP) solutions developed by the Army will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated AEA environments.  Similarly, EP solutions developed by the Joint services and other Agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency) will also be assessed for potential incorporation into Army AMD systems.\n\nThe initial assessment event was conducted in 2QFY15.  Subsequent events will be conducted approximately every two (2) years. Analysis and implementation that provide AEA solutions will occur between events and will be assessed at the next event after implementation.  \n\nThe following tasks were developed based on previous AEPE demonstration results and the following planned activities will assess the AEA impacts on AMD components and development of countermeasures. The tasks for AEPE are: (1) Plan and execute periodic AEPE demonstrations with Army AMD systems and perform post-demonstration analysis.  Integrate Joint service and other Agency AMD systems into AEPE demonstrations as appropriate.  (2) Upon completion of AEPE demonstration analyses, create EP concepts to mitigate Army AMD sensor, C2, and RF data link vulnerabilities.  (3) Develop EP tools for use by Army AMD systems to improve overall system performance in AEA environments.  (4) Develop effects-based AEA Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to assess Army AMD EP concepts in Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) environment.  (5) Continue to collaborate with United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Joint Electromagnetic Preparedness for Advanced Combat (JEPAC) to evaluate, modify, and field existing Army AMD EP Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a Joint environment.  Evaluate and modify applicable Joint EP TTPs for use in Army AMD systems.  (6) Continually interface with intelligence communities to maintain cognizance of emerging AEA threats and incorporate these threats in future AEPE demonstrations.  (7) Develop a time-phased EP roadmap that identifies the investments needed to improve the EP capabilities of Army AMD sensors, C2, and RF data and voice networks.\n\nThe AEPE effort crosses all AMD System efforts of which only a portion is Air Defense Command and Control."

                            "val": "The Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of Air and Missile Defense (AMD) operations at all echelons.  AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades, Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCT's), Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions\/Corps.  AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities.  They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the AMD Battalions.  AMDPCS has three major components:  (1) The Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational three dimensional air picture.  AMDWS is the air picture provider for the Army, producing an integrated and correlated air picture at all tactical levels and locations.  AMDWS is also an integral component of Integrated Base Defense.  AMDWS provides an interoperability link to multinational air defense forces; (2) The Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is joint data link communications processor and display system that provides near-real time, three dimensional, joint airspace situational awareness and fire direction command and control for AMD forces; (3) The Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, Common Hardware Systems, standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions, direct forces, and control airspace.  The integration of the Cooperative Aircraft Surveillance Sensor (CASS) into sheltered systems enables AMDPCS to track self-reporting aircraft.  CASS receives position and identification data from self-reporting aircraft, to include UAS, within 250 nautical miles.  \n \nFY18 funds the development, software engineering, testing and certification of AMDWS and CASS software; Engineering, development, test and evaluation of the AMDPCS Family of Shelter (FoS) subsystems; and Software system certification testing, accreditation, and approval of authority-to-operate (ATO)."

                            "val": "The Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system-of-systems (SoS) is an evolutionary, non-developmental program that detects RAM launches; provides localized warning to the defended area, with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercepts rounds in flight, thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhances response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors, command and control (C2) equipment, a commercial industry-produced warning system, and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)), all connected via a wireless local area network.  The Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, also under the management of the C-RAM Program Directorate, provides the C-RAM C2 functionality and has been enhanced to integrate the sensors, weapons, and warning systems for the C-RAM SoS.  C-RAM C2 software correlates RAM sensor data, evaluates the threat, provides early warning, directs engagements, and cues counterfire systems and reaction forces.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Egypt, providing correlated air and ground pictures to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Networks, and using various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information to synchronize and optimize automated Shape, Sense, Warn, Intercept, Respond, and Protect decisions.\n\nThe deployment of the C-RAM SoS was accomplished through an incremental acquisition process driven by urgent operational needs, theater priorities, and emerging capability requirements to provide a counter-RAM capability to combat forces.  The C-RAM SoS approach was initially validated by a Proof of Principle demonstration in December 2004 and has undergone more than 25 Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)-supported operational assessments to incorporate multiple improvements in response to changes in threat tactics and lessons learned.  C-RAM capabilities are currently deployed to locations in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS), Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), and Task Force Sinai (TFS).  Continuing C-RAM SoS improvement efforts, required to meet emerging theater requirements, include C2 and LPWS software upgrades as well as integration and deployment of Ku band Radio Frequency System (KuRFS) radars for an enhanced detection capability against stressing threats.  Base RDTE funding for FY 2015 and beyond supports maintenance of C-RAM C2 basic Air Defense functionality.  Support of the existing C-RAM SoS capability deployed in theater has been through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) process.\n  \nRecent directed enhancements to the C-RAM SoS capability included use of Army tactical communications rather than commercial systems; integration of Warn functionality into the C2 workstation to reduce complexity and footprint; and integration with Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) for enhanced situational awareness, combat identification, and response options.  FY16-17 enhancements include testing and upgrade of dynamic clearance of unplanned fires (DCUF) in conjunction with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) V2 for rapid and enhanced response, integration of sensor communications and legacy systems, development and integration of C-RAM network security enhancements, and completion of an LPWS cruise missile capability study and modification development effort.\n\nFY 2018 Base RDT&E dollars in the amount of $4.420 million provide C-RAM C2 development and upgrades."

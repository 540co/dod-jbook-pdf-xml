The initial systems in the DMO\/LVC environment; F-15C\/E, Airborne Warning and Control System, and F-16 Block 40\/50, all required new training systems.  Additionally, the Operations and Integration capability was created.  The Training Simulation Service (TSS) acquisition strategy was used to meet a portion of these requirements.  In the TSS approach, the contractor owns and provides the simulator equipment, maintains simulator concurrency with weapon systems, and has incentives to keep the equipment up to date with simulator and network technologies.  Currently fielded and projected Air Force-owned Flight and Mission Training Systems without DMO\/LVC capability will be modified using FCMT funds to ensure compatibility with the DMO\/LVC environment.  To accomplish this, the Air Force Research Laboratory will conduct research\/studies to Develop\/implement CDS, develop DMO capabilities, validate warfighter seasoning, develop objective performance enhancements, and conduct other network studies."

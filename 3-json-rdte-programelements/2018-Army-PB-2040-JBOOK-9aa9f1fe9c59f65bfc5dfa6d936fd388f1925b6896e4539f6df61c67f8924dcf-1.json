This PE fosters innovation in Army niche areas (e.g., lightweight armor, energetic materials, and night vision capability) and areas where there is no commercial investment due to limited markets (e.g., vaccines for tropical diseases).  It also focuses university single investigator research on areas of high interest to the Army (e.g., high-density compact power and novel sensor phenomenologies). The in-house portion of the program capitalizes on the Army's scientific talent and specialized facilities to transition knowledge and technology into appropriate developmental activities.  The extramural program leverages the research efforts of other government agencies, academia, and industry.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by: the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD; the U.S. Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen, MD; the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), Ft. Detrick, MD; the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS; and the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Arlington, VA."

This Project focuses on the fundamental underpinnings of aided and unaided target detection and identification techniques for land warfare scenarios.  This research enables Army systems that can act independently of the human operator to detect and track targets including clandestine tracking of non-cooperative targets.  Such capabilities are needed for smart munitions, unattended ground sensors, and as replacements for existing systems.  Critical technology issues include low depression angle, relatively short range, and highly competing background clutter.  The resulting research will provide a fundamental capability to predict, explain, and characterize target and background signature content, and reduce the workload on the analyst.  This research is aimed at determining the complexity and variability of target and clutter signatures and ultimately utilizing that knowledge to conceptualize and design advanced ATR paradigms to enhance robustness and effectiveness of land warfare systems.  ATR research strategies include emerging sensor modalities such as spectral and multi-sensor imaging.  Research in this Project builds knowledge for several technology efforts including multi-domain smart sensors, third generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and advanced multi-function laser radar (LADAR). \n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with the United States (U.S.) Army Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC); and the U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC).\n\nWork is this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology)\/Project 906 (Tactical Electronic Warfare Applied Research). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n  \nWork in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

This research aims to generate new technologies for unprecedented battlefield situational awareness and to continue the dominance of Army units during night operations.  To achieve these objectives, IR focal plane arrays (FPAs) and lasers with significantly improved performance, lower cost, and increased operating temperatures are required.  This research has direct application to Army ground vehicles, aviation platforms, weapon systems, and the individual Soldier.  Research is focused on material growth, detector and laser design, and processing for large-area, multicolor IR FPAs, ultraviolet (UV) avalanche photodiodes (APDs), and mid-wavelength IR and UV lasers.  The principal efforts are directed towards novel materials for detectors and lasers, and investigating energy band-gap structures in semiconductor materials to enhance the performance of lasers, IR FPAs and UV APDs.  In the area of RF Photonics, near-IR modeling and nanofabrication techniques are applied to the design and fabrication of IR photonic-crystal waveguide structures having customized IR properties.  This research also is intended to lay the foundation for the development of integrated optoelectronic circuits using active and passive devices and components such as lasers, waveguides, and detectors in conjunction with fiber optic interconnects for the generation, distribution, processing, and control of microwaves.  The fundamental physics of signal processing and noise generation as well as the conversion between the time and frequency domains and the optical and electrical domains in these optoelectronic circuits\/systems will also be studied.  The technical goals are to: 1) manage and control defects in the raw, unprocessed materials, maintaining quality control in the fabrication of the devices and arrays, 2) limit introduction of impurities in the material, shielding device surfaces so that they are resistant to degradation over time and 3) thermal management, particularly as it applies to lasers.  This work is coordinated with the United States (U.S.) Army Communications Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  In the area of Advanced Materials, the research is to investigate the fundamental physics of energy, charge, and spin transport along and across active heterogeneous interfaces such as topological insulators, van der Waals heterostructures, solid\/liquid interfaces, and bio\/a-bio interfaces, and in new materials to achieve new electronic\/optoelectronic device functionalities.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinning to Program Element (PE) 0602709A (Night Vision Technology)\/Project H95 (Night Vision and Electro-Optic Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas.\n  \nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

The future Army will operate in very complex environments (e.g., urban, mountainous, forested and jungle terrain) requiring new approaches to understand, characterize, and depict environmental phenomena and their effects on military systems, personnel and operations.  The lack of a complete understanding of the meteorological aspects of the complex microscale boundary layer in which the Army operates continues to impact our ability to provide predictable, actionable, accurate and timely tactical environmental intelligence to battlefield commanders and small Soldier units.  This Project focuses on producing the foundational environmental science research to characterize the atmospheric boundary layer and deliver novel capabilities and techniques including urban turbulence characterization for its effects on micro platforms and sensor payloads, high resolution urban wind flow modeling for more efficient and accurate prediction of the transport and dispersion of obscurants and chemicals, battlefield aerosol characterization and the interaction between aerosols and meteorological processes for Soldier health initiatives, characterization and detection of bio-warfare agent aerosols, environmental effects on acoustic and electromagnetic signal propagation in urban and other complex domains for improved target location and imaging, exploration of previously unexploited regions of the acoustic and electro-magnetic spectrum, and formulation of objective analysis tools that can assimilate on-scene all-source weather observations, atmospheric composition, and fuse this information with forecasts to provide immediate Nowcast products and actionable information.  These capabilities will have a direct impact on ensuring Soldier survivability, weapon system lethality, effective surveillance and reconnaissance, and the mobility required for future warfighter mission planning and execution operations.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the theoretical underpinnings for Program Element (PE) 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology)\/Project H71 (Meteorological Research for Battle Command).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas.  \n \nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD and White Sands Missile Range, NM."

Technical barriers include lack of methods for describing, measuring, modeling, analyzing and managing the interplay of these phenomena due to the dynamic nature of human behavior and to the situational complexity and ambiguity that characterize operations in the future force. Technical solutions are being pursued in the areas of data generation and algorithm development in these emerging environments in order to update and improve our understanding of performance boundaries and requirements and enable neuroengineering. These solutions include multi-disciplinary partnerships, metrics, simulation capabilities, and modeling tools for characterizing Soldier-system performance, and provide a shared conceptual and operational framework for militarily relevant research on cognitive and perceptual processes. In the area of translational neuroscience, which is the transition of basic neuroscience research to relevant applications, research is carried out to examine leading edge methodologies and technologies to improve the measurement and classification of neural states and behavior in operationally-relevant environments, to examine the potential application of neuroscience theories to autonomous systems to improve Soldier-system interactions, to model the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance for understanding individual differences and injury, and to assess how neural pathways implicated in functional processing can be enhanced through dynamic system interface technologies for improving in-theatre performance and training. In the area of cybernetics, which is a scientific discipline that bridges the fields of control theory and communication theory for the study and modeling of behavior in complex systems, research is carried out to examine the complex human-system-environment relationships that define, constrain, and influence the interactions between Soldier and system. Research efforts are pursued to advance theory, models, and methodological approaches that capture the dynamic and multidimensional nature of human behavior, including the temporal dependencies inherent to human behavior, through an integrated program of research efforts focused on: novel cybernetic models of human multisensory integration and human-system communication; neuro-inspired, bio-inspired, and engineering approaches to computational algorithms for multisensory integration and multi-sensor fusion to enable enhanced and augmented Soldier perception in human-system interactions; new methodological approaches for the design of multisensory displays and human-system communications; and multisensory test bed platforms for examining experimental hypotheses driven by model predictions and proof-of-principle applications of identified algorithms and methods.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers)\/Project H09 (Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance) and PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology)\/H70 (Human Factors Engineering System Development).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Human Research and Engineering Directorate, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Technical barriers to advanced propulsion systems are the inadequacy of existing materials to safely withstand higher temperature demands, the lack of capability to accurately simulate the flow physics and the mechanical behavior of these systems, including the engine and drive train.  The Army is the lead Service in these technology areas and performs basic research in propulsion, as applicable to rotorcraft as well as tracked and wheeled vehicles.  Technical solutions are being pursued through analysis, code generation, and evaluations to improve engine and drive train components and investigate advanced materials.  Component level investigations include compressors, combustors, turbines, energy sources and conversion, injectors, pistons, cylinder liners, piston rings, gears, seals, bearings, shafts, and controls.\n\nWork in this Project provides the technical underpinnings for Program Element (PE) 0602211A (Aviation Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas.\n \nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Technical solutions are being pursued through understanding the fundamental aspects of chemistry and microstructure that influence the performance and failure mechanisms of ceramics, advanced polymer composites, and advanced metals, with the goal of creating hierarchically organized materials systems that possess multifunctional attributes at greatly reduced weight and cost.

As the combat force structure decreases and operates in more dispersed formations, information systems must be more robust, intelligent, interoperable, and survivable if the Army is to retain both information and maneuver dominance.  This research supports the Army's Network Science initiative and addresses the areas of information assurance, signal processing for wireless battlefield communications, document and speech machine translation, and intelligent systems for C4I.  Major barriers to achieving the goals are the inherent vulnerabilities associated with using standardized protocols and commercial technologies while addressing survivability in a unique hostile military environment that includes highly mobile nodes and infrastructure, bandwidth-constrained communications at lower echelons, resource-constrained sensor networks, diverse networks with dynamic topologies, high-level multi-path interference and fading, jamming and multi-access interference, levels of noise in speech signals and document images, new low-density languages, and information warfare threats.  These C4I technologies must accommodate heterogeneous security infrastructures and information exchange\/security mechanisms between multiple levels of security.  The intelligent systems for C4I research focuses on providing the agent technology capabilities that will produce highly relevant tactical events for mounted or dismounted commanders, leaders and Soldiers; improve the timeliness, quality and effectiveness of actions; and speed the decision-making process of small teams operating in complex natural or urban terrain.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology) \/ Project Y10 (Computer\/Information Science Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas.\n \nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

This research also enables the design and use of composite structures that can better address the cost, weight, performance, and dynamic interaction requirements of future platforms identified by the Army Modernization Strategy.  Ultimately, these technologies result in safer, more affordable vehicles with a greatly reduced logistics footprint.  This Project is a collaborative Army and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) effort that includes structures technology research into: structural integrity analyses; failure criteria; inspection methods which address fundamental technology deficiencies in both metallic and composite Army rotorcraft structures; use of composite materials in the design and control of structures through structural tailoring techniques; rotorcraft aeroelastic modeling and simulation; helicopter vibration (rotating and fixed systems); and the design and analyses of composite structures with crashworthiness as a goal.  The problems in structural modeling are inaccurate structural analysis and validation methods to predict durability and damage tolerance of composite and metallic rotorcraft structures and inadequate structural dynamics modeling methods for both the rotating and fixed system components to address reliability issues for future aircraft.  The technical barriers include a lack of understanding of failure mechanisms, damage progression, residual strength, high-cycle fatigue, the transfer of aerodynamic loads on the rotor to the fixed system, and impact of these unknown loads on aircraft components.  Technical solutions are focused on: advanced fatigue methodologies for metallic structures, improved composites technology throughout the vehicle, long-term investigation of integrated stress-strength-inspection, advanced methods for rotor system vehicle vibratory loads prediction, improved methods to predict vehicle stability, and improved analyses to address Army Aviation requirements.  These advancements will extend service life, reduce maintenance costs, enhance durability, and reduce the logistics footprint of existing and future Army vehicles.  This is the only basic research Project supporting investigations for rotorcraft and ground vehicle structures within the Department of Defense.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602211A (Aviation Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas.\n \nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD and NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA."

Work in pollution prevention invests in next generation manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal methods that will result in significantly reducing the usage of hazardous and toxic substances and their associated costs.  The goal is to decrease the overall life-cycle costs of Army systems by 15-30% through the application of advanced pollution prevention technologies.  Non-stockpile CW efforts include establishing the ecotoxicity of CW compounds, environmental fate and effect of CW compounds in soils and biodegradation of CW compounds.  Pollution prevention thrusts include: environmentally acceptable, advanced, non-toxic processes to manufacture lightweight alternative structural materials to enhance weapon system survivability; clean synthesis of more powerful and improved energetic compounds to eliminate the use of hazardous materials and minimize the generation of wastes; and surface protection alternatives to hazardous paints, cadmium, chromium, and chromate conversion metal and composite surfaces.  \n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with the Army Environmental Requirements Technology Assessment (AERTA) requirements and contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments.  \n\nThe cited work provides the technical underpinnings for Program Element 0602618A (Ballistics Technology).\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Armament, Research, Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny, NJ."

Understanding of disease transmission by insects and other organisms helps in developing new interventions to prevent transmission of such diseases. Infectious disease threats from malaria, diarrhea, and dengue (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), common where Warfighters are stationed across all Unified Combatant Commands, are the highest priorities for basic research. \n\nResearch conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas: \n\n(1) Prevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2) Bacterial Disease Threats\n(3) Viral Disease Threats\n(4) Vector Identification and Control\n\nWork is managed by the Medical Research Materiel Center (MRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC).

Because the malaria parasite becomes resistant to drugs over time, it is necessary to continually search for parasite weaknesses that can be exploited by different drugs and vaccines. This effort seeks to better understand small molecule therapeutics and prophylactics, to overcome drug resistant organisms and identify new proteins in the design of candidate vaccines for various types of malaria including the severe form (caused by Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (caused by Plasmodium vivax).

It enables future systems to support and unburden Soldiers by integrating technologies with an understanding of cognitive and physical needs, and the missions of the humans and (non-human) agents operating on the battlefield.  The ability of the Warfighter to command a suite of small unmanned systems (e.g., air, ground, and hybrid vehicles) reduces exposure of the Soldier to harm and improves the efficiency by which a dismounted unit achieves tactical objectives such as securing a targeted zone.  Example missions requiring enhanced autonomy, manipulation, and man-portability include rapid room clearing and interior structure mapping; detection of human presence, chemical\/biological\/nuclear\/radiological\/explosive (CBNRE), and booby-traps; surveillance; and subterranean passage detection and exploration.  Because of their relatively small size, light weight, and service in dismounted environments, small unmanned systems have unique challenges in perception, autonomous processing, mobility mechanics, propulsive power, and multi-functional packaging that transcend similar challenges associated with large unmanned systems.  The Army Research Laboratory (ARL)  conducts research in related disciplines, including machine perception, intelligent control, biomimetic robotics, manipulator mechanics, and propulsive power and drives to foster the development of technologies for lightweight, small-volume, robotics applications for harsh environments.  Machine perception research includes the exploration of lightweight ultra-compact sensor phenomenology and the maturation of basic machine vision algorithms that enable small unmanned systems to more fully understand their local environment.  Intelligent control research includes the maturation of autonomous processing capabilities and the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques that lead to reliable autonomous behavior in a large-displacement, highly-dynamic environment and permit unmonitored task performance.  Research in biomimetic robotics and manipulator mechanics includes the advancement of mechatronic and biomimetic appendages to enable agile high-speed locomotion, dexterous task-performance, and environmental-manipulation; and the maturing of nonlinear control algorithms to support robust, stable mobility. Propulsion power research includes investigations of engine cycles and alternative hybrid energy conversion techniques to provide compact, lightweight, quiet, low-emission, high-density power sources that support highly-portable unmanned systems capable of performing long-endurance missions.  \n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Center)\/Project H54 (Micro-Autonomous Systems Technology Collaborative Technology Alliance) and PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology)\/Project 552 (Smoke\/Novel Effect Munition).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by ARL at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

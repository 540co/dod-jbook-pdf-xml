            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea. This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three \"key transformational capabilities\" required by \"Sea Shield\" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within \"Sea Strike\" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric\/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection\/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization\/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Developed technologies will transition to the Joint Service EOD Program, the Naval EOD Program, or the DOD Technical Response Group. This activity includes applied research in sensor technology for NSW and EOD autonomous and handheld sonar systems to increase detection range and accuracy in harsh environments. Other efforts include mission support technology improvements for AUVs and human divers - such as communications, navigation and life support."

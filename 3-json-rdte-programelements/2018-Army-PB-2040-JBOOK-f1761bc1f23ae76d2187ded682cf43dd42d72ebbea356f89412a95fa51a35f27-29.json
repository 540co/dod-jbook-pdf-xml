            "val": "The Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program acquires and sustains highly flexible, customized, cost effective, common, and simplified non-developmental C5ISR solutions that improve interoperability and connectivity on the battlefield while garnering efficient competition to integrate the latest commercial technology onto the Army tactical network. CHS provides technical support, environmental and evaluation testing, and system design \/ configuration management across Army tactical programs  to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the development of capabilities. CHS hardware evaluations facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across the operational battlefield. CHS creates efficiencies through the acquisition of streamlined common hardware configurations across the Common Operating Environments (COE)s, the sustainment community, and tactical programs. CHS also provides logistical services to include worldwide 72-hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements. \n \nCommon Software (CS) is the suite of systems through which the Army develops, integrates and tests common software products and\/or components used for communication between Army Mission Command Systems and Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Mission Command (MC) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort.  The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems.  The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's COE modernization efforts.\n \nThis program element also includes the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF) which is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of system verification\/validation checkout, testing, and configuration management for the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. \n \nThe Technical Management Division (TMD) effectively manages the System-of-Systems engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts for the continuing evolution of the network within the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communication and Tactical (PEO C3T) portfolio of technology across the capability enhancement packages to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solutions.  \n\nThe MCE is one of the six computing environments (CEs) formalized by the AAE under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative. MCE standardizes end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications. The JBC-P is the foundational hardware element of the MCE. MCE enables Mission Command capability development to echelons from dismounted command nodes to echelons above corps, providing enhanced interoperability, and simplified end-user interface. Requirements for the MCE are established in the draft Mounted Computing Environment Information System Initial Capabilities Document (MCE IS CDD).  FY2018 funding provides the means to continue to manage and develop MCE in concert with CPCE.\n  \nThe Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), one of the computing environments under the Common Operating Environment (COE), provides a common foundation (Common Infrastructure \/ Common Services) for Warfighter Capabilities. The CPCE establishes a Common Core Software Baseline and Hardware Configuration upon which future Warfighter capabilities can be built. The CPCE targets Command and Control (C2) capability development at tactical echelons that span from the company to all Army Service Component Commands (ASCC). The CPCE will be the most critical computing environment developed to support the command posts and combat operations. \n \nTactical Digital Media (TDM) is comprised of photo, video and audio recording and editing equipment that will be assembled and issued as variant kits tailored to unit mission requirements. TDM kits address modernization gaps associated with all operational Combat Camera (COMCAM), Public Affairs (PA), and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) units. TDM provides essential imagery, multimedia products, and live interview capabilities that directly contribute to successful execution of a Commander's strategic engagement and communications strategy across the full range of military operations.  No FY18 RDTE funding.\n \nTactical Network Operations (NetOps) Management (TNOM) will support the development and integration of the Tactical NetOps software capabilities in support of Network Operations (NetOps) Convergence, Army Objectives and emerging Cyber Center of Excellence (CCOE) requirements. The end state program is designed to synchronize LandWarNet, Network-enabled Mission Command, and Global Information Grid 2.0 Network Operations (NetOps) efforts in an integrated and interoperable framework, spanning all echelons of command and supporting the full range of military operations for Army, Joint, and Coalition Forces in order to ensure converged NetOps. The initial mission is convergence of DoD Information Network (DoDIN) functions into a single integrated set of Tactical NetOps and Management software. This integrated solution provides NetOps capability to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Theater network entry point and supports the implementation of integrated NetOps for Unified Network Operations (UNO). UNO will deliver a standardized visualization capability (integrating both Upper and Lower Tactical Internet NetOps) in order to reduce complexity and inform the military decision making processes. UNO will also provide enhanced capability to detect, respond, and restore from cyber incidents.\n\nProject ER9 Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2); Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications - Tactical (PEO C3T) fields mobile Command Post Nodes by integrating supporting mission command solutions in accordance with Directed Requirement with a FY20 First Unit Equipped in order to enhance the survivability and mobility of brigade and below command post formations. On order, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure will replace selected elements of the legacy command post to provide improved expeditionary capability, survivability, agility, and scalability for Corps and Division Main and Tactical Command Posts, Brigade Main and Tactical Command Posts, and Battalion Command Posts. It will ensure information and support systems are introduced into the Command Post through physical integration allowing the commander to tailor the Command Post as missions dictate.\n\nProject EQ8, Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment supports the Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program.  The program leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations.  The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader.  \n\nAs the ARMY's tactical network continues to evolve from a loose federation of stove-piped systems to a single, integrated, service-oriented and standards-based environment, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR) development capabilities must also evolve in the same manner. Today,  UTR is a complex, manually intensive, and time-consuming process. This is due in part to the large increase in network-enabled nodes within the tactical network. In addition, tools employed by the G\/S-6 staff to conduct UTR are designed, developed, and fielded by various program and product managers, each with discrete requirements, developmental schedules, and funding lines. This impedes the G\/S-6 Staff's ability to conduct UTR in an integrated manner. To enhance UTR, we will address five fundamental challenges to improve UTR. Efficient data sharing is a fundamental characteristic of modern-day integrated systems. The ability to read, modify, and exchange data in a uniform and efficient manner is essential to achieve an integrated UTR System.\n\nTactical Enhancement supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Modular Communications Node - Advanced Equipment (MCN-AE), Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Site and beyond line of sight radio systems.SIGMOD Capabilities:\nMCN-AE: Provides Top Secret\/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) communications to Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Signal Battalions over the WIN-T network.\nTRILOS: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS). TRILOS will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) radio verses the aging HCLOS system.\nTROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System. TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth."

CHS provides a coherent migration strategy for acquisition of warfighting systems and new technology through the use of technology insertion. CHS also conducts common environmental testing of hardware items thereby reducing the testing requirements for individual Project Managers. CHS provides contractual tools that enable supported programs to effectively and efficiently establish organic sustainment support for commercial IT and utilizes hardware failure data and logistical analysis to support programs sustainment strategy decisions.\n\nAn Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity firm fixed priced, full and open competition contract was awarded to General Dynamics in May 2003, for ruggedization and production. In August 2011, CHS awarded, on a best value basis, the follow-on CHS-4 contract via full and open competition.  CHS-5 is to be awarded in FY18 to provide flexibility for Tactical Programs of Record (PoR)s to meet hardware and associated services requirements through full and open competition and to provide an agile solution to support COE, network integration activities, capability set development, and logistical requirements."

The CS program is the hub of interoperability for the Army's current C4ISR systems.\n\nFY17 funding supports backwards compatibility with previous versions of Common Software products implementations. Products include Data Dissemination Services (DDS) and C2 Infrastructure Virtual Machine as foundation for machine-to-machine (M2M) messaging, Unit Task Organization, Universal Chat Bridge and Command and Control Registry hosted on Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI). Simply put, CS provides the \"glue\" that makes the rest of the C4ISR products interoperate.\n\nFY18 funding supports any remaining adjustments to ensure backwards compatibility with previous versions of Common Software products implementations."

The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the C4ISR systems, and a core communication component of the virtualized infrastructure and will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command (PM MC) General Services Administration (GSA) engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on a single development solicitation. This strategy is designed to optimize opportunities for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition, and to ensure the rapid integration of new capabilities into warfighter systems. This strategy is also designed to reduce the physical footprint, the logistics support requirements, and to increase operational efficiency by integration of additional system interoperability services which reduce duplication of effort and cost; and allows for development of communication standards across the DoD community."

CPCE will provide Programs of Record a core infrastructure, including a common operating picture (COP) tool, common data strategy, common applications, common hardware configurations, and common look and feel (user interface) that allows rapid development of future capabilities within that construct.  This effort eliminates duplicative or redundant implementations, simplifies future development efforts, and enhances interoperability and data sharing across multiple echelons. CPCE enables Mission Command capability development at echelons from dismounted command nodes to echelons above corps and thus, is the most employed and critical computing environment developed to support the command posts and combat operations.

This cycle may be adjusted depending on many factors, including fielding priorities, effectiveness of backwards compatibility, and time required to develop and test new capabilities. The CPCE is a capability integration effort, based on a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf \/ Non-Developmental Item (COTS\/NDI) software infrastructure package that allows for immediate third party development of warfighting capability applications in support of integrated Command Post, Mounted and Dismounted tactical computing capabilities.  \n\nEfforts are being accomplished through a Commercial-of-the-Shelf\/based product that will provide the infrastructure foundation, along with a mixture of organic Government and industry partners whose services will enhance the capabilities to meet DoD requirements and security standards.  Govt partners to include the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Weapons Software Engineering Center (WSEC), Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Software Engineering Center (SEC), Aviation and Missiles Research and Development Center (AMRDEC) Software Engineering Directorate (SED) and Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  Commercial suppliers are assigned efforts through GSA Mission Command Engineering Services vehicles and Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contracts. Hardware, core software and associated licenses to support converged system architecture is Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and procured through existing vehicles from GSA, Common Hardware Systems (CHS) and the Army Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS)."

MCE is being developed over time, with the initial set of v3 Minimum Essential Capabilities (MECs) being delivered in 4QFY19. Subsequent deliveries of capabilities are expected on a 3 year cycle (FY22, FY25, FY28), in accordance with the draft MCE IS CDD. This cycle may be adjusted depending on many factors, including fielding priorities, effectiveness of backwards compatibility, and time required to develop and test new capabilities. \n\nTo accomplish the goals of the MCE, PEO C3T PM MC architects, designs, and develops the hardware, software, network solutions and capabilities required to achieve compliance with the COE. Primary systems architecture engineering is conducted by in-house Government engineering staff with support from CACI\/Agile matrix elements and MITRE Corp, a Fully Funded Research and Development Centers. Test and Evaluation support is provided by in-house PM MC TMD staff, with support from contractor firms, for preparation and conduct of specific risk reduction events and test events. Developmental testing is being conducted by the software development teams with Government oversight and coordination. Hardware to support system architecture and software development is comprised of standardized equipment and is procured using existing contract vehicles such as Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS)."

TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Site and beyond line of sight radio systems.\nSIGMOD Capabilities: \nMCN-AE: Provides Top Secret\/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) communications to Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Signal Battalions over the WIN-T network. \nTRILOS: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS).  TRILOS will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) radio verses the aging HCLOS system. \nTROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System.  TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth.\nNo FY18 funding:   Testing requirements for TROPO moved from FY18 to FY19\/20  due to a delay in requirements definition and availability of COTS products to meet the requirement."

The initial mission is convergence of DoD Information Network (DoDIN) functions into a single integrated set of Tactical NetOps and Management software. This integrated solution provides NetOps capability to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Theater network entry point and supports the implementation of integrated NetOps for Unified Network Operations (UNO). UNO will deliver a standardized visualization capability (integrating both Upper and Lower Tactical Internet NetOps) in order to reduce complexity and inform the military decision making processes. UNO will also provide enhanced capability to detect, respond, and restore from cyber incidents.\n\nFY18 funding will support the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to include supporting efforts for the development of Network Operations software, enhancing Network Visualization and Monitoring of the tactical network, standardizing data definition and storage to support Common Operational Picture, and simplify planning and configuration process for multiple network devices and radios. FY18 funding will support Program Office Management and subsequent efforts for capability development documentation."

Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to the tactical vehicle-mounted leaders so that when dismounted, the leader still maintains the common operating picture (COP) and has continuous situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and enhanced communications to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight.  Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.\n\nThe continued development and integration of the NW program also integrates applications from other programs aimed at considerably reducing the weight and bulk of the dismounted Soldier's load by using a single End User Device. The NW program harnesses Soldiers' experience in combat operations and employs combat veterans for Soldier feedback enhancing human factors design and fightability of the system. This project funds the following: 1) Incorporation of additional new hardware applications and capabilities into Nett Warrior, 2) Yearly developmental and operational tests of the NW with continually advancing commercial smart device technology inserted, 3) Software development for planned updates, 4) Integration of new End User Devices with the existing and re-competed Army Tactical Radios, including vehicle power integration, 5) Government led integration and system engineering and program management, and 6) Conduct NW Operational Test and Evaluation with Mechanized and Infantry units in FY16\/17.\n\nNote:  FY16 and prior funding for Nett Warrior resided in 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem\/Val) Project S75 (Ground Soldier Ensemble)."

The NW is focused on Team Leader and higher echelons and provides an integrated secure information-centric Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) mobile application-based computation platform with data collection, enhanced SA, mission planning, and navigational aid functions overlaid on geo-referenced maps and high resolution imagery throughout a brigade.  The NW enables real-time ground tactical-level knowledge sharing and command and control (C2), directly impacting combat effectiveness and decision-making.  The NW also improves lower echelon intelligence production and analysis capabilities which are central to efficient and effective counter-insurgency warfare.  NW program completed LRIP\/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&E under DOT&E oversight in 4QFY14-1QFY15.  This IOT&E event led to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision is planned for early FY18.  From this decision NW will complete annual production and fielding events based on yearly development, integration and testing of emerging advanced smart devices to lower cost, weigh and power.  To capitalize on commercial industry\u2019s investment in advanced smart device technology as well as innovation and changes within Army, NW requires annual RDT&E funding for integration and evaluation.  Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures."

The centerpiece of CPI2 is the Mission Command Platform (MCP) and the Command Post Support Vehicle (CPSV).\n\nFY18-FY22 Directed Requirement for CPI2 will leverage existing contracts managed by Project Manager (PM) Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Project Manager (PM) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), and Project Manager (PM) Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) for integration efforts associated with JLTV, Stryker, and AMPV. CPI2 will use a Functional Support Agreement for the prototype development of the M1079 CPSV and M1087 MCP variants. A Request For Proposal (RFP) will be released for a production contract for the M1079 CPSV and M0187 MCP in 1QFY20 with a projected award in 4QFY20 to produce four brigade sets.\n\nThe CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD) is projected for Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approval in 4QFY17 with a Milestone B projected for 1QFY20. Competitive contract award planned for 1QFY21 based on Request For Proposal (RFP) responses and source selection process. This contract will be a 3-year Firm Fixed Priced\/Cost Plus Fixed Fee (FFP\/CPFF) contract for the design, engineering, prototyping, Developmental Test (DT), new equipment training, and Limited User Test (LUT) for the M1079 CPSV, M1087 MCP, and ISC Container MCP. A second anticipated contract is projected to be awarded in 4QFY23 following Milestone C in 4QFY22. This will be a competitive award for follow-on Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) support with Option Years for production. CPI2 will leverage existing contracts managed by PM JLTV, PM SBCT, and PM AMPV for integration efforts associated with JLTV, Stryker, and AMPV."

Today, UTR is a complex, manually intensive, and time-consuming process. This is due in part, to the large increase in network-enabled nodes within the tactical network. In addition, tools employed by the G\/S-6 staff to conduct UTR are designed, developed, and fielded by various program and product managers each with discrete requirements, development schedules, and funding lines. This impedes the G\/S-6 staffs\u2019 ability to conduct UTR in an integrated manner. To enhance UTR, we will address five fundamental challenges to improve UTR. Efficient data sharing is a fundamental characteristic of modern-day integrated systems. The ability to read, modify, and exchange data in a uniform and efficient manner is essential to achieving an integrated UTR solution."

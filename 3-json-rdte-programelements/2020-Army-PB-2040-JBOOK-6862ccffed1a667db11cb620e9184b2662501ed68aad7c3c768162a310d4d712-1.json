The overall objective is to ensure validation of weapon system accuracy and reliability by developing aerial and ground targets essential for test and evaluation (T&E). These targets are economical and expendable, remotely controlled or stationary, and often destroyed in use. The Army is the Tri-Service lead under the Secretariat Reliance panel for providing rotary wing, mobile ground, towed, and designated targets for T&E. The Army executes development of some service-peculiar target requirements in support of quality assurance, lot acceptance, and training and continues development of service-peculiar and on-going target materiel upgrades to maintain continuity with current weapons technology and trends in modern and evolving Army weapons."

Multi-spectral Aerial Targets include realistic surrogates, actual high performance threat aircraft, and virtual target computer models. Current and emerging weapons systems require test, evaluation, and training using threat representative aerial targets to assess weapons systems effectiveness in the operational environment. This program encompasses a portfolio of full-scale, miniature, and subscale fixed wing\/rotary wing targets, virtual targets, ancillary devices, and associated control systems. For accurate threat portrayal that properly stresses weapons systems during test and evaluation, aerial targets must exhibit the flight characteristics, threat signatures, and other performance factors to represent or emulate relevant and validated threats. This Project funds: the long-range planning necessary to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirements; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation, production, and modernization; execution of the validation process to ensure that aerial targets accurately represent the threat; as well as storage and repair parts. The Army is the Test Enterprise Reliance lead for Rotary Wing Targets and Towed Target development and the Tri-Service lead for procurement and enhancement of the MQM-107 fixed wing High Speed Aerial Target."

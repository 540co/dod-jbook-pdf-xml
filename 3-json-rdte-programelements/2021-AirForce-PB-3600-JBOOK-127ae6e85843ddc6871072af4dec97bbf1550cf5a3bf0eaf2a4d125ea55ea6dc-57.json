This program provides funding for the development and integration of EW training capabilities to include: Air Combat Training Systems (ACTS); threat emitters; advanced radar threat systems; communication jammers; command and control and debrief capability; and instrumentation equipment\/systems. These systems and capabilities support integrated training operations for all aircraft (including 5th Generation) and for Joint, Coalition, and Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) training events. \n\nThe Advanced Radar Threat System (ARTS) programs design, develop, build, and test threat systems based on advanced foreign fielded surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar threat systems. The ARTS variants will be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for 4th and 5th Generation aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat to stress their tactics, techniques and procedures. The ARTS programs support early research, studies, technology development, and planning for next-generation threat systems. The ARTS programs also fund development of high-fidelity surrogate targets matching simulated threat systems to stress 5th Generation sensor fusion capabilities. \n\nThe Modernization Range Threats Systems (RTS) efforts fund development of modifications for range threat systems to provide continued combat training relevancy and enhanced systems capabilities. RTS efforts include Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES), Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) system, Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) system, Band Simulator, Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) system, and legacy Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) systems. Enhancements focus on upgrading threat systems to match fielded modifications for foreign threat systems faced by combat aircrews. The Common Electronic Attack Receiver (CEAR) provides reactive training and enhanced debriefs using legacy threats. The Modernization Systems effort upgrades Band Simulator and other legacy emitters with modern electronics to improve threat relevance and sustainability. The Double Digit Threat Emitter (DDTE) effort leverages JTE to provide greater on-range threat density of advanced SAM radars. The B-Pedestal modification will provide double-digit threat capability to Mini-MUTES B-Pedestals. \n\nThe P5 Combat Training System (P5 CTS) program addresses new capability requirements for the fielded P5 system, to include continued operations in a global positioning system (GPS)-contested environment.  This will enable ongoing analyses, studies, risk reduction efforts, and\/or technology development to enhance Operational Training Infrastructure (OTI), such as combat training range equipment integration into a blended training architecture, communication and GPS jammers, weapon drop scoring systems, and infrastructure networks. These enhancements will add a critical dimension to exercises and optimize warfighter training throughout the program's lifecycle. \n\nThe Live Mission Operations Capability (LMOC) will regionalize and standardize training airspace, threat systems, and control centers to better challenge 5th Generation aircraft and aircrew and provide comprehensive training support for warfighters. It will provide a node-based enterprise that integrates all range system capabilities, including pre\/post mission coordination, in a multi-level secure environment to enable blended training for combat and combat support units, including F-35. It will address three combat training capability requirements: build and display an integrated surface and air picture; manage training; and enable LVC training operations.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Combat Training Ranges weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

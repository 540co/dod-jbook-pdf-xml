            "val": "This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME).  \n\nThis Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E.\n\nThe Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD\u2019s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG\/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG\/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. \n\nThis program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E, JASP and JTCG\/ME programs."

In addition, the effectiveness of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene armor installed in CV-22 cabins (due to emerging threats encountered on the battlefield) was addressed by one project.  Other projects improved modeling and simulation tools by collecting aircraft system-level damage effects data for medium-class missile warheads against fixed-wing aircraft, as well as a project to determine the vulnerability to yawed armor-piercing and armor-piercing incendiary projectiles.  Finally, JLF Air projects assessed vulnerability to foreign threats such as the OG-7V fragmentation grenade as well as MANPADS.\n\nJLF Ground projects pursued a variety of lethality and survivability research objectives.  One project characterized the complete fragmentation description data for an MK84 bomb.  Other efforts quantified collateral damage effects from Hellfire and MK82 warheads, developed better methods to characterize blast debris for collateral damage assessments, and measured the effect of bomb burial on collateral damage.  Other projects modeled the behind-armor debris of ground vehicle kinetic energy penetrators as well as anti-tank mines, and an underbody blast vulnerability assessment of the JLTV was conducted.  JLF Ground projects sought to develop materials to better evaluate body armor as well as evaluate various materials used in combat eye protection.  JLF Ground conducted modeling to determine a more lethal mix of 30 mm ammunition combinations.  Finally, JLF Ground pursued efforts to enhance test & evaluation methodology such as improved methods of collecting arena test data.\n\nJLF Sea projects provided various vulnerability results.  One JLF Sea project conducted deep depth underwater explosion testing against a model surrogate to improve submarine vulnerability assessments.  Another project collected test data of underwater explosion bubble jetting in order to improve modeling and simulation tools.  Finally, another project developed ballistic mannequins that provide for real-time assessment of rapid incapacitation.\n\t\n\tJLF continued to support the development of a ground vehicle survivability educational program, including a 3-day short course and the development of formal course notes and a textbook.\n\nJoint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP)\n\nIn FY 2016 the JASP continued work on 37 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiated 18 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E. In the area of susceptibility reduction, the JASP addressed improving the effectiveness and reducing the space, weight and power required for directed energy infrared countermeasures, electronic countermeasures technology and techniques, integrated aircraft survivability equipment, and aircrew situational awareness. In the area of vulnerability reduction, the JASP continued to address requirements for lighter and more effective vulnerability reduction technology (e.g., armor, fuel containment, fire suppression, and aircrew and passenger protection). In aircraft survivability Modeling and Simulation (M&S), the JASP continued to improve survivability M&S credibility, address operator requirements for survivability data, integrate DIA threat missile models into threat engagement codes, improve the assessment of aircrew and passenger injuries, and address M&S requirements identified by the joint aircraft survivability community.  The JASP completed 27 reports documenting efforts accomplished in FY 2016.\nThe JCAT continued to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP continued supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness\n\nJTCG\/ME continued to field critical JMEM products to enable on-going Combatant Command (CCMD) operational Weaponeering and collateral damage estimates, along with support to the Anti-air effectiveness community (operational, training, testing, and analysis).  \n\nIn FY16, JTCG\/ME continued to develop and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness, including target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and Combatant Commands\u2019 needs.\n \nJTCG\/ME deployed and continued enhancement of future versions of its two major JTCG\/ME Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) products, the JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS) and Joint Antiair Combat Effectiveness (J-ACE). The JTCG\/ME also continued coordination and development of a non-kinetic JMEM capability, to include a prototype Cyber JMEM. Beyond traditional JMEM products, JTCG\/ME developed and supplied specialized weaponeering data and solutions for Warfighter requirements. This includes the Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool and Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE), as well as standalone resources such as the Probability of kill (Pk) Lookup Tools, Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) tables, and munitions weaponeering guides.\n\nJWS is the DoD wide source for air-to-surface (AS) and surface-to-surface (SS) weaponeering, munitions, and target information used daily in the U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) in the deliberate planning process directly supporting Joint Publication 3-60 \u201cJoint Targeting\u201d. JWS enables Combatant Commands to efficiently prosecute their target sets. JWS incorporates accredited methodologies, certified munition characteristics, delivery accuracy, target vulnerability data, and numerous user aids to support the operational use of JWS to predict weapons effectiveness for fielded weapons and delivery systems.    \n\nThe JTCG\/ME deployed JWS v2.2 in FY16. JWS v2.2 included a total of 220 methodology, functionality, weapons\/warheads\/fuzes, and target updates. JWS v2.2 included initial connectivity with the Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) Tool, as well as updates to the Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST) (containing building types and a quasi-static blast capability) and other high priority User requirement updates. The connectivity with DCiDE improves both speed and throughput of data. This capability enabled the Combatant Commands to have operational targeting, weaponeering, and collateral damage estimation capability in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training. Additionally, Warfighters were able to put ordnance on target and as such, directly affected combat effectiveness in current operations.\n\nJTCG\/ME continued to facilitate coalition interoperability in FY16, and is currently completing several JWS version releases to key coalition partners in support of current operations under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreements. These efforts will enable the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Republic of Korea, and other coalition partners to plan operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimates, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses. This capability is critical to the effectiveness of U.S. targeting and fires personnel working in combined environments.  \n\nJTCG\/ME finalized integration, performed operational testing, and progressed to final systems verification for JWS v2.3 in FY16, with Risk Mitigation Framework testing and release scheduled for FY17. JWS v2.3 will include enhanced data sets and capabilities with focus on connectivity to other targeting and mission planning capabilities for improved estimates and more seamless planning. Specifically, JWS v2.3 will include new\/updated data sets, new Imagery Interface to implement aimpoint development leveraging the Tasked Target Text Data (T3D) data format implemented by currently fielded mission planning systems. JWS software and T3D imagery interface modifications to support integration of Electronic Light Table (ELT) viewers. There will also be a Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) and Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT) interface with additional capabilities to support connectivity. These developments will enable the integration of Weaponeering, Precision Point Mensuration (PPM) and Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) via Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE). JWS v2.3 will also add the updated Gunship Delivery Accuracy Program (GDAP), Rotary Wing Delivery Accuracy Program (RWDAP), and Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST) v2.0. \n\nJTCG\/ME continued to deliver data and methodology for integration and development of JWS v2.4 in FY16. Enhanced capabilities for data and connectivity will continue for JWS v2.4 during FY17.\n\nJTCG\/ME began to plan and refine a future JWS architecture strategy to enable interactive scene base weaponeering, maximize re-use and interoperability of capabilities, increase speed of modeling and simulation, support future hardware\/software compatibility, and support allied releasability. A key to this strategy is a JWS v3.x prototyping effort initiated in FY16, which will continue in FY17.\n\nThe JTCG\/ME released Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool version v1.2.3 in FY16 to support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01B \u2013 \u201cNo-Strike and the Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Methodology\u201d. The DCiDE tool is critical to the Warfighters\u2019 ability to meet Urgent Operational Needs for an accredited automated CDE tool that both expedites and simplifies the CDE process. DCiDE is the only automated CDE tool authorized for use in the USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM Areas of Operation (AORs). The JTCG\/ME CDE tables are used in every planned kinetic strike in all AORs to meet Commanders intent and to minimize civilian casualties. JTCG\/ME updated the accredited Collateral Effect Radii (CER) Reference Tables for selected AS\/SS weapons, which are the basic data that supports the CDE methodology. Changes included additions for airburst munitions, nomenclature changes, and additional updates for newly fielded\/updated systems (e.g., Hellfire family). JTCG\/ME also developed and accredited the Collateral Effects Library (CEL) Tool in support of advanced CDE mitigation techniques. DOT&E received positive feedback on the use of the CER values as a critical enabler in support of munitions employment against high value targets (HVTs).\n\nJTCG\/ME is finalizing the Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE) v2.0  with DPSS. DIEE will provide both seamless planning and direct linkages between JWS and mission planning systems in operational units. DIEE will combine applications that will allow targeteers and operational planners to develop more rapid strike plans, due to seamless connectivity of weaponeering, collateral damage estimation, and precision point mensuration results to mission planning systems for target execution. This new concept will integrate capabilities of an Electronic Light Table (ELT), Precision Point Mensuration tool (Common Geopositioning Services - CGS), and CDE tool (DCiDE), as well as other targeting applications in what we are calling an Integrated Display Viewer (IDV). Although DIEE is in final development, with expected fielding by beginning of FY17, several Combatant Commands have already committed to using DIEE as their primary tool for full-integrated targeteering capability.\n\nJ-ACE provides authoritative air-to-air (AA) and surface-to-air (SA) weapons effectiveness information, and serves as the primary tool used by the Air Force and Navy to underpin air combat tactics, techniques, and procedures development. J-ACE is the umbrella program that includes both the Joint Anti-air Model (JAAM) and Endgame Manager (EM), which provides a full kill chain (end-to-end) capability. Other Users include National Test and Training Ranges for AA\/SA shot validation and various members of the analytical community for air combat studies and planning. U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) leverages J-ACE capabilities to support of route planning for the execution of strike packages. JAAM supports operational squadrons mission de-brief tools such as Personal Computer Debriefing System (PCDS) and several others. \n\nIn FY16, JTCG\/ME performed operational testing and progressed to final systems verification reviews for J-ACE v5.3, with expected Risk Mitigation Framework testing and fielding in FY17. J-ACE v5.3 will extend and update data sets for missile and aircraft target aero-performance, anti-air missile lethality, and air target vulnerability. New capabilities include the Hybrid Integration and Visualization Engine (HIVE) computer architecture interface and BLUEMAX6 (six degree of freedom aero performance) model for increased aircraft aero performance modeling with Hands-On-Stick-and-Throttle (HOTAS) and display capability allowing for actual flight control of the air craft, as well as increased counter-measure capabilities leveraging Enhanced Surface-to-Air Missile Simulation (ESAMS). J-ACE v5.3 will also include the effect of weapon system reliability on the probability of a successful engagement. The fielding of J-ACE v5.3 will allow greater aero performance options and the ability to estimate counter-measure effectiveness. A key enhancement of J-ACE v5.3 is the continued evolution of the J-ACE architecture to maximize re-use, interoperability of capabilities, support future hardware\/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing. \n\nJTCG\/ME continued to develop, deliver, and integrate data and methodology for J-ACE v5.4, which will provide enhanced data, methodology, and descriptive material to support new weapons in the JAAM and EM. The fielding of J-ACE v5.4 in FY18 will allow for greater connectivity for outbrief capabilities by units, target detection estimation, counter Air Defense prediction capability, and enhanced architecture allowing future version growth and compatibility. J-ACE will enhance Personal Computer Debriefing System (PCDS) capability, and further evaluate enhancement of aircraft maneuverability modeling with HIVE\/BLUEMAX6. In addition, JAAM will include capability to evaluate two sided Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (DEAD); improved target detection capability leveraging National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) Infrared (IR) and Radio Frequency (RF) models; and multiple ESAMS capability. The J-ACE architecture continues to be enhanced to maximize re-use, interoperability of capabilities, support future hardware\/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing.\n\nJTCG\/ME performed requirements analysis and planning for J-ACE v5.5. J-ACE v5.5 will include rotary wing aircraft capability and further expansion of electronic warfare and counter-measure capabilities. User input through working groups and training sessions are feeding requirements generation and planning to ensure alignment with User community. \n\nIn FY16, JTCG\/ME continued the development of non-kinetic weaponeering tools and methodologies. Joint Non\u2011Kinetic Effectiveness is intended to be the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze offensive cyber capabilities, electronic attack weapons, and directed energy effectiveness.  \n\nIn conjunction with DOT&E and the Air Force\u2019s 363rd Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group, the JTCG\/ME continued development of a JMEM process for cyberspace operations, electronic attack, and directed energy. FY16 efforts centered on developing the foundational elements for JMEM production, including weapons characteristics, target vulnerability, and effects estimation tools (e.g., U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s Cyber Capabilities Registry, Electronic Warfare\/Cyber Critical Elements\/Weaponeering Guides, and Directed Energy Effectiveness Lookup Tables). These efforts culminated in an initial Cyber JMEM prototype to stimulate user interaction, feedback, and maturation, while setting the foundation for a full J-NKE capability suite, to include other non-kinetic effects (e.g., directed energy). JTCG\/ME will continue to refine these initial efforts in FY17, with further expanded efforts in FY18.\n\nSince JTCG\/ME products are User focused and requirements driven, there is considerable effort that goes into working with Users to establish Warfighter requirements for on-going efforts and future JTCG\/ME products. \n\nThe Operational Users Working Group (OUWG) is a critical venue for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regards to needed software enhancements and capabilities to support AS, SS, AA, and non-kinetic engagements. JTCG\/ME continued to chair OUWGs, while representatives from USCENTCOM, USAFRICOM, USSTRATCOM, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), USSOCOM, the Services, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Fires Center of Excellence, Service School Houses, the Marine Aviation Weapons\/Tactics Squadron, Operations Support Squadrons, Intelligence Squadrons, and numerous other operational units routinely participate. \n\nJTCG\/ME provided User training on its products. For JWS in FY16, JTCG\/ME supported 23 JWS sessions at 19 CONUS\/OCONUS locations and approximately 340 students. For DCiDE, JTCG\/ME supported numerous training classes to support units in USCENTCOM (e.g., Combined Task Forces, J-34 FIRES, and J2 Targeting Elements), USPACOM, and coalition partners (e.g., Australia). With new versions of JWS, DCiDE, DIEE, and J-ACE expected in FY17, there will be additional growth in training support.  \n\nJTCG\/ME provides help desk and training packages via the JMEM Product Information Access System (JPIAS), as well as product newsletters. FY16 support included addressing over 400 User support requests and developing training aids, such as the JWS Training Tidbits and Sample Weaponeering Problems.\n\nAt times User requirements call for specialized solutions, such as weapons fielded between product releases and need for urgent target vulnerability surrogations to support current operations. JWS is the calculation engine used to develop Quick Weaponeering Guides\/Probability of Kill Lookup Tool software to address some of these requirements. FY16 examples include updates for the AGM-114, AGM-176, GBU-49\/BLU-129, GBU-49\/BLU-126, GBU-12\/BLU-129. JTCG\/ME also leveraged the Collateral Effects Library to deliver 40 collateral damage mitigation analysis packages to operational Users for HVTs. There were seven rapid request target vulnerability surrogation packages (31 target-weapon pairings - filled based on Urgent Operational Needs), and a specialized AN\/SEQ-3(XN-1) Solid State Laser-Quick Reaction Capability Laser Weapon System (SSL-QRC LAWS) Weaponeering Guide authored."

                                                "val": "Live Fire Test and Evaluation Major Test and Evaluation Programs  \n\nThe FY 2018 budget will support the Live Fire Test and Evaluation deputate\u2019s assessment of  Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary reports, and the development of Live Fire Test and Evaluation reports for those programs designated for OSD oversight.\n\nJLF Programs\n\n\tThe FY 2018 budget will support the planning and execution of tests of fielded systems not previously tested under the Live Fire Programs to support DOT&E and operator needs.  New threats, missions, TTPs, and combat environments will create the need for these tests and an assessment of performance.  JLF projects will be defined, planned, and executed to provide survivability and lethality data on currently fielded U.S. systems; improve modeling and simulation tools; develop vulnerability data libraries for emerging threats; and initiate responses to quick reaction requests from theater.\n\nJASP\n\nIn FY 2018 the JASP will continue work on at least 27 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiate about 5 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness.  Improve aircraft survivability to fire by increasing the speed and efficiency of fire detection and suppression systems and the accuracy and confidence in prediction of threat initiated fires onboard aircraft.\nThe JCAT will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness\n\nIn FY18, JTCG\/ME will continue to develop and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness, including target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and CCMDs\u2019 needs. \n\nJTCG\/ME will deploy and continue to enhance future versions of its two major JTCG\/ME JMEM products, the JWS and J-ACE. The JTCG\/ME will increase development of a non-kinetic JMEM capability, as well as the DIEE and Collateral Damage Estimation capabilities. Beyond traditional JMEM products, JTCG\/ME will continue to support specialized weaponeering data and solutions for Warfighter urgent requirements and support Users. This includes standalone resources such as the Pk Lookup Tools, CDE tables, and munitions weaponeering guides. The objective is to provide efficient and effective support to meet CCMD current and future needs for agility in a dynamic operational environment. \n\nJTCG\/ME will continue to expand coalition interoperability in FY18 with JWS version releases to key coalition partners in support of current operations under FMS agreements. Past efforts enabled the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Republic of Korea, and other coalition partners to plan operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimates, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses. This capability is critical to the effectiveness and synergy of U.S. targeting and fires personnel working in combined partnered environments.  \n\nJTCG\/ME will field JWS v2.4 in FY18. JWS v2.4 will include enhanced and updated weapons and target data sets, improved Graphical User Interphases for improved business logic and human system interaction, and improved database designs for speed and updates. When fielded, this capability will continue to enable CCMDs to have operational targeting, weaponeering, and collateral damage estimation capability in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training. \n\nJTCG\/ME will develop and begin implementing JWS v3.x product line capabilities. JWS v3.x will enable interactive scene base weaponeering, maximize re-use and interoperability of capabilities, increase speed of modeling and simulation, support future hardware\/software compatibility, and support allied releasability. JWS v3.x efforts will implement the JEL, which will provide open architecture capabilities. JWS v3.x is the next evolution of agile, scalable capability solutions to meet the needs of the Joint Force in a dynamic operational environment.\n\nBeginning in FY18 (based on FY18-22 increases), JTCG\/ME will have focused efforts to enhance and validate collateral damage. The enhancement will support improvements in weaponeering methodology to minimize risk to mission and risk to forces while not increasing risk of collateral damage by providing foundational data for the development of higher fidelity predictive tools. Specific efforts will generate buried ordnance characterization data based upon usage statistics from CCMD  Expenditure reports, and AOR specific building debris data to enhance and validate current weaponeering\/collateral damage estimation methodologies required by Strike Approval Authorities to make their strike decision calls. \n\nJTCG\/ME will continue to support updates for DCiDE tools in FY18 to support the CJCSI 3160.01B \u2013 \u201cNo-Strike and the CDE Methodology\u201d. JTCG\/ME will update and the accredit CER Reference Tables for selected AS\/SS weapons, which are the basic data that supports the CDE methodology. \n\nJTCG\/ME will field DIEE v2.2. DIEE enhancements will continue to provide agile capability solutions for the Joint Force Commander in dynamic operational environments. JTCG\/ME will continue to sustain and monitor DIEE requirements with the User community.\n \nJTCG\/ME will field J-ACE v5.4 in FY18. J-ACE v5.4 will provide enhanced data, methodology, and descriptive material to support new weapons in the JAAM and EM. \n\nJTCG\/ME will finalize development and provide operational testing for J-ACE v5.5 in FY18. J-ACE v5.5 will include rotary wing aircraft capability and further expansion of electronic warfare and counter-measure capabilities. \n\nJTCG\/ME will continue to develop, deliver, and integrate data and methodology for J-ACE v5.6 based on User requirements from working groups and training sessions to ensure alignment with User community. \n\nJoint Non\u2011Kinetic Effectiveness JMEMs are intended to be the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze offensive cyber capabilities and directed energy effectiveness. Beginning in FY18 (based on FY18-22 increases), JTCG\/ME will enhance development of non-kinetic weaponeering tools and methodologies. JTCG\/ME will continue to develop and mature the JMEM process for cyberspace operations and directed energy.\n\nJTCG\/ME will expand efforts to review, analyze and synthesize offensive cyber capabilities and target data into standardized Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals. Cyber JMEM is a top priority of USCYBERCOMMAND and CCMDs to support their Warfighting Force. FY18 efforts will include increased manpower to further enhance and build upon prototype efforts in FY16 and FY17. These increased efforts and resources will culminate in institutionalized methodology and cyber effectiveness capabilities that will provide warfighters with non-kinetic weaponeering assessments and a common non-kinetic measurement to predict cyber capability outcomes. The publishing of JMEMs, accreditation of non-kinetic capability effectiveness methodologies, facilitation for validation of operational data, and the population of non-kinetic capability databases will help fulfill the Department's Cyber Strategy.\n\n Since JTCG\/ME products are User focused and requirements driven, there is considerable effort that goes into working with Users to establish Warfighter requirements for on-going efforts and future JTCG\/ME products. \n\nJTCG\/ME will chair OUWGs. OUWGs are a critical venue for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regards to needed software enhancements and capabilities to support AS, SS, AA, and non-kinetic engagements. JTCG\/ME will continue User training on its products in FY18, as well as provide help desk and training packages via the JPIAS and newsletters. \n\nJTCG\/ME will support urgent operational needs with specialized solutions, such as weapons fielded between product releases and need for urgent target vulnerability surrogations to support current operations."

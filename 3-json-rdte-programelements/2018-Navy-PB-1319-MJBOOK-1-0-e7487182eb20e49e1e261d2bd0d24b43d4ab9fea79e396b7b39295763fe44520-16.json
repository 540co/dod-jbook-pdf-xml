            "val": "Project 0770 - The Advanced Submarine Support Equipment Program (ASSEP) objective is to improve submarine operational effectiveness through the development and implementation of advanced Research and Development (R&D). In order to provide improved operational effectiveness, R&D efforts are focused on Advanced Imaging Developments and Advanced Electronic Warfare Support (ES) Developments. A continuing need exists to improve these capabilities in view of the advancements in potential imaging counter detection, the need to support specialized missions, and the increasingly dense and sophisticated electronic environment caused by the proliferation of complex radar, communications, and navigation equipment of potential adversaries. Ongoing developments in 360 degree imaging systems and electro-optic infra-red vulnerability signature reduction technologies are supporting these needs.  \n\nProject 1739 - The Submarine Arctic Warfare Development Project responds to the increased threat of naval activity in the Arctic regions while continuously supporting the Navy's strategic objective of Assured Access and Combat Credibility. The U.S. Navy Submarine Force (SUBFOR) demonstrates existing Arctic Warfare capabilities, and operational and tactical proficiency, while developing advanced submarine research and development technology in unique cold water environments, under-ice conditions, and ice-covered shallow water regions during Ice Exercises (ICEX). Tactical Development (TACDEV) ICEXs are conducted biennially and require up front comprehensive planning and work-up training, as well as post exercise analysis and reporting. ICEXs provide the framework for various submarine research and development programs to conduct test and evaluation in Arctic regions or at periodic Ice Camps. Particular emphasis is placed on the areas of sonar operability, tactical surveillance, weapon utility, and other submarine support missions. Efforts include assessment of combat system effectiveness, development of Arctic specific improvements for existing sonar and weapons, development of class-specific Arctic operational guidelines, and the testing of ice-capable submarine support structures.\n\nMajor ICEXs, occurring every four (4) years (FY 2018, FY 2022, etc) include a Fleet requirement to conduct exercise torpedo (EXTORP) firings in the Arctic. A Torpedo Exercise (TORPEX) requires significantly higher level of logistics, personnel, and infrastructure to account for the recovery and transportation efforts of the EXTORPs. \n\nThis Project also provides SUBFOR a cadre of trained Arctic Operation Specialists (AOS) and an inventory of unique Arctic sensors to optimize submarine safety during under-ice operations."

Improvements are necessary for submarine EW and Imaging to be operationally effective in the following mission areas: Joint Littoral Warfare, Joint Surveillance, Space and Electronic Warfare, Intelligence Collection, Maritime Protection, and Joint Strike.  The program is divided into two project categories: Advanced Imaging Project Development and Advanced Electronic Warfare Support Project Development.  Both of these categories will allow for the mitigation of submarine masts, periscopes, and sensors to visual, radar, and infrared detection.  Evaluation of state of the art technology to implement periscope\/mast improvements via EW electromagnetic and electro-optic sensors results in improved capability.  Engineering Demonstration Models (EDMs) are developed, evaluated, and validated in the lab and through at-sea testing.\n\nThe Advanced Imaging Project Development projects include the development of the Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics Mast (AMPPM) which is the prototype for the Tactically Oriented Technology Insertion Mast (TOTIM), that introduces several groundbreaking technologies such as individually replaceable capability modules (allowing a vast array of capability combinations without requiring redesign) as well as presenting live 360 degree High Definition video (greatly increasing situational awareness and reducing scope exposure time.)  Also in support of the Advance Imaging Project Development are; Automatic Aircraft Cueing, RF Vulnerability Reduction (RAS), ONR Vulnerability Assessment Tools, GPS Denied Navigation, Meteorological Sensors (METOC), Passive Ranging Testing, RIF - Spinel Hyper - hemisphere, Anti reflective Coating Spherical Domes, Volumetric Atmospheric Modeling, Low Power Fiber Delivered Laser Range Finder (planned), Reduced Cost Fabrication of Optical Sapphire Hyper-hemispheres (planned), Navy Tactical Cloud Integration (planned), Offboard Sensor Suite (planned), Imaging Buoy (planned), and a Project Arrangement (PA) with Australia covering Electromagnetic Spectrum Sensor System Simulation & Development for model-based mission planning and a Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) covering periscope vulnerability.  \nThe Advanced EW Development projects include the development of: Enhanced DeInterleavers, Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) Direction Finding (DF), High Speed Network, Embedded Built-in Test (BIT), EW on-Board Trainer (OBT), Digital EWP, Extremely Wideband Digital Receiver (NATO Nunn Project with NAVAIR and Australia), Multi-function Modular Mast (MMM) Payloads, Digital Precision Direction Finding, Multi-Functional Apertures, disposable decoy, ISR and tethered Buoys and Antennas, RF over Fiber (RFoF), Human Machine Interface (HMI)Improvements, and Next Generation EW Systems Algorithms and Applications. New in FY17 is the acceleration of support for an EW Disposable Decoy Buoy capability addressing the U.S. Navy Submarine Force (SUBFOR) requirement to provide a Submarine Launched Decoy Buoy.\n\nAll programs funded in this project are non-Acquisition Category (ACAT) programs.  The test articles identified consist of critical components that will be fully developed during Engineering Manufacturing and Development phase into EDMs."

Project efforts develop submarine unique improvements to mast, periscope, and EW electromagnetic spectrum and electro-optic sensors based on emerging technologies that are available from DoD Exploratory Development Programs, industry Independent Research and Development, and other sources.  Engineering Demonstration Models (EDMs) will be developed to provide a realistic method of evaluating the improvements, including deployment on submarines for testing."

Efforts include assessment of combat system effectiveness, weapons testing, use of High Frequency (HF) sonars in Arctic regions, testing of ice-capable submarine structures, and development of class-specific Arctic operational guidelines. This project also provides the framework for various research and development programs to conduct test and evaluation in shallow water and Arctic regions.\n\nIncrease in FY18 funding ($+5.367M) is to fund the FY18 major TACDEV\/TORPEX ICEX that requires additional aviation, personnel, logistics, and torpedo recovery resources than a non-firing (TACDEV only) ICEX."

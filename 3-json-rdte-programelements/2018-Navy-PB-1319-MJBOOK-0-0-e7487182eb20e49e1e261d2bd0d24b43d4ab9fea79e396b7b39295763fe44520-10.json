            "val": "The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment.  These applied research initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.  \n\nThis program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect. Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric stun, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The program consists of a collection of projects that range from studies and analyses to the development and evaluation of feasibility demonstration models. Individual project metrics reflect the technical goals of each specific project. Typical metrics include both the effectiveness of the technology, human effects and effectiveness, and potential for compliance with policy and legislation. Overarching considerations include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels and Human Effects Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged with other performers, reduction in life cycle cost upon application of the technology, and the identification of opportunities to transition technology to higher categories of development."

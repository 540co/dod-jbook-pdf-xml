            "val": "Projects EG2\/EG3. GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24\/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges with a cluster compliant warhead.\n\nThe GMLRS Program consists of three variants: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) which has been developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy. GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production. GMLRS AW entered full rate production in FY 2015. The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.\n\nThe GMLRS program will continue to leverage ongoing Science & Technology (S&T) efforts to extend range, increase survivability, and develop warhead technologies to meet DOD Cluster Munition Policy requirements. The Extended Range GMLRS variant will be a modification of the current production GMLRS and will be remain approximately 85% common with the current GMLRS. It will carry both the Unitary and AW warheads. It will extend the current GMLRS capability to 150 km and allow for potential future growth capability in the payload section.\n\nThe FY2019 dollars in the amount of $154.102 million will continue qualification of key rocket obsolescence upgrades (including the M-Code compliant NAVSTRIKEM upgrade); qualify a new rocket pod in support of future GMLRS production; and continue the design, qualification, and testing of an extended range variant of the GMLRS.\n\nThe United States (U.S.) Army has identified funding in FY2021-FY2023 for the technology transition, development and integration of an anti-radiation homing (ARH) future payload into the GMLRS."

Design, development, and qualification of a side-mounted proximity sensor will provide a cost reduction initiative and improved area munition lethality. The GMLRS extended range effort is pursuing a strategy of modifying the current system in order to increase its range.  It will be a 36 month development and qualification effort leveraging existing contract vehicles where practicable."

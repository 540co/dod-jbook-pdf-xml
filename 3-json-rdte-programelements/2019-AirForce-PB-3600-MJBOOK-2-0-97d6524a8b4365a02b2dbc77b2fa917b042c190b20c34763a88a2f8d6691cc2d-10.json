This project utilizes 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launchers (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs), where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for test purposes thus resulting in a production quantity of 41 CRLs.  Increment 1.1 develops capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and variants, to include Laser JDAM (LJDAM), on a rotary launcher. Additionally, this increment develops the capability for external carriage for 16 LJDAM.  Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), or eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J). This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.  This requirement's CDD was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in June 2013.    \n\nTrainers and Upgrades for B-52 1760 IWBU\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the B-52 1760 IWBU project will update existing trainers or use CBT to add MIL-STD 1760 IWBU functionality to meet user training requirements and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.\n\nB-52 COMBAT NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (CONECT) \nThe B-52 CONECT project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with data and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat awareness and situational awareness to support participation in net-centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system; both of which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. In order to enable net-centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates the following systems: on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions; UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio (for exchanging J-Series messaging within theater); Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link (to support voice, e-mail, and file transfers); and an Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance Close Air Support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and retargeting of Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. This requirement's Capability Production Document (CPD) was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) on 16 September 2008.\n\nTrainers and Upgrades for B-52 CONECT\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the B-52 CONECT project will update existing trainers or use CBT to add CONECT functionality to meet user training requirements and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.\n\nGLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) INTERFACE UNIT (IU) (GPS-IU) REPLACEMENT \nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) Interface Unit (IU) Replacement project will replace three Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) in the GPS-IU as well as the backplane (to integrate the new and old CCAs); the Central Processing Unit (CPU)\/1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics card.\n\nTrainers and Upgrades for GPS-IU Replacement\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the GPS-IU Replacement project will update existing trainers or use CBT to add GPS-IU functionality to meet user training requirements and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.\n\nRADAR MODERNIZATION PROGRAM (RMP) \nThe RMP will support nuclear and conventional operations by replacing the current APQ-166 radar on the B-52H aircraft. The APQ-166 is increasingly difficult to support due to Diminished Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescent technologies; the average reliability rate places long-duration missions at risk. This modernization program will encompass the radar antenna array and up to 14 individual LRUs that comprise the entire B-52 radar system. Development and production of new systems to replace the legacy equipment will be installed on all 76 B-52H aircraft. The RMP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire, to the maximum extent possible, COTS components and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase reliability of the radar system while also allowing the operational command to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of weapons, perform mission-essential navigation, and conduct weather avoidance functions.\n\nTrainers and Upgrades for RMP\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the RMP will update existing trainers or use CBT to add modernized radar functionality to meet user training requirements and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.\n\nLOW COST IMPROVEMENTS \nThe Low Cost Improvements BPAC will facilitate future B-52 capabilities. The scope of work may involve, but is not limited to the following systems\/functions: avionics, navigation, Situational Awareness (SA), weapons\/targeting pod integration, communications, flight systems, nuclear systems, and electronic flight bags. Additionally, this project will develop and integrate emerging technologies for specialized B-52 missions to include Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), targeting, and weapons employment. Continuing work related to the Mission Data Recorder will make the T-1 modification a permanent modification to the platform.\n\nTrainers and Upgrades for Low Cost Improvements\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, this project will update existing trainers or use CBT to add low cost, improved functionality to meet user training requirements and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.\n\nB-52 WEAPON SYSTEMS TRAINER (WST) AIR REFUELING TRAINER UPGRADE \nThe Weapon Systems Trainer (WST) Air Refueling Trainer upgrade enhances the principal mission of the B-52 Training Systems program by ensuring high-fidelity simulators and training systems are available for aircrew members to support credible training, maintain proficiencies, and increase skill levels. B-52 Aircrew Training Devices simulate the necessary visual, motion, and audible cues to provide effective ground training for aircrew members. The B-52 WST Air Refueling Upgrade is a comprehensive project that will aid B-52 aircrew in accomplishing credible air refueling training in the simulator, which in turn will minimize the requirement for on-aircraft air refueling training. To facilitate this capability, the scope of work will involve development of an AoA, studies and analysis, a CDD, or any other analysis or documentation necessary to support the POR. This upgrade will also implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nB-52 RE-ENGINING\nThe B-52 Re-Engine Program (REP) supports nuclear and conventional operations by replacing the current TF33-PW-103 engine on the B-52H aircraft. The TF33-PW-103 engine is increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the AF Propulsion Directorate projects the engine will become unsustainable by 2030. This sustainment program will replace the current TF33-PW-103 engine with jet engines of similar size, weight, and thrust characteristics. The development, production and installation of new engines and related subsystems will replace the legacy equipment on all 76 B-52H aircraft. As the REP brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear hardening, cyber security, program protection, etc.) will also need to be addressed.  Several concurrent aircraft upgrades during the REP may necessitate studies be performed during the program to determine optimal engine installation and deployment options.\n\nTrainers and Upgrades for B-52 Re-Engining\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the B-52 Re-Engining project will update existing trainers or use CBT to add modernized re-engining capabilities\/functionality to meet user training requirements and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.\n\nB-52 CRYPTO MODERNIZATION \nThe B-52 Crypto Modernization project will upgrade the B-52 with Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)-capable ARC-210 radio systems to prevent loss of BLOS voice and data communications capability. \n\nTrainers and Upgrades for Crypto Modernization\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the B-52 Cryto Modernization project will update existing trainers or use CBT to add Cryto Modernization functionality to meet user training requirements and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.\n\nB-52 AIRSPACE COMPLIANCE \nThe B-52 Airspace Compliance project will upgrade the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) systems to meet FAA mandates. Additionally, the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) upgrade will be accomplished to meet FAA requirements for FY20.\n\nTrainers and Upgrades for B-52 Airspace Compliance\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the B-52 Airspace Compliance project will update existing trainers or use CBT to add increased functionality to meet user training requirements and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness and to accommodate the FAA mandate for ADS-B as outlined throughout previous AF and DoD budget exhibits. \n\nThis Program Element (PE) may include any necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nBA 7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nThis project is in Budget Activity (BA) 7 (Operational System Development) because this BA includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The scope of work may include development of an AoA, studies and analysis, a CDD, and\/or any other analysis or documentation necessary to establish a POR. Additionally, this project may include airborne integration experiments or demonstrations of emerging technologies.\n\nCosts include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. \n\nB-52 AMFC Test Support\n\"The B-52 Test Support project will provide funding for the test aircraft, manpower, and facilities at the Air Force Test Center located at Edwards AFB, California. This project will support the developmental testing and sustainment needs of the B-52 weapon system.\n\nCosts include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. \n\n\"The B-52 VLF\/LF Modernization integrates a receive-only, low frequency receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-52.  This project will consist of integrating an existing VLF\/LF terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). \n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the VLF\/LF provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.)  as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S\/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and\/or support for potential impact to VLF\/LF.  Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\"\n\nB-52 Reengining\nThe B-52 Re-Engine Program (REP) supports nuclear and conventional operations by replacing the current TF33-PW-103 engine on the B-52H aircraft. The TF33-PW-103 engine is increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the AF Propulsion Directorate projects the engine will become unsustainable by 2030. This sustainment program will replace the current TF33-PW-103 engine with jet engines of similar size, weight, and thrust characteristics. The development, production and installation of new engines and related subsystems will replace the legacy equipment on all 76 B-52H aircraft. B-52 REP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire engines and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability\/maintainability of the propulsion system and produce additional electrical power generation capabilities for emerging requirements. This Re-Engine Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons while saving fuel and extending the range\/loiter capabilities of the aircraft. In addition, applicable training devices for the engine throttles and engine health monitoring subsystem must also be developed, modified and\/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. This upgrade will also require corresponding modification of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  As the REP brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear hardening, cyber security, program protection, etc.) will also need to be addressed.  Several concurrent aircraft upgrades during the REP may necessitate studies be performed during the program to determine optimal engine installation and deployment options.\n\nB-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) \n\"The B-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) project consists of a monitor upgrade with a 10 gigabyte Ethernet connection. The current targeting pod display is outdated and experiencing a historic break rate. Additionally, the current monitor does not support current and emerging video resolution improvements of the fielded Sniper and LITENING ATPs. The B-52's ATP is now capable of transmitting HD color and video at a much higher resolution than the current monochrome monitor; this upgrade will improve SA and combat lethality.\n\nCosts include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a POR and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness."

The B-52 TDL provides low latency, jam-resistant situational awareness and C2 communications needed to support in-theater operations and missions. This project will consist of integrating an existing off-the-shelf Link 16 terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antennae, and the Group B terminal LRU.

It includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA), utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launchers (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs). Three of the CRLs will be modified under EMD for test purposes. \n\nThe 1760 IWBU project is segmented into increments. Increment 1.0 provides internal and external carriage of JDAM, Laser-JDAM, JASSM, JASSM\/ER, MALD, and MALD\/J.  It consists of two sub-increments 1.1 and 1.2. This requirement's CDD was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in June 2013. \n\nThe 1760 CDD was revalidated as a Capability Production Document (CPD) by the AFROC in February 2015. Development efforts for Increment 1.1 were completed in November 2015 and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in May 2016.\n\nIncrement 1.1 utilizes 44 CSRLs converted into CRLs, where three of the CRLs will be modified under EMD for test purposes.\n\nIncrement 1.2 converts 44 CRLs three of which will be modified under EMD and 78 B-52H aircraft.  This includes two GITA.\n\nIncrement 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J). This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER. \n\nIncrement 1.2 completed Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in October 2015. Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted in March 2016. Milestone B approval was granted in April 2016. An Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) was conducted in May 2016, validating cost and schedule baselines. Long Lead parts approval was granted in October 2016. In addition, a change from Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)\/Full Rate Production (FRP) to an FRP-only strategy with 2 lot buys; 1 in FY18 and 1 in FY19, was approved in October 2016.\n\nUpon completion of JASSM\/ER software development, an interim capability providing for carriage and deployment of no less than 20 JASSM\/ER [8 bay (power 4), 12 external] is planned. A combined DT\/OT validated this capability in advance of 1.2 Full System validation, and Required Assets Available (RAA) was declared September 2017.  AFGSC declared 1.2 Interim Fielding Authorization October 2017.\n\nAircraft Hardware Development: Development of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL per JASSM-ER requirements (for all 76 operational B-52H aircraft) and two GITA.\n\nSoftware Development consists of a modification to existing aircraft SMO and weapon (JASSM and MALD) OFP software to allow for internal and external carriage and modification to ground-based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).\n\nCRL Hardware Development consists of developing Group A-associated interface hardware and two Group B LRUs (power supply and power distribution box). Two CRLs will be modified for Interim and three CRLs will be modified for 1.2 Full system using RDT&E funds.\n\nSupport Equipment consists of developing software updates to the existing MUSTANG to interface with the CRL and the development of additional ground handling support equipment, maintenance stands.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness."

The CONECT upgrade includes the following: new MFCDs, a digital interphone system, on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions, an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR), limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, e-mail and file transfers, and an Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink. \n\nAs the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 IWBU, Mode S\/Mode 5 Identification, IFF, etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT. In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers (using stimulate\/simulate\/computer-based training or a mix) to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs. In order to assist PDM during after-install checkout and Barksdale AFB and Minot AFB units with maintenance checkout and operational training, a CONECT ground station is being developed. \n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. Funds may also be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness."

This program will replace six Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) which include combining three Circuit Cards into one Input\/Output (I\/O) CCA. The Backplane and Motherboard will require an upgrade to integrate the new CCAs: the Central Processing Unit \/ 1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics cards. The Input\/Output CCA will combine the Discrete Inputs Analog, Audio Video (DAAV), Discrete Outputs (DOA) and Serial Busses functionality. This upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU. \n\nIn addition the new GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements: Which include two Ethernet Ports and two connectors on face-plate for future growth. \n\nThe GPS IU integrates GPS Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data into navigation, communications, and weapons systems on board the B-52.  The GPS IU acts as a controller for a MIL-STD-1553 data bus communications path.  The major areas of support include GPS interface control and monitoring, targeting pod functions, navigation displays for the Pilot and Copilot stations, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) control functions.\n\nOriginally developed with a 33MHz processor with 4MB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), the GPS IU has become overloaded as more software has been added to the B-52.  Currently operating at 86% throughput capacity and at 90% memory capacity, it is projected to exceed the designated safety threshold of 95% memory load by 2018.  The GPS IU is also facing parts obsolescence issues.  Studies show that the current spares will be exhausted by 2018.  The upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU.  The modified GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements.\n\nGPS IU requires upgrading to incorporate any other GPS dependent capabilities on the B-52 platform.  B-52 fleet will have the capability to carry additional GPS dependent weapons and targeting pods, and the increased capacity to incorporate future GPS-dependent capabilities beyond 2018.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative."

The APQ-166 system will be increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the current failure rate of the APQ-166 places long-duration missions at risk. This modernization program will encompass the radar antenna array and up to 14 individual LRUs that comprise the entire radar system. Development, production and installation of new components and systems to replace the legacy equipment; to be installed on all 76 B-52H aircraft. RMP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire, to the maximum extent possible, previously developed Radar systems and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability of the radar system and the capabilities for new missions. This Radar Modernization Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons and to perform mission-essential navigation and weather avoidance functions. In addition, applicable training devices for the new radar subsystem must also be developed, modified and\/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. This upgrade will affect all three Weapon System Trainers (WST), the WST Training Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), and both B-52 Offensive Station Maintenance Trainers (OSMT).\n\nAs the RMP upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.), increased radar integration (advanced targeting pod, mission planning, crew vehicle interfaces), as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S\/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and\/or support for potential impact to RMP. \n \nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. \n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness."

B-52 Aircrew Training Devices simulates the necessary visual, motion, and audible cues to provide ground training of Air Force Global Strike Command aircrew members. The B-52 Weapon System Trainer (WST) Air Refueling Upgrade is a comprehensive project that will allow B-52 Aircrew to accomplish credible air refueling training in the simulator, which minimizes the requirement for on-aircraft air refueling training. To facilitate this capability, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA),Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other Analysis or paperwork necessary to establish a program of record. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMSMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

The TF33-PW-103 engine is increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the AF Propulsion Directorate projects the engine will become unsustainable by 2030. This sustainment program will replace the current TF33-PW-103 engine with jet engines of similar size, weight, and thrust characteristics. The development, production and installation of new engines and related subsystems will replace the legacy equipment on all 76 B-52H aircraft. B-52 REP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire engines and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability\/maintainability of the propulsion system and produce additional electrical power generation capabilities for emerging requirements. This Re-Engine Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons while saving fuel and extending the range\/loiter capabilities of the aircraft. In addition, applicable training devices for the engine throttles and engine health monitoring subsystem must also be developed, modified and\/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. This upgrade will also require corresponding modification of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  As the REP brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear hardening, cyber security, program protection, etc.) will also need to be addressed.  Several concurrent aircraft upgrades during the REP may necessitate studies be performed during the program to determine optimal engine installation and deployment options.\n\nCost includes any other analysis or documentation and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 Weapon System.  Cost includes Program Management Administration (PMA) costs, centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

It will mature system level concepts and designs to integrate S&T developed advanced ground vehicle subsystem technologies such as active protection, powertrains, armors, and situational awareness suites into a system level experimental prototype. It will conduct experimental demonstration of closed hatch Infantry Fighting Vehicle and split-squad operations. It will leverage organic early synthetic prototyping capability to conduct soldier-in-the-loop virtual simulations of future combat vehicle concepts to assess next generation capabilities and conduct system level performance trades. The team will conduct analysis based on all the data currently available from the FFV and Squad Centric Mounted Maneuver (SCMM) efforts to inform investments in FY19 and beyond."

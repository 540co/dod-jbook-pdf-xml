When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ATCALS development funding currently focuses on the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System (ATS), Air Traffic Control Future Technology (ATC), and Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON) programs as described below.  \n\nNextGen ATS.  This is the United States initiative for the transformation of the National Airspace System (NAS) over the next 20-30 years to enhance safety, security, efficiency, affordability and capacity, meeting the requirements of all users of the NAS. This interagency effort is designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability to a capability that leverages advances in aircraft Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, and transition from solid-state analog voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange. Per Deputy Secretary of Defense Direction (28 Dec 07 Memo), the Air Force is the Department of Defense (DoD) lead Service for NextGen ATS implementation and architecture development. NextGen ATS will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development. As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned). These efforts will involve aircraft avionics as well as fixed based and deployable air traffic control and landing systems. FY19 efforts will continue to use the Lead Service Office (LSO) process to continue enabling Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) access to the National Airspace (NAS), develop a NextGen ATS DoD Strategic Roadmap, Consolidated Avionics Repository, add new capabilities to Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) software, and outline DoD and Air Force equities and requirements via in-depth analysis of FAA NextGen ATS programs and timelines.  Portfolio analysis will be captured in DoD NextGen ATS charters to guide Services through a broad and complex NextGen ATS environment. To minimize integration costs, the LSO will work with other organizations such as the Aerospace Management Systems Division, across the Air Force and the DoD, to adopt a common framework with practical guidelines to evaluate the validity of NextGen ATS initiatives with the Air Force's mission. These efforts support the development of operational strategies that realize the achievement of valid NextGen ATS initiatives in concert with acquisition strategies in integrated avionics advances for systems such as Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Global Positioning System (GPS) Military (M)-Code, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Data Communications (Data Comm), and PBN. In support of (UAS) operations, FY19 program office efforts will also continue to support requests for implementation of Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) at new locations which will allow UAS integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) without the use of ground observers or chase aircraft.  In FY19, the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) will continue NextGen ATS strategic planning efforts, conduct lead service operational test and evaluation as required, and also examine new civil air traffic control and landing system technologies that may have military utility to include an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Tower System technology. In total, these efforts will focus on enabling DoD aircraft to take advantage of NextGen ATS envisioned efficiencies, developing policies\/procedures to reduce costs while ensuring airspace access, seamlessly integrating UASs into the NAS and international airspaces, improving the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determining future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhancing flight safety. \n  \nDeployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old Air National Guard (ANG) AN\/MPN-14K and Active Duty (AD) AN\/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar and Operations Shelter subsystems with state-of-the-art digital systems.  Due to diminishing manufacturing sources, modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective.  On average, due to systemic equipment failures, no more than four of the existing 14 systems are deployable at any given time and none are fully mission capable.  The current AN\/TPN-19 (4 systems) and AN\/MPN-14K (10 systems) operational availability rates are 25% and 60% respectively versus a requirement of D-RAPCON of 98%.  D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance\/sequencing, air traffic control communications, automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations, and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe and secure communication capabilities (a deferred key system attribute).  D-RAPCON will also be deployed with a fixed base or deployable Instrument Landing System, a fixed or mobile control tower, and a fixed or mobile Tactical Air Navigation system to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  D-RAPCON will support the full range of tactical military, worldwide humanitarian, and domestic disaster relief operations.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) extends out 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) will increase from 120 nm to 200 nm.  The D-RAPCON Capability Development Document was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council on 8 Feb 11.  Related OPAF funds are in PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the ATCALS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current of subsequent fiscal year."

The current acquisition strategy is focused on replacing 1960\/70s era deployable and fixed based equipment with mature off-the-shelf technology with remote maintenance capability while also looking to the future under the NextGen ATS initiative.\n\nCurrent contracting efforts include D-RAPCON development, GBSAA\/NextGen ATS planning and implementation, and conduct of an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Control Tower technology.  The contracting strategy for D-RAPCON development is based on award of a competitive fixed price incentive firm contract emphasizing off-the-shelf technology and maximizing the use of non-developmental items. The contract includes engineering, manufacturing, and development and test with follow-on production options.  GBSAA and NextGen ATS Enterprise Architecture Implementation Tasks are being executed via Military Inter-Departmental Purchase Requests, and Project Orders with various organizations (FAA, MITRE, Army, Air Force Research Laboratory, and Air Force Flight Standards Agency).  The Remote Virtual ATC Control Tower EOA contract will be a full and open competition using Other Transaction Authority.        \n\nThe Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (BM) is the PEO for ATCALS.  PEO\/BM is also the delegated milestone decision authority for ATCALS.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Aerospace Management Systems Division (AFLCMC\/HBA) is aligned under the PEO\/BM and includes program management, contracts, logistics, and financial management support."

Unlike traditional R&D programs, however, the D-RAPCON \"Acquisition Phase\" contract is a FPIF contract with progress payments.  20 percent of incurred costs are withheld until the end of the contract, when they are liquidated.  Mandatory funding obligations and progress payment withholds will cause the program to lag traditional expenditure benchmarks, painting an inaccurate portrait of overall program health."

This effort requires acquisition, exploitation, and analysis of the foreign ordnance prior to the development of EOD procedures.  \n\nThe program also provides for the development and evaluation of prototypical EOD Tier Two solutions sets for threats identified in the National Response Framework.  This effort provides resources essential to the Foreign Threat Mine Acquisition\/Exploitation (FTMA\/E) program that includes; acquisition, inert certification, intelligence and operational exploitation, analysis, procedure development, and disposition of the highest priority foreign threat naval mines.\n\nAs defined in DOD Directive 5160.62, assigns the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) the responsibility of Single Manager for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Technology and Training (T&T).  The Executive Manager for EODT&T is to provide for the preparation, technical development, validation, Joint Service approval, and distribution of all EOD procedures and countermeasures to include; publications, manuals, bulletins, texts, and graphic aids.  \n\nThis program is a non-acquisition program (without traditional acquisition milestones) with on-going, continuous delivery of urgent and periodic documented procedures and publications for mines, ordnance items, weapons systems, Improvised Explosive Devices, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and related explosive hazards."

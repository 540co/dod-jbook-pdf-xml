            "val": "The Tactical Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology Program Element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Aeronautics Technology and Information Analytics Technology.\n\nThe Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications.\n\nThe Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  This project will also develop methods that fundamentally change the calculus of battle including consideration of a mix of assets, potentially disposable or with limited lifespans, with increased levels of autonomy are included.\n\nThe Aeronautics Technology project addresses high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and\/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications.\n\nThe Information Analytics Technology project develops technology for analyzing data and information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal\/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems.  Technical challenges include the need to process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data in tactically-relevant timeframes.  Benefits sought include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon; an enhanced capability to plan, monitor, and control diverse military operations ranging from stability operations to combat; and improvements to the efficiency of core military functions such as national and homeland security, warfighter health and readiness, and defense support of law enforcement and civil authorities.  Promising technologies are evaluated in the laboratory and demonstrated in the field to facilitate transition."

Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long range sensors, MAD-FIRES advances fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs.  MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned.  MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new system and as an upgrade to existing gun systems with applications to various domain platforms across a multitude of missions to include: ship self-defense, precision air to ground combat, precision ground to ground combat, counter unmanned air vehicles (C-UAV), and counter rocket and artillery and mortar (C-RAM)."

Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, marine fouling and corrosion.  The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state of the art.  These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention. In FY 2020, this program is also funded in PE 0603766E, Project NET-02.  The anticipated transition is to the Navy."

The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality.  This project will develop methods and technologies to expand the maneuver trade space to include the vertical dimension, including subterranean environments, and will leverage advances in artificial intelligence to enable integrated manned-unmanned operations and decrease warfighter exposure through the use of autonomous agents."

The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.  The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve unit level overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create an advanced, dismounted small unit."

Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to sense, decide and act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage.  The program seeks to develop solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats.  The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability."

The program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms operating in conjunction with U.S. ground forces that monitor an area overtly to detect hostile forces and establish Positive Identification (PID) before any U.S. troops come into contact.  Military units follow strict rules of engagement (ROEs) that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior. This program will establish a Legal, Moral, Ethical (LME) working group comprising multiple individuals (technologists, military, university professors, ethicists, legal experts) to develop an understanding of how escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. URSA will explore scenarios and probing behaviors that will enable identifying innocent civilians and individuals with hostile intent. This mission will require the integration and maturation of novel sensors, and unmanned ground and air vehicles which leverage current techniques in perspective and reactive autonomy to navigate cluttered urban environments.  URSA will develop new search and probing behaviors to expose human intent and serve as evidence that a potential target is a threat. It will implement new dimensions of evidence such as the human reactions to these probing actions to improve confidence in its decisions, and will build a novel framework for escalating nonlethal force."

The urban environment creates unique challenges in providing solutions for mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and concealment.  Every pound that a warfighter wears or carries reduces their mobility and mission effectiveness, and, particularly in urban combat, reduced mobility paradoxically reduces their survivability.  The Rapunzel program seeks to enable warfighters to manipulate the urban environment through the application of novel materials research.  Rapunzel envisions soldier-borne or vehicle-borne utility-belt style packaged containers, reels, and spools of material that can perform urban engineering tasks such as create bridges between building rooftops, pull down enemy barriers, or provide false targets and concealment.  The program will identify those mass-manufactured materials, such as extremely high-tensile strength monofilament that can both provide novel mobility between buildings but also provide novel counter-mobility to enemy vehicles due to their electrical conductance properties. The Rapunzel program will leverage extensive existing research into early developmental materials and invest in the task-based development and packing to provide these materials at appropriate length and size scales for immediate tactical use."

Based on this knowledge, the tactical decision engine will establish a contextually-relevant personalized operating picture for each node\/individual in accordance with their current status and mission goal and then guide action (e.g. heading and urgency) via interface modalities appropriate to the current state. 3HNDRED will assess and integrate hands-free, heads-up interfaces to convey information to the warfighter that can be quickly detected and intuitively understood without cognitive burden, enabling rapid response. 3HNDRED will enable collaborative actions between dismounted and mounted elements across manned and unmanned teams, and support on-the-fly force re-composition, providing an asymmetric advantage to U.S. ground forces."

The DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC) are fundamentally limited by a shortage of expert data scientists to construct empirical models that predict behaviors and anticipate contingencies during tactical and strategic planning.  D3M will address this need by creating technologies that automate the construction of complex empirical models.  D3M technologies will include a library of data modeling primitives that are automatically selectable; automated approaches for composition of complex models from modeling primitives; and intuitive mechanisms for human-model interaction that enable curation of models by non-experts.

Earlier search technologies were limited in search query format, retrieved content organization, and infrastructure support, and they imposed an iterative search process that was time-consuming and inefficient, producing only a fraction of the available information. Memex created a new domain-specific search paradigm that discovers relevant content and organizes it in ways that are more immediately useful to specific missions and tasks. In addition, Memex domain-specific search engines extend the reach of current search capabilities to the deep web and non-traditional content. Memex technologies enable the military, government, and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical information on the Internet and in large intelligence repositories. Mission areas addressed by Memex included counter-terrorism, counter-drug, anti-money-laundering, and anti-human-trafficking, with transition partners from DoD and other U.S. Government activities."

U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, and these attacks are typically handled by individual organizations as they occur. Analyzing network summary data across a wide array of networks can make it possible to identify trends and patterns visible only when the data is viewed as a whole. Network Defense developed novel algorithms and analysis tools that enable a big picture approach for identifying illicit behavior in networks. This analysis and subsequent feedback to system administrators, security engineers, and decision makers can enhance information security in both the government and commercial sectors."

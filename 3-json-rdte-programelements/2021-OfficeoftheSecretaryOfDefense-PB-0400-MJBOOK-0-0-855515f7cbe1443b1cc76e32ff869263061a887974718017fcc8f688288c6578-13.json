            "val": "The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)\/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, advanced and disruptive explosive, fuzing, weapons effects, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable significant improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment.  The DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched, at a minimum, dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD\u2019s relatively small investment leverages DOE\u2019s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services\u2019 needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.\n\nThe JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers that develop technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of munitions laboratory technical directors and senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, OUSD, DOE, and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  Projects are organized in five Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD gaps, needs, and challenges.  The The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 600 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 30 current projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success."

These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions and system design and evaluation, including evaluation of lethality, vulnerability and the design of energetic materials (EM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and more thermally stable explosives, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, formulation, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.\n\nThe JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.\n\nEach of the 30 projects has a detailed five year plan with objectives, tasks, deliverables and milestones that is approved annually by a group of 20-plus SES members from the DoD munitions laboratories."

Air Force has a comprehensive and deliberative planning process to identify and fund research that is expected to have the greatest benefit to the Air Force and the warfighter.  10 U.S.C. Section 2363 provides the Commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in consultation with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Executive, a degree of flexibility to rapidly exploit scientific breakthroughs or respond to emerging threats, to include developing a skilled workforce and necessary infrastructure.  This flexibility increases the rate of innovation and accelerates the development and fielding of needed military capabilities to address current and future problems.  \n\nThe Air Force has established PE 0602212F, where the 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 funds are internally reprogrammed to this program element in the year of execution after receipt of the appropriation. This allows increased transparency to Congress on 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 funding and additional execution flexibility for 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 activities to cross all technology areas.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

Naval Warfare Development Command (NWDC) also manages the Fleet Experimentation program (formerly Sea Trial).  In FY2019 the project will execute a number of new experimentations in the areas of Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW), Mine Warfare, Naval Integrated Fires, and Unmanned systems and conduct experiments (war simulations, Modeling & Simulation (M&S), at-sea events) to develop emerging Naval concepts.\n\nThe ACIID project (0798), now called ACME, promotes interoperability with allied and coalition forces by facilitating maritime interoperability in both processes and communication systems, including emerging capabilities, to counter growing high-end asymmetric threats. \n\nThe SEW Engineering project (2144) is a systems engineering non-acquisition program to develop, test, implement Technical Authority (TA) products, and validate Naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System architectures to support naval, Joint and Coalition missions across normal, contested, and degraded cyber\/operational environments.  The objective of this project is carried out by multiple tasks that ensure development and delivery of naval Information Warfare (IW) capabilities that are well-integrated, interoperable, secure, and resilient to meet validated warfighting requirements.  \n\nThe Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Architecture project (2147) is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE). This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR Program of Record (PoR) progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture."

The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACME program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy (USN) expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Mission Partner Environment\/ Future Mission Networking (MPE\/FMN), the U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System - eXtended (BICES-X), and with the Joint Information Environment (JIE).\nCurrently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied\/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Denied, Degraded, Intermittent and Low-bandwidth (DDIL) operations, and to counter Anti-Access Area Denial (A2\/AD) threats. Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich IW data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA\/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, to include Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities as well as Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in secure data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements."

These engineering artifacts provide Navy specific guidance to drive common and consistent implementation of security controls across current and future Navy Programs of Record\/projects. This eliminates redundancies and inefficiencies characteristic of previous stove-pipe development efforts in which each system addressed security individually. These efforts enable a standardized approach to move out faster to improve the Navy's cyber resiliency. \n\n(2) Provide the cybersecurity vulnerability and functional test capability which supports cybersecurity test requirements and the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) components of USS Secure. USS Secure is a cyber assessment program within the Navy. This System of Systems (SoS) (Afloat, Aloft, C4I & Shore) capability in a test laboratory environment provides a rapidly re-configurable capability that integrates maritime hardware systems into a virtual platform. This platform level SoS provides cybersecurity research, development, test and evaluation, and training, not otherwise possible. This combination of Systems Commands (SYSCOM) laboratories, cyber ranges, and Red Teams simulating Navy platforms in operational maritime environments is critical for effectively evaluating cyber threats against specified mission threads.\n\n(3) Define an integrated Enterprise Architecture to support design, development and delivery of integrated Navy Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System capabilities. This architecture reflects current (as-is) and future (target) end states to support technical analyses, program planning, and enterprise-level investment decisions across IW capabilities. Perform mission based system of systems analysis to ensure integration and interoperability, and validate end-to-end warfighting capabilities to quickly address emerging threats. \n\n(4) Provides engineering tools and processes to drive rigorous Systems Engineering discipline across the acquisition lifecycle to support rapid development and delivery of secure and interoperable C4ISR, Business IT, and Space Systems capabilities that meet Fleet requirements. Conduct Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) to provide independent, objective assessments of technical maturity and compliance with applicable architectures, specifications and standards across IW capabilities. \n\n(5) The Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration, eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX) provides a means to demonstrate and evaluate the interoperability of United States (US), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and coalition information sharing systems."

They also serve as a means to influence and drive Programs of Record (PoR) toward a common, more efficient state that promotes interoperability and security.\n\nThe Naval Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Reference Architecture project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment and Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment and Space & Naval Warfare Systems Command-wide Enterprise Architecture policies. This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR PoR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture. These efforts will help reduce Information Technology\/ISR infrastructure complexity and variances, making it easier to manage, operate and defend our ISR capabilities, and help inform investment decisions across the Navy's ISR enterprise to support Assured Command and Control, Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires.\n\nThis effort will encompass the documentation and analysis of current ISR enterprise architectures to inform and guide requirements for target architecture development and performance requirements to support full use and incorporation of ISR capabilities to advance Navy operations afloat. The associated studies will produce both technical and non-technical implementation guidance across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities spectrum."

The priorities for the CG\/CD program are to develop concept\/concept of operations and explore near\/far-term technological and non-technological solutions to war fighting gaps across all naval warfare areas. The associated experimentation efforts include planning, systems engineering and integration, modeling and simulation support, event execution, data collection, analysis, and assessment for a wide-range of experimentation efforts including the examination of prototypes, tactical development and evaluation, support for Science and Technology (S&T) innovation, and program of record system development; venues such as workshops, seminars, war games, limited objective experiments, limited technical experiments, and live at-sea events are used to execute these experimentation efforts.\n(2) Provides naval warfare subject matter expertise, experiment planning expertise, and analysis expertise who plans, executes, and assesses experimentation for the fleets and warfighting development centers (WDC) at the operational and tactical levels. This includes a focus on WDC integration role, maritime command and control (C2), advanced cross-domain warfighting, and maritime operations centers (MOCS)\/operational level of war (OLW) lines of operations. Seeks to solve fleet-identified warfighting gaps (referenced within the Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL), Urgent Operational Needs Statements (UONS), Fleet Commander's Guidance, etc.). The experimentation and prototyping efforts support the \"last tactical mile\" of many Navy S&T programs by supporting those programs where the technology is mature enough, but requires evaluation on or by a \"fleet asset\" - ships, airplanes, submarines, and sailors.\n(3) Provides modeling and simulation (M&S) support to Navy experimentation efforts. M&S is used to stimulate decision making during seminar-style and system war gaming experiments and provides the simulated operational environment and capabilities with high-fidelity models such as the Joint Semi-Automated Force (JSAF) program. Additionally, where applicable, the Navy Simulation System (NSS) \"Monte Carlo\" model is also used to give high confidence solutions and outcomes to complex warfighting problems.\n(4) Provides for focused, solution-driven tactics development and evaluation through experimentation. This effort is focused on developing near-term doctrine solutions to address specific fleet-identified tactical issues.\n\nMaritime Concept Generation and Concept Development products include:\n- Enabling concepts\n- Concepts of operations (CONOPS)\n- Final experiment reports (including findings, insights, and recommendations and DOTMLPF change recommendations and plans for action)\n- Experiment Analysis Summary Reference Documents\n- New\/revised doctrinal and Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures publications\n- White papers (think pieces) intended to generate further discussion within Navy leadership\nSpecific products are listed in the Accomplishments\/Plans section of this exhibit."

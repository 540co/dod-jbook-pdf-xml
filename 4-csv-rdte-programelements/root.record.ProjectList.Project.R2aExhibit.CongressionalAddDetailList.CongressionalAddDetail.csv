This research utilized earlier investments by DARPA that explored technologies to discover, optimize, and deliver antibodies as a means to provide fast-acting protection against infectious diseases.  A key component of this program was not only identifying effective antibodies to treat and prevent disease, but also defining and developing the antibody gene blueprint for transfer and production of vaccines.  The Ebola Response and Preparedness Congressional Add is non-OCO emergency funding.  -  Conducted dose escalation study for encoded Ebola vaccine in human safety trial. -  Demonstrated rapid discovery of potent antibodies from human Ebola survivors. -  Evaluated protective efficacy of encoded Ebola antibodies in small and large animal models. -  Tested protective efficacy of encoded Ebola vaccine in small and large animal models. -  Validated cell-free production of nucleic acid-encoded antibody and vaccine formulations.","","","2017-BASE_RDTE-2017-DARPA-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency_PB_2017.zzz_unzipped-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency_PB_2017.xml","27dc4dbfe68297ff017dce8ffe857930814d9aa2a6d41381d5e44dcecdcfee8f","0-6fe65eb202d69d113d624b8d9103b33cfeb6cc2379cc0286c600c45a78826db6","0-df6f60d76c3127eb67da676a4a05342e7ca91a53e99624848a4d8e708c2a8335","root.record.ProjectList.Project"

The effort with Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC) continued.  Expansion of SPEAR database:  This database will help consolidate research done by the University of Pittsburgh and enable efficient and consistent data collection across the USSOCOM Enterprise Human Performance Program.  This data collection on each individual type of SOF Operator will allow the Human Performance Program to effectively provide consistent and valid research-based injury prevention and performance optimization solutions that will enable the design of training programs uniquely tailored to the needs of special operators in the most productive and cost effective manner possible.  Completion of this work for each SOF Component will also fill in the gaps of previously funded scientific research.  Close Quarters Combat Performance Metrics (CQC):  Development of cognitive and physiological metrics to measure performance in a specific USSOCOM Operators task: Close Quarters Combat (CQC).  Further, this work will improve the operational effectiveness of the Human Performance Program by developing measures of physiological and tactical individual and team performance in order to mitigate errors and improve cognitive performance in a CQC task using Navy Special Warfare (NSW) Operators.  SOF Operator Availability & Performance Optimization: For research to maximize SOF Operator readiness and availability:  This work will identify strategies to maximize mean time between injuries and minimize mean time to repair, so as to maximize SOF Operator availability and performance.  Analyses of Operator injury history and Human Performance Program participation will attempt to identify ways to increase individual Operator availability so as to contribute to increase readiness for SOF units.","0.000","N/A","2017-BASE_RDTE-2017-NAVY_BA7-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Navy_PB_2017.zzz_unzipped-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Navy_PB_2017.xml","05c42a27c83c1e98c7639a612944e49eb9c144a82bca124d914613bd70a16603","1-3e594c4ca643df591403253a06639c934f3361d9ac2036f75c6c494e057d0682","1-baa30fe94827f4ce7c7eafd8a8aeb9f64054b47da4454814d3aac272588fdace","root.record.ProjectList.Project"

However, previous year (FY 2015) language stated:  The agreement includes $10,000,000 above the budget request for a regionally focused technology transfer innovation pilot program.  The agreement directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) to conduct a pilot program on public-private technology transfer ventures between Department of Defense research and development centers and regionally focused technology incubators, with the goal of increasing the commercialization of intellectual property developed in the Department's research and development enterprise in support of critical cross-service technological needs such as energetics, unmanned systems, and rapid prototyping.  Technology incubator partners should be selected through full and open competition emphasizing strong business plans, demonstrated expertise in mentorship and commercialization, and strong regional partnerships.  This language does not replace the report language on Technology Transfer included under Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force in Senate Report 113-211.  The add was transferred to the US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) for execution.

"Defense Technology Transfer Program","2.000","There was no language associated with the $2.000M add for FY 2016.  However, previous year (FY 2015) language stated:  The agreement includes $10,000,000 above the budget request for a regionally focused technology transfer innovation pilot program.  The agreement directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) to conduct a pilot program on public-private technology transfer ventures between Department of Defense research and development centers and regionally focused technology incubators, with the goal of increasing the commercialization of intellectual property developed in the Department's research and development enterprise in support of critical cross-service technological needs such as energetics, unmanned systems, and rapid prototyping.  Technology incubator partners should be selected through full and open competition emphasizing strong business plans, demonstrated expertise in mentorship and commercialization, and strong regional partnerships.  This language does not replace the report language on Technology Transfer included under Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force in Senate Report 113-211.  The add was transferred to the US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) for execution. AMRDEC has drafted the Partnership Intermediary Agreement Work Description, the topic of which is “Technology Transfer, Avionics Technology, and Teaming for Future Tactical Operations Challenges.” This will be applied to both aviation and unmanned platforms and will be competed amongst a variety of institutions, including those in academia.","","","2018-BASE_RDTE-2018-OSD-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Office_of_the_Secretary_Of_Defense_PB_2018.zzz_unzipped-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Office_of_the_Secretary_Of_Defense_PB_2018.xml","94de4a2611763ac6a4a7ce9b466b0da0beec0ae9e7b6d15986b9c43c6f0b6c08","0-de4c0a61ee86c1c363ba014538eed7b53f8de5a6d04ff2284d62f471ae67f294","0-570f7963f48e8d5eb03755055069d6a9c8d904cd6064d8375bc92a83afd7d293","root.record.ProjectList.Project"

"Program Increase","12.071","Research conducted under this Project includes advanced technology programs sponsored and managed from both the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory/Futures Directorate (MCWL/FD).  ONR is funding the development and demonstration of a variant of the 81mm Advanced Capability Extended Range Mortar (ACERM) with improved size, weight, power and cost (SWAP-C) through the insertion of an optimized actuator.  The ACERM technology enhances the mission effectiveness of USMC infantry forces through a significant increase in maximum range, while providing a first round on target capability against both stationary and moving targets while minimizing the relative increase in unit cost.  In addition, the development of a Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition (CDAEM) payload will be developed for the 155mm Moving Target Artillery Round (MTAR).  The capability will greatly enhance the USMC's ability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize, and/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area when there is a lack of precise target location, as is often the case with moving forces, counter fire missions, or when threat forces employ battlefield obscurants.  MCWL/FD is sponsoring experiments to determine the military utility of small tactical autonomous unmanned ground vehicle systems to support logistics, fires and maneuver.  Funds support the development and demonstration of tactical ground robotic vehicle systems as well as autonomy and perception algorithms utilizing a common ground control system.  The capability will greatly enhance the tactical effectiveness, survivability, and lethality of tactical infantry formations in close combat operating environments.","0.000","N/A","2020-BASE_RDTE-2020-NAVY_BA1_3-U_RDTE_JustificationBook_Navy_PB_2020.zzz_unzipped-U_RDTE_JustificationBook_Navy_PB_2020.xml","c3c343ec955dd9070627cacf77444e149bc4c16737ae2fe56d8444818c71fc12","0-778221caff83f95ede93f5f2c131f95df0357cb2c3e3454a6440fa128ff9e406","3-fa5d331f78b4f771ea170627a0ade825ceba1a0b3d0299a96aa13b003954a23c","root.record.ProjectList.Project"

The ACERM technology enhances the mission effectiveness of USMC infantry forces through a significant increase in maximum range, while providing a first round on target capability against both stationary and moving targets while minimizing the relative increase in unit cost.  In addition, the development of a Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition (CDAEM) payload will be developed for the 155mm Moving Target Artillery Round (MTAR).  The capability will greatly enhance the USMC's ability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize, and/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area when there is a lack of precise target location, as is often the case with moving forces, counter fire missions, or when threat forces employ battlefield obscurants.  MCWL/FD is sponsoring experiments to determine the military utility of small tactical autonomous unmanned ground vehicle systems to support logistics, fires and maneuver.  Funds support the development and demonstration of tactical ground robotic vehicle systems as well as autonomy and perception algorithms utilizing a common ground control system.  The capability will greatly enhance the tactical effectiveness, survivability, and lethality of tactical infantry formations in close combat operating environments.","0.000","N/A","2020-BASE_RDTE-2020-NAVY_BA7-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Navy_PB_2020.zzz_unzipped-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Navy_PB_2020.xml","4e316f4c511256add9aac593b955d9dac3c10c0fda13311541e765941d63424b","0-fc95df5bfe77049243f066e408abfe95e0f5d078755f5a650b2049ab8535962b","3-30dbeafcddc992b817523dee8644b4f8d42b5ba57b5a56a374298b3b29efedca","root.record.ProjectList.Project"

"Joint Artificial Intelligence Center","0.000","NA","12.970","JAIC will use rapid prototype sprints to field increasing predictive maintenance capability for the H-60 helicopter fleet across the Joint Force. JAIC will use data aggregation, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive analytics algorithms to detect, correlate, and predict component failure and optimize supply chain solutions. This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive algorithms into the maintenance and supply business processes of H-60 fleet management, utilizing Joint Force readiness and supply data to process at machine speed versus human speed.  JAIC will also use rapid prototype sprints to field capability to the Joint Force that enables better response to natural disasters, particularly those caused by wildfires and flooding, both common worldwide. Computer vision and algorithms will not only reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data, but provide insights and capability that humans alone currently do not have the capacity to manage. JAIC will develop algorithms focused on ISR and geospatial data to develop baseline GEOINT and infrastructure, then analyze changes to that baseline to best provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief. This will aid in the more efficient, effective, and quick recovery of distressed humans, identify damage to infrastructure, and assist relief efforts or evacuation and aid response. Overall, this effort will reduce risk to human life, critical infrastructure, and improve U.S. response in times of regional or global crises. This effort will integrate AI and ML to provide actionable intelligence and enhance military decision-making by providing algorithms for predictive algorithms, computer vision to identify critical information requirements, and user alerts. The JAIC will create a Joint Common Foundation (JCF) platform that will be crucial to the development, testing, and fielding of AI capabilities to the Department. This JCF will contain shared common components providing NMIs/CMIs and the Department with the packages, frameworks, software, tools necessary to accelerate the adoption of AI-enabled capabilities. This includes the build out of AI platforms in a secure protected enclave hosted in a multi-cloud/multi-domain environment which provides NMIs/CMIs with compute, storage and security. The JCF platform supports scalable delivery of novel, impactful AI capability across DoD through the use of several key infrastructure elements. This infrastructure/environment will support each stage of the applied AI lifecycle, including: prototyping, integration, scaling, and support. The common foundation includes shared data, reusable tools, frameworks and standards, in addition to cloud and edge services.  As the JAIC scales and the common foundation develops, entities across DOD will be able to both use and contribute to the infrastructure, leveraging the “factory” of artifacts. This will be done in collaboration with industry and government partners, including technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and across the Department. The JCF platform will promote information sharing and integration with Programs of Record by facilitating rapid deployment of AI capabilities into operational environments, military platforms and IT systems.  JAIC will establish its Tier 2 (Mission/Business Processes) and Tier 3 (IS and PIT Systems)  RMF governance structure to comply with DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT) and DoDI 8500.01,  Cybersecurity.

"Program Increase","6.000","Navy Ship & Industrial Base Sector  Propulsion Foundry Improvement: This effort addresses a critical issue by maintaining a unique and vital manufacturing capability at the only U.S. commercial producer of critical propulsors.  In 2014, the producer announced it was preparing to close its facility and relocate operations OCONUS.  Investing in casting equipment allows the producer to develop additional skills, which should drive revenue and increase the foundry's utilization rate.  Keeping the U.S. foundry operational is vital to maintaining and protecting domestic production of Navy submarine and surface ship propulsors.  Electron Beam Welding (EBW): Alternative electron beam welding (EBW) processes are required to support critical path production timelines for large volume support structures.  EBW enables significant cost, schedule, and quality benefits over traditional, domestically available arc welding technologies.  Currently large volume EBW is only available at a foreign source.  This effort seeks to establish a U.S. capability via a phased approach, which includes: welding process development, small scale prototype demonstrations, acquisition, installation and commissioning of large scale capable equipment, and full-scale prototype demonstration.  EBW will enable the Navy to reduce the time required to produce large scale parts with significantly better repeatability, quality, and reliability, and at a lower cost.","38.500","Program increase $3.500: Microelectronics  Expand manufacturing capability for Cold Rolled Aluminum $10.000: optimize the manufacturing processes for aluminum armor alloys that are enabled by cold mill upgrades, which include dynamic shape rolling, non-contact shape measurement, automatic gauge, profile and flatness controls.

Several DoD programs have a supply chain vulnerability of either one domestic source or only foreign owned sources for tungsten. Dependence on a sole source results in higher costs to the DoD, inability to meet surge requirements, and creates a potential single point failure that could jeopardize the warfighter's access to an essential piece of material.

"Joint Artificial Intelligence Center","0.000","NA","12.970","JAIC will use rapid prototype sprints to field increasing predictive maintenance capability for the H-60 helicopter fleet across the Joint Force. JAIC will use data aggregation, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive analytics algorithms to detect, correlate, and predict component failure and optimize supply chain solutions. This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive algorithms into the maintenance and supply business processes of H-60 fleet management, utilizing Joint Force readiness and supply data to process at machine speed versus human speed.  JAIC will also use rapid prototype sprints to field capability to the Joint Force that enables better response to natural disasters, particularly those caused by wildfires and flooding, both common worldwide. Computer vision and algorithms will not only reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data, but provide insights and capability that humans alone currently do not have the capacity to manage. JAIC will develop algorithms focused on ISR and geospatial data to develop baseline GEOINT and infrastructure, then analyze changes to that baseline to best provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief. This will aid in the more efficient, effective, and quick recovery of distressed humans, identify damage to infrastructure, and assist relief efforts or evacuation and aid response. Overall, this effort will reduce risk to human life, critical infrastructure, and improve U.S. response in times of regional or global crises. This effort will integrate AI and ML to provide actionable intelligence and enhance military decision-making by providing algorithms for predictive algorithms, computer vision to identify critical information requirements, and user alerts. The JAIC will create a Joint Common Foundation (JCF) platform that will be crucial to the development, testing, and fielding of AI capabilities to the Department. This JCF will contain shared common components providing NMIs/CMIs and the Department with the packages, frameworks, software, tools necessary to accelerate the adoption of AI-enabled capabilities. This includes the build out of AI platforms in a secure protected enclave hosted in a multi-cloud/multi-domain environment which provides NMIs/CMIs with compute, storage and security. The JCF platform supports scalable delivery of novel, impactful AI capability across DoD through the use of several key infrastructure elements. This infrastructure/environment will support each stage of the applied AI lifecycle, including: prototyping, integration, scaling, and support. The common foundation includes shared data, reusable tools, frameworks and standards, in addition to cloud and edge services.  As the JAIC scales and the common foundation develops, entities across DOD will be able to both use and contribute to the infrastructure, leveraging the “factory” of artifacts. This will be done in collaboration with industry and government partners, including technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and across the Department. The JCF platform will promote information sharing and integration with Programs of Record by facilitating rapid deployment of AI capabilities into operational environments, military platforms and IT systems.  JAIC will establish its Tier 2 (Mission/Business Processes) and Tier 3 (IS and PIT Systems)  RMF governance structure to comply with DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT) and DoDI 8500.01,  Cybersecurity.

In 2014, the producer announced it was preparing to close its facility and relocate operations OCONUS.  Investing in casting equipment allows the producer to develop additional skills, which should drive revenue and increase the foundry's utilization rate.  Keeping the U.S. foundry operational is vital to maintaining and protecting domestic production of Navy submarine and surface ship propulsors.  Electron Beam Welding (EBW): Alternative electron beam welding (EBW) processes are required to support critical path production timelines for large volume support structures.  EBW enables significant cost, schedule, and quality benefits over traditional, domestically available arc welding technologies.  Currently large volume EBW is only available at a foreign source.  This effort seeks to establish a U.S. capability via a phased approach, which includes: welding process development, small scale prototype demonstrations, acquisition, installation and commissioning of large scale capable equipment, and full-scale prototype demonstration.  EBW will enable the Navy to reduce the time required to produce large scale parts with significantly better repeatability, quality, and reliability, and at a lower cost.","38.500","Program increase $3.500: Microelectronics  Expand manufacturing capability for Cold Rolled Aluminum $10.000: optimize the manufacturing processes for aluminum armor alloys that are enabled by cold mill upgrades, which include dynamic shape rolling, non-contact shape measurement, automatic gauge, profile and flatness controls.  The enhanced and upgraded cold mill will rapidly prototype aluminum armor manufacturing processes that not only optimize quality and throughput, but examine and mature processes to prototype mill products that enable more cost efficient downstream processing.   Large Scale Classified Electron Beam Welding $15.000: described above under Congressional Add FY 2018 Accomplishments.  Risk reduction for tungsten defense products $10.000: Defense applications for tungsten range widely: from consumables such as ammunition, bombs, and missiles to critical components in radar, communication equipment, tungsten carbide tooling inserts and ferrotungsten used in the production of super alloys in jet turbines. Several DoD programs have a supply chain vulnerability of either one domestic source or only foreign owned sources for tungsten. Dependence on a sole source results in higher costs to the DoD, inability to meet surge requirements, and creates a potential single point failure that could jeopardize the warfighter's access to an essential piece of material. This effort seeks to reduce risk and enhance the U.S. capability to produce tungsten through critical modernization investments in areas that support DoD, improve quality, efficiency and increase overall capacity.","2020-BASE_RDTE-2020-OSD-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Office_of_the_Secretary_Of_Defense_PB_2020.zzz_unzipped-U_RDTE_MasterJustificationBook_Office_of_the_Secretary_Of_Defense_PB_2020.xml","0e014eb633393bdfebb5de3488d7cb9ee925ecdc5617365003b7fa2886e9464d","0-d30fb1805e989372f891a524a29b864f2b5d59e5fea934c9e71404fca243d740","0-671e83f131aeb3800867cedb1c6bdef1380a5cbb47e459c360777fd941d5f8a7","root.record.ProjectList.Project"

AEGIS (Part I) - (PEO IWS) Apply ATRT to at-sea testing analysis to extend coverage of AEGIS 3.2 requirements (combat system level) and update scenario manager to assist with land-based testing for Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 08 and ACB 12 baselines.   Integrated Common Processor (ICP) / Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (A-RCI) - (PEO LMW/SUB) ICP and A-RCI use common software components from submarine and surface USW systems.  PMS 485 and 401 have developed plan for combined project.    LCS Mission Module (MM)-Seaframe (Part I) - (PEO LMW) Apply ATRT to automate message-based interface testing between LCS MM and Seaframe Combat Management System (CMS).  Focus on MM messaging and minimal required CMS messaging.   Development of specifications, standards, and FY12 proposal content. This information will be a product of the future ATRT work group with collaboration from other ATRT users within the community.","3-db6da1967f59ed4e14a47cc06a85847a5980d3d9b17d4950ee781c032e17a13d","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.  A new initiative that began was the Site Assessment program that involved an NMDP staff member reviewing existing documentation at 11 RITN transplant centers against a standardized checklist. As a result, many best practices were gleaned from these centers and the RITN SOP template was updated based on the content of the checklists.  NMRC: During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments.  This includes over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  Numerous science and technology accomplishments are included and these developments are translated into the development of medical countermeasures to respond to potential marrow toxic injury which are linked to the national effort to develop medical countermeasures for radiation injury.      Georgetown: Donor Center Progress The DoD registry includes 707,913 volunteers of which 45,362 volunteers were recruited in 2011. There were 8,709 health evaluations and confirmatory HLA typings requested in 2011 and 892 requests were made for stem cell collection of which 577 went to actual collection.  Probe Testing Progress: The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.  Sequencing Progress Report: Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","1-46e43d65b5fa08d8621a30bd6e01295a7265efb5e7036d01fb9ac8ab3ef69495","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.  A new initiative that began was the Site Assessment program that involved an NMDP staff member reviewing existing documentation at 11 RITN transplant centers against a standardized checklist. As a result, many best practices were gleaned from these centers and the RITN SOP template was updated based on the content of the checklists.  NMRC: During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments.  This includes over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  Numerous science and technology accomplishments are included and these developments are translated into the development of medical countermeasures to respond to potential marrow toxic injury which are linked to the national effort to develop medical countermeasures for radiation injury.      Georgetown: Donor Center Progress The DoD registry includes 707,913 volunteers of which 45,362 volunteers were recruited in 2011. There were 8,709 health evaluations and confirmatory HLA typings requested in 2011 and 892 requests were made for stem cell collection of which 577 went to actual collection.  Probe Testing Progress: The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.  Sequencing Progress Report: Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","1-ac5d259c1af73642fe7109c751a9fcedcc51a57f0c50390ed066fcbffcb0116f","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

In FY13 funds will be awarded to the University of Washington to initiate a six-month detailed engineering design effort by a naval architect, followed by a competitive selection for a shipyard to implement the design plans. The THOMPSON will enter the shipyard in November 2014 to begin the refit.  Deliverables will support new environmental compliance requirements regarding ballast water treatment, marine sanitation, engine exhaust, incinerator exhaust, air conditioning refrigerants, and oily-water separation.  Additional deliverables will overcome obsolescence of diesel engine and electrical system components, and enhance the ship safety with piping replacements in the ship's firemain and ballast water systems.","1-f4cba3e6395f4e63c7dee761b87d48e43ad29135c918d2766286a881dcc637ce","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

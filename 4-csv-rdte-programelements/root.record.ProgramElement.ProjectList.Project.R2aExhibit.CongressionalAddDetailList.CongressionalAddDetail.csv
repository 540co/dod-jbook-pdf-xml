The following areas of investment were selected for funding and enable advanced manufacturing production improvements for transparent armor, stealth technology, targeting systems and other key joint defense technologies:  •Adaptive Machining – to develop part measurement technology for direct measurement on the tool surface and/or during machining  •Automation of Non-destructive Evaluation – to develop automated analysis methods for assessing part quality at reduced labor time and cost •Electro-optical Targeting System Producibility – to develop automated technology for the production of a targeting system, reducing cost and hand labor •Low Observable Producibility – manufacturing scale-up for stealth technology materials •Metals Direct Digital Manufacturing – to advance direct digital manufacturing for metallic structures, reducing lead times for critical parts •Optical Windows – to improve manufacturing capabilities for large aluminum oxynitride (ALON) structures for transparent armor and airborne sensors  •Supply chain Technical Data Package – to increase the ability for smooth operation of the defense industrial base supply chain •Connecting American Manufacturing – to create a national-level, integrated framework to enable rapid, high-density, multi-sector brokering between buyers and US suppliers  Multiple platforms will benefit from these programs including joint light tactical vehicles (JLTV), mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, F-35, and the Zumwalt class destroyer (DDG-1000).  Broad agency announcements and requests for proposals sent to industry for the IBIF topics.

The IBIF programs all addressed key defense-wide manufacturing science and technology issues, with the additional requirements of addressing surge and/or diminishing material source issues.  In addition, these programs all had a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were executed to enable a diverse suite of advanced manufacturing production improvements:  - Connecting American Manufacturing – created a national-level, integrated framework to enable rapid, high-density, multi-sector brokering between buyers and US suppliers - Additive manufacturing initiative – created a large collaboration on additive manufacturing, which enabled innovative research, transition to multiple DoD platforms, and educational opportunities - Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) for Electron Beam additive manufacturing – developed rapid and affordable NDE techniques for Ti and other metal parts manufactured using a directed energy additive technique  - Read-out Integrated Circuit for Electro-optical distributed aperture system (EODAS) – redesigned, fabricated, tested, and laser hardened EODAS ROIC to use state-of-the-art foundry equipment and increase yield.   - Slurry Dip Automation – developed an automated dipping and slurry management system for flare countermeasure products that effectively eliminated human operators from the dangerous process - On-tool Inspection of Fiber Placement – developed non-destructive evaluation and quality inspection techniques within the fiber placement head for in-process, rapid inspection,  improving yield and process control - Curved transparent armor – developed manufacturing technology of transparent armor, which enabled curved and thinner transparent structures and decreasing cost - Transparent Ceramics – Sapphire – created an approach to determine the significant factors affecting the velocity of single crystal growth of large sheet sapphire production.  - Quallion Lithium-ion 6T Vehicle Starter Battery – Developed a lithium-ion military vehicle starter battery that significantly improves power and energy density of the standard 6T lead acid battery.   Implemented semi-automated manufacturing processes to move this key component into high volume production and utilize Quallion Zero-Volt cells to reduce life cycle costs. - Saft Lithium Ion Energy Storage – Developed lithium ion electrochemical solution integrated with appropriate packaging and systems engineering that provides a Starting / Lighting / Ignition battery for military 14 Volt systems.

Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.  A new initiative that began was the Site Assessment program that involved an NMDP staff member reviewing existing documentation at 11 RITN transplant centers against a standardized checklist. As a result, many best practices were gleaned from these centers and the RITN SOP template was updated based on the content of the checklists.  NMRC: During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments.  This includes over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  Numerous science and technology accomplishments are included and these developments are translated into the development of medical countermeasures to respond to potential marrow toxic injury which are linked to the national effort to develop medical countermeasures for radiation injury.      Georgetown: Donor Center Progress The DoD registry includes 707,913 volunteers of which 45,362 volunteers were recruited in 2011. There were 8,709 health evaluations and confirmatory HLA typings requested in 2011 and 892 requests were made for stem cell collection of which 577 went to actual collection.  Probe Testing Progress: The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.  Sequencing Progress Report: Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","1-e8e5637c3f01bfd93172d76ab7f4219177389ee955df9beb2c8c4ca03fe2a5ba","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.  A new initiative that began was the Site Assessment program that involved an NMDP staff member reviewing existing documentation at 11 RITN transplant centers against a standardized checklist. As a result, many best practices were gleaned from these centers and the RITN SOP template was updated based on the content of the checklists.  NMRC: During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments.  This includes over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  Numerous science and technology accomplishments are included and these developments are translated into the development of medical countermeasures to respond to potential marrow toxic injury which are linked to the national effort to develop medical countermeasures for radiation injury.      Georgetown: Donor Center Progress The DoD registry includes 707,913 volunteers of which 45,362 volunteers were recruited in 2011. There were 8,709 health evaluations and confirmatory HLA typings requested in 2011 and 892 requests were made for stem cell collection of which 577 went to actual collection.  Probe Testing Progress: The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.  Sequencing Progress Report: Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","1-c0dbfebf650201153dd0ff1ce12c9a1f4f1a9f14a5fb1db44e58794db88145c7","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.  A new initiative that began was the Site Assessment program that involved an NMDP staff member reviewing existing documentation at 11 RITN transplant centers against a standardized checklist. As a result, many best practices were gleaned from these centers and the RITN SOP template was updated based on the content of the checklists.  NMRC: During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments.  This includes over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  Numerous science and technology accomplishments are included and these developments are translated into the development of medical countermeasures to respond to potential marrow toxic injury which are linked to the national effort to develop medical countermeasures for radiation injury.      Georgetown: Donor Center Progress The DoD registry includes 707,913 volunteers of which 45,362 volunteers were recruited in 2011. There were 8,709 health evaluations and confirmatory HLA typings requested in 2011 and 892 requests were made for stem cell collection of which 577 went to actual collection.  Probe Testing Progress: The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.  Sequencing Progress Report: Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","1-d1d060d8a5f7849b5e0f98b31962f4d35d46c415c25f857fc32cbbbbf72e4b9c","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

In addition, these programs all had a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were executed to enable a diverse suite of advanced manufacturing production improvements  - Innovation Manufacturing Institutes (IMI) (previously Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Institutes) (see program  descriptions addressed above):    1) IMI for 3D printing:  The institute accomplished a first-year, start-up phase consisting of establishing over 80 industry, academic, and non-profit members, creating a balanced governance structure to engage industry and government stakeholders, development of performance metrics, a project call process, an operating plan, the hiring of full-time staff, and completed renovations of the headquarters, the Innovation Factory.  A Call for Projects resulted in six applied research projects, engaging over 35 member organizations on project teams.  The Additive Manufacturing technology roadmap was developed using results generated from a series of workshops with members.  A  Second Project Call was launched with anticipated awards totaling $9 million (government share).  Plans for education and workforce training and outreach were developed, and initiatives were launched in these areas.

In addition, these programs all had a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were executed to enable a diverse suite of advanced manufacturing production improvements  - Innovation Manufacturing Institutes (IMI) (previously Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Institutes) (see program  descriptions addressed above):    1) IMI for 3D printing:  The institute accomplished a first-year, start-up phase consisting of establishing over 80 industry, academic, and non-profit members, creating a balanced governance structure to engage industry and government stakeholders, development of performance metrics, a project call process, an operating plan, the hiring of full-time staff, and completed renovations of the headquarters, the Innovation Factory.  A Call for Projects resulted in six applied research projects, engaging over 35 member organizations on project teams.  The Additive Manufacturing technology roadmap was developed using results generated from a series of workshops with members.  A  Second Project Call was launched with anticipated awards totaling $9 million (government share).  Plans for education and workforce training and outreach were developed, and initiatives were launched in these areas.

Lasers hold the promise of very finely detecting these particle motions, but this detection has to overcome large amounts of ambient particle motions which are not due to acoustic energy at particular frequencies.  Research experimentation is attempting to overcome these extraneous signals.  - Recent at-sea efforts showed that refracted acoustic energy in the upper ocean leads to regions which are quieter than others.  This phenomenon will be examined further with experiments at higher latitudes.  The physical nature of these quiet regions will be investigated to construct a predictive model.  -  Details of the ocean surface wave field hold clues to signatures of shallow submerged objects.  Fluid dynamical studies of wave-wave and wave-turbulent interactions over larger areas, to connect with remote sensing methods, are being incorporated into parallel algorithmic formulations for rapid processing.

During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments including over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.    The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.    Probe Testing Progress: The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.

Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join the RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.  During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments including over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.    The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.    Probe Testing Progress: The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.  Sequencing Progress Report: Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","1-d3a138548c36a540847937c3a6df5bab436967bb75f01cc2f9606dcf7cc51bfc","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join the RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.  During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments including over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.    The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.    Probe Testing Progress: The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.  Sequencing Progress Report: Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","1-ec0a49485998897e418f5b00af5dd581d9ee88a2c72744f14c602ef2a386d2e7","root.record.ProgramElement.ProjectList.Project"

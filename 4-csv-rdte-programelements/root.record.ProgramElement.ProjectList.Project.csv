The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The APSI project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with 10 times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets.

The HDT is required to replace the M917 and F5070 HDT.  In FY14, Army PM MRAP will execute research and development on survivability, mobility and storage technologies. Within the survivability arena, JPO MRAP will focus on improved underbody armor concepts to improve current capabilities and to accomplish this with no to only minimal increase in vehicle weight.  Additional survivability efforts will work toward RPG/Shaped Charge threat defeat mechanisms that have a higher probability of defeating this prolific threat, as well as developments in Transparent Armor (TA) that will extend the life of the TA in order to reduce sustainment costs.  Additional analysis of black box data recorders from vehicles operating in a home station training profile will also give us opportunities to reduce operating and sustainment costs when operating CONUS. Due to the size and increased weight of the enduring MRAP variants, mobility studies will be conducted to identify technologies that will regain levels of mobility that were traded off during previous survivability upgrades. Since a significant portion of the MRAP vehicles will be stored in APS locations, PM MRAP will also conduct corrosion protection efforts to develop strategies to minimize degradation of systems that are held in long term storage.","Funds will provide for test assets, design and integration of Military specific requirements; test and evaluation; and program management in support of FHTV - Heavy Dump Truck (HDT).

The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to forces on a global scale.  The REF provides the Army's rapid response capability to develop, prototype, acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for deployed forces.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities and surrogate material solutions into committed, deploying and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment and spiral development.  It plans and executes assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs, desired future force capabilities and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Senior Army Leaders.   The REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. The REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years. The REF Headquarters Operations team will coordinate in theater work with Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver and sustain solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility, permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.    As the REF procures the COTS and GOTS solutions in the future that are not Type Classified or an Army Program of Record (POR), there will be a substantial logistics/sustainment tail that accompanies these capabilities, particularly as these solutions are being employed in immature or austere theaters where the logistics infrastructure is not already established.  The REF works directly with Operational Commanders at Brigade and below to find solutions to identified equipping requirements. These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a Future Force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.   The REF key tasks are:  - Partner with Army Service Component Commands and be responsive to tactical unit commanders in a global operating environment - Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement/Joint Emergent Operational Needs Statement (ONS/JUONS/JEONS) Gaps to meet urgent needs - Develop material solutions to counter emerging global Asymmetric Threats with reduced Soldiers in the operational environment - Ensure training, transportation, and sustainment are provided with every capability - Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers hands - Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army  - Transition effective projects through Capability Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) to support long-term sustainment - Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope, but operate within the law - Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units   The REF Integrated Priority list (RIPL) consists of the REF top seven priorities based on requirements received from deployed units, and drives all REF efforts.  The priorities with associated metrics as of 31 January 2014:  1.  Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat (24 Requirements/13 Projects) 2.  Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Sustainment (35 Requirements/32 Projects) 3.  Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Force Protection (47 Requirements/32 Projects) 4.  Dismounted Operations Support (60 Requirements/43 Projects) 5.  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operational Environments (OEs) (49 Requirements/30 Projects) 6.  Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command (12 Requirements/7 Projects) 7.  Other (43 Requirements/24 Projects)  Total:  270 Requirements/181 Projects  FY12 metric shows the REF average procurement unit cost of ~$1.1 million per requirement.   REF supports COCOM/ASCC based emerging rapid equipment requirements.  Army Senior Leadership has determined the REF will be an enduring organization (Base funded) per Headquarters, Department of the Army, Deptuy Chief of Staff memo, SUBJECT: Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF), signed by:  Joseph W. Westphal, dated 30 January 2014.    The REF FY15 RDT&E Request of $6.120 million (Base) and $4.500 million (OCO) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection; Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Defeat; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and Tactical Command; Control and Communication tools.   RDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions. RDT&E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed US Army Forces problems with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Soldier in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier- any modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) item has to be tested.","The United States Army Rapid Equipping Force harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of US Army Forces employed globally. The REF focus is on rapidly placing game-changing capabilities into Soldiers' hands. This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: rapidly adapting Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) equipment to meet operational needs and developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia. All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment is provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved program of record or terminated through the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army equipping and fielding decisions.  REF capabilities routinely serve to bridge specific Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) and Joint Emergent Operational Needs Statement (JEONS) gaps to meet urgent requirements.","N/A","","","2015-AMENDED_PROCUREMENT_AND_RDTE-2015-ARMY-RDTE_JustificationBook_Army_PBAmended_2015.zzz_unzipped-RDTE_JustificationBook_Army_PBAmended_2015.xml","32a22a37030a60af9bbb6e3b78abf3f1d8c8ff7928cc71e92cf6e4650a2e1ddd","1-8ed69b356b2f37602d2ad74dd6cbdb095d73f4a8a2da779c1c431a5b3f48b37a","","108-be4f233326c69c2eccb86392013b48ef3e359dfb6a03bee01b0bf3fd4d0a9f79","root"

The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon- fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7. Efforts include:  scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers; active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition); robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions; and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight.","","N/A","Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.","","","","2017-BASE_RDTE-2017-AIRFORCE_V1-U_RDTE_JustificationBook_Air_Force_PB_2017.zzz_unzipped-U_RDTE_JustificationBook_Air_Force_PB_2017.xml","d49532f0c2392cb72e8a34cbfbec5e9ccfcec68bbc6d457e68b77d246acd62ea","4-d02c6314d67af968f1610a46b7c2e97206a202782f2ff00cd9e598115ff69b13","","","","144-f3fafe756365e9616841c13139cf34ff301e477fdf0ab940c115afa68c3be328","root"

The objective is to provide continuous evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components such as; inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, exhaust systems, and system level technologies such as; integrated power generators and thermal management systems on core engine performance, and durability in ground demonstrations of engine cores. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) Project of this program. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.","","N/A","Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.","","","","2017-BASE_RDTE-2017-AIRFORCE_V1-U_RDTE_JustificationBook_Air_Force_PB_2017.zzz_unzipped-U_RDTE_JustificationBook_Air_Force_PB_2017.xml","d49532f0c2392cb72e8a34cbfbec5e9ccfcec68bbc6d457e68b77d246acd62ea","5-1af75f4ddb660113c84e60306e92395bb7ddd21f6444e137ec39b5cd570bfe8e","","","","144-f3fafe756365e9616841c13139cf34ff301e477fdf0ab940c115afa68c3be328","root"

On January 29, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission completed an auction of Advanced Wireless Service licenses in the 1695-1710 Megahertz (MHz), 1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz bands (collectively, the AWS-3” bands). On June 23, 2015, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) notified Congress of the forthcoming transfer of $5.030 billion to federal agencies with systems affected by the AWS-3 transition. Following the conclusion of the 30-day statutory waiting period, OMB transferred the funds to the federal agencies.   The Department of Defense (DoD) received $3.500 billion of the auction proceeds and created a $500 million Spectrum Access Research and Development Program (SAR&DP) to investigate new DoD technologies. The SAR&DP encompasses spectrum technology development that enables the DoD to perform its missions using spectrum-dependent systems in a manner that preferably enhances operational readiness and capability. Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for pursued technology solutions. DoD's transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are sufficiently resilient (survivable and electronically protected) to operate in both the United States and congested/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed.  This program represents the Air Force investment within the SAR&DP.

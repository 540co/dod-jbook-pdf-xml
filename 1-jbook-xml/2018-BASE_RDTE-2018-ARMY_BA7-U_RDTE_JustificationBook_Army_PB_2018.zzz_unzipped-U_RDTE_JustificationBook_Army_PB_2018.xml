            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funding for DZ8 has been realigned to PE 0607134, Proj ES1, beginning FY17.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project DX8.  The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.

Justification:

FY2018 Base funding in the amount of $3.929 million for project DX8 supports HIMARS-unique Software Build, Version 8.2.  This software is projected to be available for fielding to the M142 fleet in FY2019.  Software Version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade.

Project 093.  The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers. This project funds software development for the MLRS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.

Justification:

FY2018 Base funding in the amount of $5.000 million for project 093 supports the initiation of software development of an organic tactical software build in support of the interim Fire Control System (FCS) hardware supporting both the current MLRS Fleet (upon upgrade with a modern hardware FCS) and the Army’s MLRS Fleet Expansion effort.  This software development leverages the program’s completed software transition from the prime contractor to the government in FY2016.  This interim FCS solution will be ready to field in FY2021 and the long-term FCS solution is expected to be ready to field in FY2024.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and anticipated to be the first release of organic software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher in FY2021.

Project DZ8:  Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack/neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 300km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was directed in the Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013. The AoA was completed on 30 April 2015 and a letter of sufficiency issued by OSD in September 2015. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) is scheduled for 06 January 2017.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MLRS Product Improvement Program performs development efforts required to address emerging requirements. 

The Army transitioning complete software acquisition from the prime contractor (legacy v7.x) to an organic (government developed, maintained, and owned) approach (v8.x forward) by utilizing the Aviation &amp; Missile Research &amp; Development Engineering Center's (AMRDEC) Software Engineering Directorate (SED) as the software developer. This funding supports the MLRS share of the software development and is funded via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).

Emerging requirements include updates to address emerging threats of the launcher organic version 8.x software, reacting to system changes driven by policy and emerging requirements, and maintaining architectural compatibility.  Communication suite changes, munitions updates, and introduction of new munitions require software and/or hardware updates to ensure full compatibility and maintain operational viability.

The enduring organic v8.2 software effort is projected for Materiel Release and fielding to the M270A2 (MLRS) launcher when upgraded with the interim Fire Control System solution. An incremental software release plan will be developed to address emerging SW requirements beyond v8.2 in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project DX8.  The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.

FY2018 Base funding in the amount of $3.929 million for project DX8 supports HIMARS-unique Software Build, Version 8.2.  This software is projected to be available for fielding to the M142 fleet in FY2019.  In addition to addressing software maintenance, Software Version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack/neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017.

The Army initially funded the development of the LRPF under PE 0603778A, Proj DZ8. Two DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) agreements were awarded to support efforts under the Material Solution Analysis Phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

An AoA supporting the MS A decision has been completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with the OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015.  Two DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) agreements were awarded to support efforts under the Material Solution Analysis (MSA)Phase. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) held a MS A decision review in 2QFY17. TMRR will include two DOTC award agreements for competitive prototyping leading to flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY19. Data from the TMRR phase to include results from the flight demonstrations will support the FY21 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award. EMD will be awarded to a single industry team that has the best overall LRPF design. The EMD phase will complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and limited user test.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project ER2: The Close Combat Technology program includes development efforts to upgrade Close Combat technologies, energetics, and munitions, such as counter explosives, grenades, demolitions, shoulder launched munitions, pyrotechnic simulators, countermeasure flares, non-lethal ammunition/systems, networked munitions and mines, that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.  This program will identify, characterize, study, analyze, test and develop technologies to resolve close combat munition reliability, safety, environmental, storage, standardization, obsolescence and manufacturing/producibility issues.

FY 2018 funds will be used to support the following efforts: MK3A2 Offensive Hand Grenade, Countermeasure Flare Decoy Formulations, and AN-M82A Obscuration Grenade.

Project ER5: The Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology project includes product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production.  Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Projects include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.   

FY 2018 funding supports testing to demonstrate fuze setback spring interface improvements, engineering tests to prove-out the mortar fuze electronics upgrades, studies on medium caliber fuzes to improve throughput and reduce costs, testing to prove-out impact switch upgrades, evaluations on transceiver component replacement prototype devices for indirect fire and direct fire fuzes, studies on second source MEMS-based G-switches for medium and large caliber applications, and 81mm M821A3E1 HE IM Mortar completion of safety/environmental test and analysis and full arena testing and analysis of test data.

Project ER6: The Munitions, Survivability and Logistics program funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements.

FY 2018 funds are used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested. Warhead improvement and primer improvement for the 30mm Apache ammunition are also under development. A number of studies on potential improvements for training ammunition and environmentally friendly primers will be conducted. Potential improvements to 105mm and 120mm ammunition will be examined.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology project includes product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production.  Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Projects include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.   

This supports the identification, study, analysis, and development of fuzing technologies and safe arm devices in production and in the field.  This project will implement technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  The project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades.  Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available.  It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects.  The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes, increase commonality of fuze components and requirements.  Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.

This supports the implementation of IM improvements to the 81mm Mortar Cartridge while meeting all other Key Performance Parameters, namely lethality.  The M821A3 IM cartridge does not meet lethality requirements as outlined in the User Requirements (Capability Production Document (CPD)).  This project is to design an 81mm Mortar (M821A3E1) with pre-formed fragmentation to increase the lethality.  The M821 series of 81mm Mortars is the primary 81mm go-to-war round for U.S. Army and USMC.  This project will provide users a safer round, improving the IM technology and reducing the risk of unplanned stimuli.  This project will also provide enhanced lethality over the M821A3, increasing the capability of the 81mm system.  RDT&amp;E funding is required to develop, test and qualify the pre-formed fragmentation design on the 81mm IM round and ensure that lethality performance requirements are met.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Fuze Technology Improvement (FTI) will improve current production munitions by exploiting existing fuzing technologies and inserting them into current fielded and/or production fuzes, providing safer, more producible, and more lethal fuzing solutions.  FTI develops second source suppliers and resolves component obsolescence issues to mitigate risk and prevent production interruptions in order to continue to provide safer, more reliable munitions for the Warfighter with significant risk reduction to production fuzes also benefiting the U.S. Taxpayer.  The effort is a continuation of studies, analysis, evaluations, and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field.  This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude component obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.

The 81mm M821A3E1 HE IM Mortar Project utilizes the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) to conduct loading studies and produce test samples.  The initiatives emphasize improving the manufacturability of the M821A3E1 to minimize unit cost burden in the future.  Follow-on production of the M821A3E1 will utilize the component break-out strategy where the Office of the Project Manager (PM) Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) will be the Systems Integrator in order to maximize efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities.  The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack/neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield.  The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017.

FY 2018 Base funding in the amount of $102.014 million continues risk reduction activities through the execution of Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) system demonstration agreements.  LRPF will be developed using competitive prototyping, carrying two contractors through the TMRR Phase. The FY18 funding will be used to continue execution of two TMRR prototyping and flight demonstration agreements, which include a System Requirements Review (SRR), functional reviews, prototype design activities, assessment of future growth capabilities, and initiates the building of eight (8) prototype missiles required to support flight demonstrations.  Funding also supports Government management and Government systems engineering and test support activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>LRPF is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon ATACMS capabilities to provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather, area target, long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk. An AoA supporting the MS A decision has been completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with the OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015. Two DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) agreements were awarded to support efforts under the Material Solution Analysis (MSA) Phase. TMRR will include two DOTC award agreements for competitive prototyping leading to flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY19. Data from the TMRR phase to include results from the flight demonstrations will support the FY21 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award. EMD will be a competitive award to a single contractor. The EMD phase will complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and limited user test.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 budget request for Apache AH-64E, previously known as Apache Block III, will fund the non-recurring engineering (NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build of 690 Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began in Oct 2011).  The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) integration.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NRE will encompass subsystem integration and will utilize existing test aircraft, incorporate the technical insertions, and initiate appropriate qualification and operational flight-testing. 

In FY14, a contract for Apache AH-64E Lot 3, initiating Full Rate Production, was awarded with options for Lot 4 and will continue to a total of 690 remanufactured and new build aircraft.

Training device concurrency will be maintained with each technical insertion. The Engineering/Manufacturing Design (EMD) effort is managed as Cost Reimbursable.  Production efforts will be awarded as Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) and include the Advance Procurement requirements.

In FY13, FY14, and FY15 MRL NRE encompassed US Government (USG) design of the Hydra Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA), modification of the M261 launcher, launcher fabrication, and launcher testing.

In FY15-FY18, Apache AH-64E Version 6 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Contract. 

Multi-year production authority has been approved.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funds in this program were realigned in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 from Program Element 0203744A Aircraft Modifications/Product Improvement Programs, Project 504, for more efficient program management.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The H-60L Digital Blackhawk, now designated as UH-60V, is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging.

FY 2017 UH-60V funds hardware and software development as well as training material development and developmental testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The H-60L Digital Blackhawk, now designated as UH-60V, is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging.

FY 2017 UH-60V funds hardware and software development as well as training material development and developmental testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The CH-47 Chinook is the Army's only heavy lift helicopter and is an essential element of the Army Aviation portfolio strategy. This program funds improvements to the CH-47F System that include the transition from individual Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) into a CH-47F Block II program of record with entry into Engineering/Manufacturing Design (EMD) phase with Milestone B approval expected in 3rd quarter 2017.  Additionally, funding supports:  continued development and testing of the Advanced Chinook Rotor Blades (ACRB) which will provide increased lift in high/hot conditions and reduce Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs, T55-GA-714A engine control and component upgrades, and advanced flight control and drive train component improvements to improve aircraft performance. Development of requirements specifications, studies and risk reduction prototyping are also part of this effort.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The CH-47F program replaces the aging CH-47D aircraft by FY 2020, incorporates a new machined airframe, and includes a new Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) cockpit with digital communication/navigation capability allowing improved interoperability on the digital battlefield. The CH-47F program includes recapitalization of key dynamic components, bringing them to a near zero time.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Given the need to maintain the fleet’s relevance through 2060, the PM is proposing a block strategy to facilitate incremental upgrades to the Chinook fleet. Using the CH-47F as a baseline, the H-47 Block II is the first increment of this potential multi-block strategy. The Block II program will restore performance lost due to the added weight of safety and survivability equipment incorporated since initial fielding in 2007. Additional objectives of the Block II program include: Efficiently incorporating multiple engineering changes; Accomplishing required mid-life airframe recapitalization; Converging the special operations and conventional Army designs; Establishing a foundation for future block upgrades; and Maintaining the industrial base until Future Vertical Lift (FVL)-Heavy is realized.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The budget line provides for Fixed Wing (FW) fielded fleet Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC) and associated developmental testing, and integration of all Army fixed wing aircraft to provide Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS), Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), and Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving international and Army standards.  As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusions are likely for aircraft not properly equipped. Upgrade of communication and aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy. This budget line will also provide funding for studies, evaluations and Analysis of Alternatives to support emerging Army fixed wing requirements for product improvements to support the FW fleet.

In accordance with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) Working Oversight List (dated 26 Jun 15), the Fixed Wing Utility Aircraft (FUA) Program will be required to undergo both Live Fire Testing and Operational Testing. This budget line provides funding for development of the FUA Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), the execution of FUA Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) including necessary hardware, and FUA Operational Testing including execution of Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>For Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 and prior, all funding for the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) was contained in Program Element (PE) 0203744A – Aircraft Modifications/Product Improvement Programs, Project 504.  FY 2015 funding was initially moved to PE 0203744A, Project EB1.  Prior to execution, FY 2015 and beyond funding was moved to to PE 0607139A, Project ES6. This is not a New Start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>ITEP develops, tests, qualifies, and integrates the next generation turboshaft engine on the Black Hawk and Apache aircraft.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6,000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 class shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.

FY 2016 funding provided for dual vendor competitive Technology Maturation/Risk Reduction (TMRR) contract awards, initial engine design effort, and continued platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2017 funding continues engine design effort and the platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2018 funds the remaining TMRR engine design effort, the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) SSEB for entry into Milestone B (MS B), and concludes the platform/engine integration trade studies.  In FY 2019, the EMD contract will be awarded to one vendor, and platform/engine integration design engineering will begin.   FY 2020 funding continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration A-kit development, resulting in a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY 2020. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, provides for First Engine To Test (FETT), and begins physical airframe integration.  FY 2022 funding will provide Preliminary Flight Rating (PFR) testing, leading to an Air Worthiness Rating (AWR).

If funding permits,ITEP will continue to pursue potential program acceleration directed by the May 2016 AROC.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) has been designated by the Secretary of the Army as the primary system for the accessing, acquiring, and delivery of materiel data. This includes data from all sources designated as Authoritative, as well as, system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. It enables Command visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LOGSA and its LIW suite of products and services provide the Army community with vital logistics data necessary for the planning, conducting and sustainment of war fighting capability worldwide. The LMI-DST directly supports Tiered Readiness by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. Specifically, LMI-DST synchronizes an Army authoritative Demand Signal for manning, equipping, services &amp; infrastructure and authoritative resourcing (money) information, resulting in an accurate prediction of a ready and properly equipped force. The Army Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss Tracker (AFT) tool is a web-based, automated FLIPL processing and tracking system which provides an electronic FLIPL documentation packet that includes intelligent, digital versions of required forms and allows for attachment of supporting documentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) is designated as the Army's authoritative materiel data repository. As chartered by the Secretary of The Army, LIW will provide enterprise-accepted and trusted information for analysis, aggregation, and reuse in support of the Lead Materiel Integrator (LMI) mission. As an Army enterprise-level repository and retrieval system to facilitate accurate choices and rapid decision making. Specifically, LIW will provide all required data structured in a way that allows for querying and reporting; e.g., equipment authorizations, equipment on-hand, new procurement schedules, RESET production schedules and in transit visibility from origin and distribution to final destination, in support of the information needs of the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and other command logistics managers. This includes data from all sources designated as authoritative, as well as system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. LIW enables visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LIW supports the tenants of Mission Command by logistically empowering the Commander to successfully integrate and synchronize logistics information with warfighter functions in time and space to maximize potential for mission success. ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES: LIW provides the data and custom business intelligence environment to enable Command-specific analysis and presentation of business intelligence displays to satisfy unique command management requirements.  LIW serves as the single logistics repository which bridges the Army ERP systems (GCSS-Army, LMP, AESIP, GFEBS) with enduring legacy systems. 

LOGSA is requesting RDTE funds to develop and enhance the Materiel Common Operating Picture (M-COP).  The M-COP provides interactive views, models, and simulations that directly address Warfighter priorities by giving senior Army leaders the ability to visualize current and future materiel requirements, materiel readiness levels and Warfighter materiel readiness options of the Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) at the installation level.  Data from many agencies is integrated into M-COP views, assisting with information superiority for joint and inter-agency operations (examples:  assisting CENTCOM, NORTHCOM, and FEMA).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool (LMI DST) is a software solution, resident within the Logistics Information Warehouse, that supports the Army Materiel Command in its mission as the Army Lead Materiel Integrator as well as materiel managers at Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, Direct Reporting Units, Corps and Divisions with making informed equipping decisions. The LMI DST directly supports Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN) by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. 

Specifically, development will enable the tool to consume and display additional data sources, such as maintenance data from both legacy and Enterprise data sources - a critical capability during the fielding of GCSS-Army; provide additional modules, including Second Destination Transportation Planning, supporting USARC and NGB requirements to deprecate legacy systems and a Readiness Cost Banding module to implement analysis algorithms to deliver decisions to optimize readiness within Army cost constraints. New development will also enable equippers to redistribute items, based on their level of modernization, limiting transportation costs of moving outdated equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LMI DST is a development effort to meet the Secretary of the Army's intent in designating the Army Materiel Command as the Lead Materiel Integrator and the Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) as the authoritative repository of Army logistics domain data. The LMI DST integrates logistics domain data from the LIW with materiel demand requirements from the Readiness Enterprise to enable automated decision support for equippers throughout the Army. In August 2011, a sole source contract was awarded to ProModel Corporation to leverage their COTS modeling and simulation capability, the ProModel Application Framework to develop the Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool, which is a GOTS product. The project utilizes an agile development methodology. Versions 1-4 were released on a six-month cadence between December 2011 and April 2013. LMI DST development and sustainment have been transitioned to LOGSA's Information and Technology Services Contract.  Requirements for additional development were collected from Army Commands and vetted through a General Officer Steering Committee, chaired by Army Materiel Command.  RDTE funding supports future major version releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Note:
The Universal product program was previously funded under 0203744A Gray Eagle Modifications and 0305233A Shadow Modifications.

The Universal Products consist of the Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS), the Universal Ground Data Terminal (UGDT) and the Universal Mission Simulator (UMS).  The Universal Products will be capable of flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems.  Protected in a climate-controlled, standard S-280 or S-788 U.S. Army shelter and mounted on either a standard Army FMTV or HMMWV, the UGCS receives and disseminates battlefield video and situational awareness data through state-of-the-art operator consoles.  Consoles can be used to provide aircraft command and control, payload control and weapons launch.  

The UGDT provides a Line of Sight (LOS) capability for transmit and receipt of UAS command and control, and UAS payload product.  The UGDT is the common datalink system for U. S. Army UAS.

The Universal Mission Simulator (UMS) consists of the hardware and software required to fully train UAS operators to full Readiness Level (RL) 1.  The UMS will be capable of training and simulating flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems and features Directorate of Simulation (DOS) accredited Shadow software and Gray Eagle software.

Justification: FY2018 Universal Product Base funding of $38.867 will be used for starting the development of modifications needed to address UGCS obsolescence, maintain interoperability, increase commonality (including a controller to support weapons), and continue development of training devices in support of Trainer System Engineering, Software/System Sustainment, Currency, and Field Support.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) product office has full life-cycle management responsibility of the DoD authoritative biometrics enterprise repository system, known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS).  BEC Increment 0 is comprised of the current version (v1.2) of DoD ABIS and the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) which is DoD ABIS v1.3. DoD ABIS supports identity superiority capabilities for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.  DoD ABIS provides matching, sharing, and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-modal biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm, and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making retain, capture, or release decisions.  Biometric Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) is the Army Program of Record for the current Army collection capability.  DoD ABIS has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).

The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) is the Executive Manager for Army Biometrics and the DoD proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services.  DFBA leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers. These directives are carried out by the DFBA Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). OCS coordinates all science and technology (S&amp;T) efforts and oversees the RDT&amp;E program.

Justification:
FY18 RDT&amp;E funding in the amount of $5.5 million (DT2: Non-MIP Biometrics) enables the BEC product office to continue the DoD ABIS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  Funding supports a required update to the Search core, transaction manager and the authoritative repository, as well as improved / enhanced interoperability with FBI, Department of Homeland Security and other government entities.  Updates to the current Electronic Biometric Transmission Standard (EBTS) which is required in order to enable International Caveat, also improves sharing of data throughout the biometric community.  This funding also supports testing of the DoD ABIS SLEP.

FY 2018 funding in the amount of $0.659 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric T&amp;E activities, including standards conformance and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) interoperability assessments, supporting DoD acquisition organizations, and providing subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army Acquisition Strategy for this program is to; a) award a Bridge Contract in FY17 to the current Systems Integration contractor to continue the operations and sustainment of the current capability (DoD ABIS v1.2); b) conduct a full and open competition in FY17 to competitively select the contractor to perform the Service Life Extension (DoD ABIS v1.3) Development and Deployment.  This upgrade is extremely critical in order to replace end of life hardware and software components, including Commercial Off the Shelf products whose versions currently included in DoD ABIS v1.2 are no longer supported.  The SLEP (v1.3) will extend the service life of the current capability through FY22 and transition to sustainment and will improve interoperability with other government entities such as the FBI, DHS, and Department of Justice.  The Army is currently developing and staffing the requirements documentation and strategy for the next / future Biometrics Enabling Capability that will continue to improve upon the DoD Automated Biometric Identification System.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software Improvements for threat evolution:  Performs necessary analysis and development efforts to maintain PATRIOT system effectiveness against evolving threat technologies and specific threat capabilities.  This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  

Upper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM):  Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment.  Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous engagements and missile wastage on debris.

RDP Waveform Suite:  Develops a comprehensive set of waveforms in the RDP to improve PATRIOT radar capabilities against current and evolving threats, including support to Task 6 and 7 efforts (see below), and implements advanced data collection enabled by the RDP to support further system improvements.  The RDP implementation allows significant radar waveform improvements necessary to counter evolving threats.
 
THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability:  Implements improvements to THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network deficiencies that impact Tactical Ballistic Missile battle management and force/engagement operations.  Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint interoperability. 
 
Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   

Task 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2/Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3, and Missile Segment Enhancement) to counter emerging Tactical Ballistic Missile threats.
 
Task 6:  Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude Tactical Ballistic Missile Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor.  Longer-range detection, track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the Radar Digital Processor, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement  missiles.

Task 7:  Software improvements analyze existing and evolving Tactical Ballistic Missile countermeasures and their effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness.  Develops concepts to address countermeasure effects and ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness.  Develops detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design/code/test software implementation leveraging Radar Digital Processor, Modernized Adjunct Processor, Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator and Flight Solution Computer-Redesign processing capabilities.

Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT):  Efforts will develop and test the military’s improved Global Position M-Code with Patriot Major End Items (MEI) integrating the improved anti-jamming and secure access of military GPS signals.  This effort meets the requirement for Assured PNT through M-Code as mandated by FY2011 National Defense Act, public law 111-383 &amp; 913.

Combat ID Enhancements:  Develop and implement improvements to the Radar Digital Processor-Capability Combat ID capabilities and additional Non-Cooperative Target Recognition techniques to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.

Flat Panel Array Concept Development:  This task provides studies for initial concepts and performance capabilities related to the implementation of an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) transmitter/antenna into the PATRIOT radar.  These assessments are needed to refine user community expectations and requirements, and to prepare a viable set of requirements to support a competitive modernization competition.

Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense:  Provides improved capability for PATRIOT to protect other Army and Joint Services Sensors from ARM attacks.  Builds on an initial capability provided in Post-Deployment Build-7 by determining remaining gaps, identifying and evaluating alternatives, and implementing further improvements.

Tactical Telemetry Ground Station:  Develops a ground-based telemetry receive station to be deployed with the tactical units and collect PAC-3 telemetry data for tactical engagements.   This data will be used to assess missile and system effectiveness in tactical environments against real-world threats, and will support the development of operational improvements (Firing Doctrine and other system settings) and system software improvements to mitigate stressing threat behaviors.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system was to provide a baseline system capable of modification to cope with continuing threat evolution.  This program minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program upgrades the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability and communications, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat.  Upgrades are implemented through individual hardware and software materiel changes and fielded incrementally. This program encompasses several changes which will require the use of a variety of acquisition methods to develop, test, procure and field.  Future software capabilities will be incorporated into future Post Deployment Build (PDB) releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program for Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense,
providing elevated, persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks, enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces
as well as critical geo political assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving
Targets. A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74-
meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are
designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise
Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile
systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface
based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and
contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS prepared and  participated in Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) with NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region (NCR) Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Operational
Exercise (OPEX) from FY14-FY16 as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.  The OPEX included an operational assessment to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment", in accordance
with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13. The Combatant Command (CCMD) objective for the OPEX was to provide the full range of
JLENS Orbit level capability to include: Persistent Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) through Battle Command System Fixed (BCS-F) Integration Combat Identification
(CID) / Electronic Identification (EID) Precision Cue to Fighters/Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) via Tactical Data Link (TDL) Integrated Fire Control to Fighters (IFC)/
GBAD via TDL.

JLENS ended OPEX participation in October 2015 with the direction to store the system in place.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JLENS participation in the OPEX was to allow for a combatant commander’s operational assessment of JLENS capabilities to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment". 

Operational Control of JLENS for the OPEX was transferred to the NORAD/NORTHCOM Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC) on 15 October 2015.  Due to a tether break accident on 28 October 2015 and resulting loss of the Fire Control System aerostat and significant damage to the Radar and Mobile Mooring Station, the Commander NORAD/NORTHCOM suspended JLENS participation in the OPEX pending results of accident investigations and Failure Review Board recommendations.  JLENS participation in the OPEX was terminated per an Under Secretary for Defense Policy decision memorandum dated 15 June 2016.  In accordance with Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) direction, JLENS equipment supporting the OPEX was packed and stored at the APG sites effective 21 June 2016, pending higher headquarters decision on the future of the JLENS program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JLENS prepared for and participated in Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) with NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region (NCR) Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Operational Exercise (OPEX) from FY14-FY16, as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013. JLENS participation in the OPEX was to allow for a combatant commander’s operational assessment of JLENS capabilities to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment". 

Operational Control of JLENS for the OPEX was transferred to the NORAD/NORTHCOM Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC) on 15 October 2015.  Due to a tether break accident on 28 October 2015 resulting in the loss of the Fire Control System aerostat, significant damage to the Radar and Mobile Mooring Station, the Commander NORAD/NORTHCOM suspended JLENS participation in the OPEX pending results from accident investigations and Failure Review Board recommendations.  JLENS participation in the OPEX was terminated per an Under Secretary for Defense Policy decision memorandum dated 15 June 2016.  In accordance with Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) direction, JLENS equipment supporting the OPEX was packed and stored at the APG sites effective 21 June 2016, pending higher headquarters decision on the future of the JLENS program. Courses of action under consideration are staging JLENS equipment in indefinite storage to meet potential future contingency requirements; and termination of the JLENS program with disposition/demilitarization of JLENS equipment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides development for fire support command and control systems used by all Services from platoon to echelons above Corps.  There are two developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently FY18 and beyond:  Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment II) (project code EF7) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment I) (project code EF8).  The development on the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6) will be completed in FY17.

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. 

Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD. 

AFATDS 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS program currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army’s Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 18 May 2015, the Milestone Decision Authority (PEO C3T) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving the PFED Increment II Milestone B. The Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) officially approved entry into the Development phase as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.

PFED Increment II leverages an Army Science and Technology investment by transitioning a software application that has been developed and used in proponent experimentation events (e.g. Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE) and Bold Quest). Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY2015, this software application transitioned to PM Mission Command to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PFED Increment II will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PFED Increment II software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.

PM Mission Command will continue to manage future capability blocks of software development. PM Mission Command will continue to coordinate with PM Soldier Warrior to field and train future versions of the software, as described above.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 13 May 2015, the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that a modernization of the existing AFATDS software code is required to comply with Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to be executed as AFATDS 7.0. In V7.0, the PM will re-design AFATDS to provide the operator role/duty-based interaction, a dynamic embedded training capability, integration of COE compliant architectures and allowance for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.

Development of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

PE Number 0203735A/Project FD8 funds the development of LAV25 enhancements.  The Recovery Vehicle Improvement program (280) is a new start effort.  The M113 Improvements program (431) is a new start effort.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.

The strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  

The Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.

Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and ECP 2 efforts. ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration a suite of complementary lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).

Light Armored Vehicle improvement program will design, test and modify two Light Armored Vehicles (LAV-25A2s) for Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) to inform operational concepts for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in support of Global Response Force early entry operations.  This will directly support the expeditionary maneuver excursion that will be conducted by the XVIII Airborne Corps in FY17-18.

M113 improvements will develop an affordable solution for upgrading the M113s to enhance protection, survivability, mobility and power generation to support the current and future network systems.  This will provide the necessary enhancements to the M113 capability for Echelons Above Brigade (EAB) units with priority to the forward deployed units and equipment sets.  The Armored Multi Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program will replace all M113 family of vehicles in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT).

The Recovery Vehicle Improvement program is a group of ECPs that will allow the current recovery vehicle to regain Single Vehicle Recovery for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle. The current M88A2 is not capable of single vehicle recovery of the M1A2 SEPv2 in all situations and the M1A2 SEPv3 fielding in FY20 will further exacerbate the recovery problem.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift and Evacuation System (HERCULES), a designated ACAT IC program since 15 Jun 2016, has been providing towing, winching, and hoisting operations to support battlefield recovery operations and evacuation of heavy tanks and other tracked combat vehicles since its production and deployment in 1998.  The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes M1 Abrams turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles.  The HERCULES provides Single Vehicle Recovery of the 70 Ton Abrams tank.

The 1998 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) required Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) of a 70T Main Battle Tank.  The Abrams SEPv2 CURRENTLY exceeds the 70T ORD requirement and the M88A2 is unable to safely perform SVR of MBT in all conditions.  SEPv3 further exacerbates the problem.  Current doctrine requires a holdback vehicle for loads > 70T and the M88A2 multi-vehicle towing is not resourced or trained.  The approved CPD as of 10 Jan 2017, requires the Improved M88A2 (M88A2E1) to enable “Single Vehicle Recovery of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.”

Technical assessments and analyses will be used to clarify the capability gap (Single Vehicle Recovery), evaluate design solution concepts, and inform key program decision points.  The goal of the assessments will be to provide confidence to Army Leadership that a M88A2E1 solution is affordable, achievable, and technologically feasible with manageable risk. Limited analyses, conducted to date, suggests that upgrades to the M88A2 track, suspension, transmission, hydraulics and potentially powertrain are required. 

FY 2018 Base dollars in the amount of $5 million will be used to support M88A2 baseline testing and conduct sub-system trade analyses.  FY 2018 Base dollars will also be used for Program Management Support and Contractor and Government Systems Engineering for labor and travel to effectively manage the program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army has approved Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) for the Abrams Main Battle Tank to restore lost capability, host inbound technologies, and to meet objective performance requirements called out in approved platform requirements documents. The strategy for Abrams will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future. This approach was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY2011.

The Abrams vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. In order to restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams. The ECPs will incorporate lost power generation and distribution technologies, force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection Systems, technologies to mitigate obsolescence issues, in-bound technologies under development, and technologies to decrease the overall weight of the tank.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWAP-C) limitations. To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army existing programs of record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army program of records, including continued SINCGARS integration and Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command – Platform (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP 2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY 2017.   The Bradley M2A4 Vehicle is the combination of the M2A3 Base Vehicle with ECP 1 and ECP 2 components installed and integrated.   Additionally, a follow on Engineering Change Proposal to ECP 2, ECP 2b integrates Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) to replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability along with other technology upgrades and insertions (i.e. laser pointing, color camera, laser range finder, Vehicular Integration for Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and, Reconnaissance/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY) architecture compliance, etc). Product Manager Bradley will execute a Non Development Initiative (NDI) to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System. A separate integration effort begins in FY 2018 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Product Manager Bradley will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) reestablishing Space, Weight, Power and Cooling (SWAP-C) to facilitate integration of technologies being developed under existing Programs of Record (POR). The proposed ECPs will restore lost capability, without exceeding operational envelopes outlined in current approved requirement documents. ECP 1 production contract was awarded in FY 2014, and began fielding in FY 2015.  ECP 2 is scheduled to begin fielding in FY 2019 to address powerpack and electrical power upgrades, which will enable the vehicle to host Army directed inbound technologies with no further performance degradation to the vehicle. ECP 2 development has been executed on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract to the current platform Original Equipment Manufacturer. Initiate studies and analysis in order to integrate Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) sights began in FY 2016. The 3GEN FLIR (ECP 2b) system will be developed by Project Manager, Terrestrial Sensors (PM TS) and be provided to Product Manager Bradley as a Horizontal Technology Insertion effort.  Product Manager Bradley will execute a Non Development Initiative (NDI) in order to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System in FY 2018.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and ECP 2 efforts. ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>AAE approval for a 3rd DVH SBCT Brigade of 337 Exchange Vehicles was given on July 26, 2013 (funded in G85100). A successful production decision for ECP 1 was executed on July 22, 2016, which provided approval to begin 4th Brigade Double-V Hull (DVH) Engineering Change Proposal 1 production (funded in Stryker Upgrade - G85200).  Stryker MOD (GM0100) is for Stryker Fleet modifications to include Operational Needs Statement Lethality production and fielding in FY16-18 and Engineering Change Proposal 1 retrofits in FY19-22 and Engineering Change Proposal 2 (ECP 2) retrofits in FY19-22.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 1 effort will buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to eleven years of war (20-combat rotations &amp; 37+ million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  

On 2 July 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker Operational Needs Statement (ONS) Lethality effort.  ONS Lethality Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contracts for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Logistics Products Development/Test Support were awarded in Jan 2016 and May 2016, respectively (Cost Plus Incentive-Fee basis).  The ONS Lethality Production/Retrofit contract was awarded in May 2016 through an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).  Definitization of the Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Production contract occurred in March 2017.

The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approval to initiate the ECP2 effort was received in a 30 September 2016 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                        <r2:Text>The Army plans to use 6 LAV-25A2s in a training excursion to inform operational concepts for Airborne Infantry Brigade Combat Teams in support of Global Response Force early entry operation and to determine airdrop feasibility.  XVIII Airborne Corps will have an opportunity to assess operational employment of LAV-25A2s, develop tactics, techniques and procedures and assess the air drop feasibility through air certification testing.  The Army plans to determine whether or not to field additional LAV-25A2s to XVIII Airborne Corps based on results of the excursion and air drop testing.  

In FY2018 the Army will complete air certification testing to determine LAV-25A2 airdrop feasibility.  If the excursion is successful and the Army decides to field additional vehicles it is anticipated that additional modifications and testing will be required to address upgrades to survivability, mobility, integrate Army communications equipment and add obsolescence upgrades for commonality with USMC fielded systems.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The current Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) is an ACAT1C Acquisition program. The PIM improvement program is intended to address the current Howitzer capability gap based on a capability needs assessment performed by the user community to restore indirect fires support overmatch to the US Army.  This effort will evaluate developing technologies to determine which configuration will add optimal value to the Army.   This effort may include but is not limited to the integration of a new cannon, gun mount, gun drive systems, fire control systems and autoloader into the M109A7 Howitzer.  Analysis will be required to evaluate the impact of the new cannon technology on current platform chassis, cab, suspension, mobility, and electronic architecture.  This evaluation will be the foundation for this Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and further inform the level of effort needed to integrate this capability into the current SPHS.  This program is a new start in FY18.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Each upgrade package will be evaluated for cost, technology readiness and added performance.  At the conclusion of the CBA the Army will be better informed to choose a path which can be sole source with the current vendor, open competition, or continue with government development through Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD).  This work effort is to pursue Objective Indirect Fire Range Requirement in the current M109 FOV Capability Production Document (CPD).  The effort will address increased range requirements from a holisitic development process.  Program will focus on gun mount, breech, tube, and fire control.  It will be designed around M109A7 objective requirements for range. It is intended to address capability gaps as identified by the Army Chief of Staff.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MQ-1C Gray Eagle provides the Army with an extended range, multi-purpose (ERMP) unmanned aircraft system (UAS); capable of executing reconnaissance, security, attack, and intelligence collection missions in the range of military operations (ROMO). Sensors/payloads include an Electro-Optical/Infrared/Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD), Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Hellfire missiles; providing a near all-weather mission capability. MQ-1C Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all Army Divisions, Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities.

The MQ-1C Gray Eagle Modification/Product Improvement Program (PIP) funding is required for the implementation of the Alternate Munition integration, Global Positioning System (GPS) Denied, an electronic warfare capability, Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) improvements, and Ground Based Sense And Avoid (GBSAA) Block II.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Aircraft Modification/Product Improvement funding of $39.358 million will support the development required to integrate Alternate Munition, GPS Denied, and UGCS Improvements into the MQ-1C Gray Eagle product. GBSAA Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) will provide development, integration and testing for Block II. This moves the GBSAA display into the UGCS to provide information to the aircraft operator to include maneuver recommendations necessary to avoid intruder aircraft.  Adds capabilities to minimize operator workload and combines two operator screens onto one display to shrink footprint. Block II decreases operational and sustainment costs, operator workload, hardware/software costs, increases system safety, and provides full materiel release for soldier operation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

MQ-1C Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all Army Divisions, Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities.

The MQ-1C Gray Eagle Modification/Product Improvement Program (PIP) funding is required for the implementation of the Alternate Munition capability, Global Positioning System (GPS) Denied which is an electronic warfare capability, Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) improvements, and Ground Based Sense And Avoid (GBSAA) Block II.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Aircraft Modification/Product Improvement funding of $39.358 million will support the development required to integrate Alternate Munition, GPS Denied, and UGCS Improvements for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle product.  GBSAA RDTE will provide development, integration and testing for Block II. Moving the GBSAA display into the UGCS provides the aircraft operator real-time information for evasive maneuvers.  Funding supports additional features to minimize operator workload and combines two operator screens onto one display to decrease logistic footprint. Block II decreases operational and sustainment costs, operator workload, hardware/software costs, increases system safety, and provides full materiel release for soldier operation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Horizontal Battlefield Digitization is a strategy that allows warfighters, from the individual soldier and platform to echelons above corps, to share critical situation awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) information. It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities. Digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, are used to provide an operational picture for leaders. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts; between joint and multi-national forces, combat material, and training efforts. 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software from a System of Systems (SOS) perspective. 3) Develop Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) programs into a single integrated system. 

Digitization efforts are in support of the Army Equipping Strategy, National Defense Authorization Act 804, and OSD reports to Congress.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) continued development and integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and the Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) into an improved, single system. Continued development of the suite of the AE2S applications is necessary to create and improve workflow efficiencies amongst various organizations and data base systems, Active and Reserve Component equipment transparency reporting requirements, and Active and Reserve equipment fielding plans to the Solider according to the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). Additionally, this program element funds various Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) projects that provide system engineering expertise to provide unbiased advice, formulate course of actions, analyze programs and make technical support and process recommendations to create efficiencies and improve systems.  Specifically, these FFRDC projects support Army Mission Command and network architecture (operational and systems) development, technical and policy document review in support of planning and acquisition, network and joint integration and interoperability evaluations and assessments, program and database analysis, independent technical analysis, special studies, and acquisition process improvement.  In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 804 and support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s (OSD) report to Congress, the Army is poised to implement an incremental approach to software development and hardware/software capability integration. This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, ground-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle.  The Avenger’s mission is to protect fixed critical assets and Corps/Echelons above Corps Maneuver forces from Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), and Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing aircraft.  Avenger provides day/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability.  

Funding provided for the Avenger PIP ensures that Avenger is viable and sustainable through the end of program life. The Avenger Modification – Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) keeps Avenger sustainable and relevant until replaced by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2- Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) in the Fiscal Year (FY) 31 timeframe.  

The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low- altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM). Stinger is deployable from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS. The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.

A SHORAD “shoot off” in 4QFY17 will evaluate industry solutions for mitigating the maneuver SHORAD capability gap. The intent is to determine which industry products that the Army could rapidly field to maneuver units between FY19-25.

Funding provided for the Stinger PIP addresses obsolescence, completes design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuse (PROX) into the existing Stinger Block I missile.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Avenger’s mission is to protect fixed critical assets and Corps/Echelons above Corps Maneuver forces from Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), and Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing aircraft.  Avenger provides day/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability. Avenger can be air dropped, lifted by helicopter and is air transportable.  The system employs up to eight Stinger missiles to counter aerial threats and a M3P gun for close-in ground and air threats.  The gunner can visually track targets through use of a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR) that can detect and track targets during the day and at night.  An on-board laser range finder provides range.  An IFF system aids in the identification of friendly aircraft in order to minimize the potential for fratricide.  The Avenger fleet has 170 systems that are equipped with a digital Slew-to-Cue (STC) capability to speed target detection and engagement.  Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command Control and Intelligence System (C2I) passes radar target information to the Avenger for display.  The operator can then select a target for engagement from the display, which will automatically slew the turret and place the target in the gunner’s FLIR field of view.

FY2018 Base dollars in the amount of $2.723 million provides funding to ensure the Avenger is viable and sustainable through the end of its program life. The Avenger Modification – Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) keeps Avenger sustainable and relevant until replaced by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2- Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) in the Fiscal Year (FY) 31 timeframe. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC), vehicle internal communication (VIC) system and the IFF will undergo upgrades to meet Information Assurance (IA) and operational requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low- altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM). Stinger is deployable from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS. The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.

The addition of a PROX to the current Block I configuration will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.

A SHORAD “shoot off” in 4QFY17 will evaluate industry solutions for mitigating the maneuver SHORAD capability gap. The intent is to determine which industry products that the Army could rapidly field to maneuver units between FY19-25.

FY2018 OCO dollars in the amount of $8.450 million support the continuation of design, development, test, and integration of a proximity fuse into the existing Stinger Block I missile.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The intent is to evaluate industry products that the Army could rapidly field to maneuver units between FY19-25. Candidate solutions must demonstrate sufficient mobility and survivability to support Armored and Stryker Brigade Combat Team operations. Funding supports the integration and testing of non-developmental items into technical solutions. The majority of funding will pay for test support activities including government and contract labor, targets, range support, and transportation of government furnished equipment. The assessment will take place in September 2017 at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>$26M addresses obsolescence and design improvements to the Stinger missile, including the Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) configuration. Funding addresses obsolescence issues in the Seeker Dual-Detector Assembly (UV Diodes), Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Roll Frequency Sensor (RFS), and the Electronics Assembly. These assemblies face Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and exponentially higher costs due to legacy materials and processes. This obsolescence mitigation will allow to Army to increase Stinger reliability and effectiveness while reducing costs as it dramatically increases the number of Stinger missiles inducted into the Service Life Extension Program. Developmental improvements include increased detection range, visual identification, and night operations capability.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary all-weather, surface-to-surface long-range artillery precision guided missile used by Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard &amp; soft targets in open, complex, and urban environments. 

788: ATACMS Product Improvement Program (PIP) focuses on safety, cost reduction, reliability, deficiency corrections, standardization, and new or improved operational capabilities. FY18 Base funds in the amount of $5.000 million supports operational testing, corrections of identified deficiencies, and fielding support activities for a Height-of-Burst capability via proximity sensor. 

DZ9: ATACMS Mods effort will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory. Block (BLK) I/IA ATACMS currently have warheads that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). Starting with a BLK I/IA missile, this modification effort will integrate, test, and qualify an ATACMS configuration to include a policy compliant warhead, obsolescence refresh, and re-grained rocket motors. Performance of a characterization effort will include qualification and flight testing to assess ATACMS performance with inclusion of a proximity sensor. Additional efforts include launcher updates to enable firing of the new ATACMS configuration. There is no FY18 funding.

VT9: Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) develops, integrates, and tests the Switchblade Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL).  Multi-Pack Launcher provides the capability to launch up to 6 Switchblade missiles remotely in a Force Protection Environment. The mission for the MPL is to be placed in a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in a constant ready-to-use state to enable Soldiers to remain in the safety of a building while launching Switchblade missiles.  There is no FY18 funding. 

045:  Hellfire Prod Imp Prog integrates the Longbow 7A missile, which provides increased seeker capability to acquire and attack a wider variety of targets, and integrates a blast fragmentation sleeve and proximity fuse to increase lethality onto the MQ-1 Gray Eagle Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  In addition, this program supports the integration with missile technical and software support from both the Federal government and the Longbow prime contractor and the upgrade of a limited number of Longbow missiles for integration testing.  There is no FY18 funding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all-weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments. This effort will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory. Block (BLK) I/IA ATACMS currently have warheads that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). Starting with a BLK I/IA missile, this modification effort will integrate, test, and qualify an ATACMS configuration to include a policy compliant warhead, obsolescence refresh, and re-grained rocket motors. Performance of a characterization effort will include qualification and flight testing to assess ATACMS performance with inclusion of a proximity sensor. Additional efforts include launcher updates to enable firing of the new ATACMS configuration.

There is no FY18 funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>No FY 2018 funding request.  PE0205402A has now been realigned into two separate PEs for Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) and Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C).  Beginning in FY 2017 Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) funding is now under PE0605033A Project EQ3.  Beginning in FY 2017 Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) funding is now under PE0605029A Project EQ2.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>GBOSS-E:  Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System-Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities and will provide network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. GBOSS-E will replace obsolete, quick reaction capability (QRC) surveillance and force protections systems utilizing modular configurations: Medium variant (mid sensor height) for small to medium size base, and Heavy variant (high level sensor height) for large contingency base camps. GBOSS-E will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.

IGSSR-C:  The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is an Automated Information System (AIS) program. IGSSR-C has a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities. The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE). This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations. IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.

Integrated Base Defense (IBD): The purpose of IBD Kitting is to harvest and refurbish physical security and Force Protection (FP) Non-Standard Equipment (NS-E) and package them into integrated and interoperable IBD Capabilities.  IBD provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base and Installation Protection (IUBIP) framework.  In support of JUONS 0540 to address the Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) threat.  Additional capabilities are being developed and integrated to the current Force Protection structure.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System – Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities along with network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. The G-BOSS(E) Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved May 2014. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. G-BOSS(E) received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015. Pending successful Milestone B decision in FY 2017, the existing United States Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and modified to meet the Army's G-BOSS(E) program requirements. The acquisition strategy for G-BOSS(E) was signed by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 11 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide system design, development, and integration support, as well as a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support future procurements. Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align G-BOSS(E), IGSSR-C, and Tactical Security System (TSS) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. 

The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems. The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013. IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) and Sensor CE efforts. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. IGSSR-C received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  The acquisition strategy for IGSSR-C was signed by the MDA on 5 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to develop, integrate and test the Initial Capability (IC).  No production activities are planned for FY 2017. Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)), Tactical Security System (TSS) and Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. 

The IBD acquisition strategy is to leverage existing IBD-related government organizations and to competitively award multiple contracts in support of IBD objectives for the development of holistic IBD architectures and products to support interoperability of fielded and emerging IBD-related systems.

FY17 funding supports IBD Kitting and JUONS 0540. Product Manager Force Protection Systems is overseeing the integration of both Commercial Off The Shelf and Government developed technologies that will address the identified capability gap to the existing Force Protection structure.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense sponsored program that was assigned to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health as the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in 2001.  The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders.  Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to develop a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment directed Chemical Management Enterprise Information Integration capability that will allow Army net-centric hazardous material and ESOH 2.0 NetCentric data management capabilities per the Secretary of the Army Directive 2009-03 "Army Data Management" and DoD Directive 8320.2 "Data Sharing in a Net-Centric Department of Defense."  Prior to funding being committed, Army and DoD environmental information technology stakeholders meet to determine which high priority EITM interface requirements need upgrades to incorporate new security and other information technology requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware, software, interceptors (PAC-2, Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PAC-3 and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement) and Ground Support Equipment.  As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulation, integration and testing.  Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S)allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints.  Flight testing is periodically required for validation of the Modeling and Simulation as well as satisfying Army Test and Evaluation Command/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (ATEC/DOTE) requirements of segment improvements. 

PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.

Funding provides authority to identify, analyze, design and test materiel solutions to counter cybersecurity and electronic warfare shortcomings to all elements of the Patriot Air Defense Weapon System.

FY2018 base dollars in the amount of $78.926 million continues program development with the integration of missile and ground system software and hardware in support of complete Post Deployment Build-8.1 (PDB-8.1).  Continues the testing program to support the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) and system testing/analysis long lead activities for PDB-8.1 Development Test and Evaluation (DTE) and Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The ongoing design and developmental activities enable modeling and simulation infrastructure maintenance and upgrades coupled with end to end testing of the Lower Tier architecture against the evolving threat as an element of an integrated Air and Missile Defense system. This strategy minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  Lower Tier system development efforts enable further improvement of system capabilities against emerging and reactive threats.  Developing, fabricating and testing hit to kill surface to air missile and associated ground support equipment provides essential increases in battle space, accuracy, lethality and firepower to counter and destroy evolving air defense threats. These state of the art capabilities and enhancements require ongoing demonstration through a series of flight tests and modeling and simulation activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Projects EG2/EG3. GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) which has been developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy. GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production. GMLRS AW entered full rate production in FY 2015. The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.

The first increment was GMLRS DPICM. The second increment is GMLRS Unitary. The third increment is GMLRS AW. The fourth increment evolved into the Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) program under a separate program element. 

The GMLRS program will continue to leverage ongoing Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) efforts to extend range and increase survivability. The GMLRS extended range effort will be approximately 85% common with Increments 2 and 3.  It will extend the current GMLRS capability to 150 km and allow for potential future growth capability in the payload section.

The FY2018 dollars in the amount of $102.807 million will complete the testing and qualification of the Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS); continue qualification of key rocket obsolescence upgrades (including the M-Code compliant NAVSTRIKE-M upgrade); evaluate rocket pod improvements; and initiate the design, qualification and testing of an extended range variant of the GMLRS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army funded the development of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) increment under the EG2 - GMLRS AW project code. GMLRS AW has been developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) and service the same area and imprecisely-located targets. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.

GMLRS AW successfully completed the combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) decision review on 8 April 2015. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) quantity of 54 pods delivered in September 2016. Full Materiel Release occurred in November 2016. The acquisition strategy is to procure AW as part of the annual GMLRS FRP contract.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army continues to explore ways to enhance Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets and common components and to mitigate obsolescence issues under the Guided MLRS project code.  The Army is requesting funding for the following GMLRS Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) activities: (1) evaluation of enhanced operational capabilities to provide more flexibility across the target set to include increased range, flight performance, and end-game optimization; (2) investigation of potential life cycle cost savings through obsolescence initiatives; (3) development of enhancements to the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) common test equipment; (4) evaluation and development of technologies to enhance overall product performance and survivability; and (5) Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliance.

The FY2018 dollars in the amount of $102.807 million will complete the testing and qualification of the Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS); continue qualification of key rocket obsolescence upgrades (including the M-Code compliant NAVSTRIKE-M upgrade); evaluate rocket pod improvements; and initiate the design, qualification and testing of an extended range variant of the GMLRS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Project EG3 is intended to support, investigate, and develop alternative material changes to improve the GMLRS family of munitions as they are identified by the material developer or combat developer. This project also supports IM activities to improve the overall posture of the system down to component level. Two Insensitive Munition Propulsion Systems (Rocket Motor and Ignition Safety Device) suppliers will complete design and qualification, and the IMPS will be integrated into the GMLRS rocket. Design, development, and qualification of a side-mounted proximity sensor will provide a cost reduction initiative and improved area munition lethality. The GMLRS extended range effort will be a 36 month development and qualification effort leveraging existing contract vehicles where practicable.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 

JTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 1 and Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 efforts are included under PE 0208053A. JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Information Assurance Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

Information Assurance Development funding Implements and establishes functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and Information Assurance (IA) capabilities In Coordination With (ICW) the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future material solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of CS capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the Department of Defense (DoD) and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data IAW the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS , System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) for Army Capability Sets for CS/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks. 

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems. 

The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).  The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client (MGC) Nodes began in FY12 and must be completed by the EKMS Tier 2 sunset date of December 2017.  AKMS supports the transition to Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI). 
 
The AKMI is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM program.  AKMI supports DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI) and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the AKMS.  AKMI automates the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMI Program includes the MGC nodes, ACES and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small, Medium and Large.  AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern ECU’s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support CMI. 

The Crypto Modernization program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Network.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging CS/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure enduring Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms and keys.  Tactical radios using embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to modernize their cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms.  If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the implementation of National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures; integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Network. 

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing, installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camps and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization Strategy Plan. 

Implement, establish functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and Information Assurance (IA) capabilities In Coordination With (ICW) the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future materiel solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. 

Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of IA capabilities that will bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing secure information exchange of voice, video, and data IAW the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) Army Capability Sets for CS/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for the tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camps, and station networks. 

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and provides situational awareness of the cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with a common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Army Key Management System (AKMS) (501) realigned to Key Management Infrastructure (KMI)PE/Project (373140)(DV4) in FY17.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).

The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client  (MGC) nodes began in FY12 and must be completed by the EKMS Tier 2 sunset date of December 2017.

AKMS supports the transition to Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI).  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  Two critical components required for the transition include the development of the Mission Planning Management Support System (MPMSS) and the ability to support Over the Network Keying (OTNK).

MP/MSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling secure transparent provisioning of KMI products.  MP/MSS service is being developed by NSA but each Service is responsible for interface development and final integration into their infrastructure.  ACES is the initial target for the interface to MPMSS.  NSA will be providing additional capabilities and updates to the MP/MSS interface specification through technology insertions in the out years.  The Army must then adjust to these changes delivered by NSA.   

One of the major enhancement in the KMI architecture is the ability to leverage OTNK.  The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan/Mission Support System (MP/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to from the tactical edge up through strategic ECU's.  Within AKMS this capability will be focused on ACES and SKL platform.  ACES and SKL will act as an interim solution for all legacy ECUs to be recognized on the KMI network until they can be upgraded to be fully KMI aware.  OTNK developments began in FY2015.

To support this transition, a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine must be developed for the SKL platform.  The KOV-21 card used in current Army Tier 3 fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support the new capabilities being delivered by KMI.  Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated.  The redesign of the current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV-21 card as a technology insertion.  AKMS RDT&amp;E funding line 501 realigned to DV4 / KMI FY17 and out.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Army Mission Planner software will be integrated and tested with the KMI MPMSS API Spin 3 capabilities.  These installments of the MPMSS effort are a continuing effort to the base capabilities developed in the Army Key Management System (AKMS) program and will ensure maximum use of KMI architecture by Army's legacy End Crypto Units (ECU)s.  This effort will commence after KMI MP/MSS software code is completed and delivered to the Army.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management System (AKMS) is an ACAT III Program of Record (POR) under PL Network Enablers (PL Net E).  It is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA)'s Electronic Key Management System (EKMS).  The AKMS allows the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5M End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. 

AKMS was initially approved for Milestone III in FY99.  The AKMS System of Systems originally included Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Data Transfer Device (DTD) (AN-CYZ-10).  In 2QFY02, the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority approved the procurement of the Simple Key Loader (SKL) as the replacement for the DTD within the AKMS System of Systems (SoS) POR.  AKMS is a fully fielded POR that undergoes modifications to meet emerging operational needs.

The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI.  The Army's implementation of the NSA KMI is the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) program.  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  

The LCMS component of the AKMS SoS (AN/GYK-49) is fully fielded.  The LCMS is assigned to the COMSEC Account Manager/COMSEC Custodian.   LCMS most recent hardware refresh was completed in FY12.  The current software baseline is 5.1.0.5 with certain select accounts upgrading to v5.2 based on operational needs.  Further LCMS software releases are not anticipated.  LCMS workstations will be replaced by KMI Management Client (MGC) Nodes before the NSA mandated EKMS Tier 2 sunset of December 2017.  EKMS Common Tier 1 operations and Tier 1 operational support continues to be provided by CECOM.  LCMS hardware is sustained by CSLA until fully replaced by the KMI MGC.

The ACES component of the AKMS SoS (AN/GYK-33) current hardware platform is a Dell E6500 non-ruggedized laptop fielded to S6, Spectrum Managers and some COMSEC Account Managers at Battalion level and above.  ACES is undergoing a hardware technology refresh and will be replacing 1/5 quantity of laptops each year.  The current version of ACES is 3.4.  Software is released on an annual basis and coincides with the Capability Set delivery schedule.  PL Net E currently holds the software development contract.  As the Tier 2.5 component, ACES operates between the LCMS (Tier 2) and the SKL (Tier 3).  It links the key data from the LCMS with mission planning data for a single load by the SKL into the ECUs.  ACES will continue with modifications to support the AKMI System of Systems.  In order to support AKMI, ACES must be modified to seamlessly operate within the KMI architecture.

The SKL is the primary Army fill device and is the Tier 3 component of the AKMS SoS (AN/PYQ-10).  The SKL is fully fielded to the Army.  Army holds the sole full rate production procurement contract for the SKL, which is heavily utilized by other DoD and civil services as well as FMS customers.  The SKL repair capability is with the Original Equipment Manufacturer but TYAD is developing an organic depot repair support.  The SKL and its cryptographic engine are facing hardware obsolescence issues. SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine resolves these issues and lays the foundation for the Army's Next Generation Load Device - Medium capability.  The SKL v3.1 modifications will be made to the Army's existing fleet of the fill devices via a modification kit starting in FY15.  The KMI cryptographic engine is reliant on the CERDEC led RESCUE RDT&amp;E effort that began in FY14.

AKMS RDT&amp;E funding line 501 realigned to DV4 / KMI FY17 and out.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) funding line DV4 was established in FY2014.  Army Key Management System (AKMS) funding line 501 realigned to KMI funding line DV4 in FY2017.  AKMI supports infrastructure requirements in support of Key Management.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM program.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI) and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  AKMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  

The AKMI Program includes the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small, Medium and Large.  AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern End Crypto Units (ECU)s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support CMI. 

One of the major enhancement in the AKMI architecture is the ability for to leverage the various capabilities and services from NSA KMI.  The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan/Mission Support System (MP/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to from the tactical edge up through strategic ECU’s.  The objective AKMI capabilities will be found in all of the products across the AKMI product line to include MGC, ACES and NGLD family of fill devices.  NGLD family will be an enduring solution to bridge the gap until legacy ECUs are fully modernized.  
   
The NGLD Medium and Large are reliant on the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE), a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine that is currently being developed. The KOV-21 card currently used in Army Simple Key Loader (SKL) fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK. Redesign and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated under the RESCUE program. The current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion. The NGLD-Large technology development will start in FY2019.  The NGLD-Large development will provide the same capabilities as the NGLD-Medium, along with wireless (802.11) and additional memory (64 GB) requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>KMI Awareness initiative creates a secure, highly automated interface in providing future Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to legacy End Crypto Units (ECU)s.  This initiative will allow ECUs to receive, authenticate, and decrypt OTNK messages and increases WarFighter survivability by minimizing the need for Soldiers to travel to obtain keys. The KOV 21 card, previously in production through NSA for use in the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and the Secure DTD 2000 System (SDS), is nearing the end of life due to unavailability of parts. Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL and Next Generation Load Devices (NGLDs) are currently underway. The redesign of the current KOV 21 card is referred to as the KOV 21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV 21 card as a technology insertion. The KOV 21 Replacement will also address requirements codified in the NGLD CPD and the AKMI CPD that were technologically unachievable with the KOV 21 card.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is a Non Program of Record (POR) under Project Lead Network Enablers (PL Net E).  AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record.  The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5M End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. 

AKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12.  The AKMI Program will include the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family. Each component of the AKMI Program is in a different phase of the acquisition cycle.  

The NSA KMI Program is replacing the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI by a sunset date of December 2017.  Components of the AKMI Program will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS program while others will be developed and fielded to meet AKMI requirements.  

The NGLD family of devices will become the primary Army fill devices and Tier 3 component of the AKMI Program. The NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 4QFY13. The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 3 devices (small, medium, and large) to meet the AKMI requirements. The AKMI program has partnered with RDECOM CERDEC to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE). The Army will gain the NGLD Medium capability through the SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the RESCUE, the first iteration of the RESCUE being
the KOV-21 Replacement. The redesign of the current SKL cryptographic engine, the KOV-21 card, is required due to parts obsolescence and inability to be KMI Aware. The KOV-21 Replacement is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion into the SKL v3.1 which in turn meets the NGLD Medium CPD requirements. The NGLD Medium will be available in FY19. Additionally, the Army NGLD large strategy is highly reliant on the development of the RESCUE and will drive a materiel solution decision in FY19.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports using National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks.  

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

The Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is designed to investigate Courses Of Action, conduct a Material Solution Analysis, and execute upgrade activities to ensure all enduring Army communications and data equipment that employ embedded cryptographic hardware will utilize modern cryptographic algorithms and keys.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure enduring Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms and keys.  Tactical radios using embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to modernize their cryptographic capabilities by implementing the modern algorithms.  If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>User activity monitoring (UAM) automation/analytics will provide technical capability to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GCSS-Army is the tactical unit / installation logistics and financial system for the U.S. Army. GCSS-Army is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will track supplies, spare parts and organizational equipment. It will track unit maintenance, total cost of ownership and other financial transactions related to logistics for all Army units. This modernized application will subsume outdated Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) that are not financially compliant and integrate numerous local supply and logistics databases into a single, enterprise-wide authoritative system. GCSS-Army will be financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise strategy to be financially auditable. When fully deployed, GCSS-Army will affect every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, Logistics Readiness Centers (LRCs) and property book office in the Army.
GCSS-Army will modernize automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, and tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  Delivering GCSS-Army will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems that are not cyber compliant, resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), mission is to integrate Army business processes by providing a single source for enterprise hub services, centralized master data management, and business intelligence and analytics. AESIP is the principle GCSS-Army Business Intelligence system and will aggregate data for enterprise reporting. AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:

Enterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.
Enterprise Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.
Enterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. 

The AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that currently provides provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. 
Building on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence / Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers. Upon the completion of Increment 2, the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A(E)), Unmanned Aircraft System-Initiative (UAS-I), and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by GCSS-Army increments. GCSS-Army will provide the Army sustainment support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure management information that gives combat forces a decisive edge.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP). GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that currently provides provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. 
Building on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence / Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers. Upon the completion of Increment 2, the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A(E)), Unmanned Aircraft System-Initiative (UAS-I), and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by GCSS-Army increments. GCSS-Army will provide the Army sustainment support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure management information that gives combat forces a decisive edge.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) systems are joint program/project efforts to satisfy ground mobile requirements for each Service, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the National Command Authority, the combatant commanders, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other governmental, non-DoD users.  The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army LandWarNet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies. EMC supports Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forcible entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command.  

This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This effort finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) Netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and DoD Information Assurance Certification Accreditation Process (DIACAP) support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.

FY 17 funds support the continued systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the follow-on Wideband AoA, and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations.

FY18 and out funding will be realigned to 0103142A.FE2 to reflect the new Major Force Program 12 (MFP12) Space configuration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) extends the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) network to small company and team sized early entry units. The T2C2 system is based on combat proven capabilities and provides robust voice and data communication capabilities. The T2C2 systems will also integrate users into the higher capacity WIN-T network and extend that network to the tactical edge; T2C2 also enables warfighters in select small Command Posts (CP) (typically Company level) and select Army teams to send and receive time sensitive Situational Awareness (SA), Intelligence, and Mission Command (MC) information while At-the-Halt (ATH) in support of all Joint determined and defined operational phases.  These phases span from the initial Shaping Phase, designed to dissuade or deter adversaries and assure mission friends, to Deterrence, Initiative Seizure and Domination phases culminating with post maneuver Stabilization and Enabling of Civil Authorities enabling legitimate civil governance in safe and secure environment. FY17 funds are in support of T2C2 systems (Light and Heavy) Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) to inform a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision scheduled for 4Q FY17 (on track).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) program Acquisition Strategy (AS) is based on integration of existing Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Items (NDI) into new integrated systems fielded in the needed configuration for small teams or small unit Command Posts (CP) to allow these units to receive and transmit data. T2C2 will provide a high bandwidth tactical network extension for small unit CPs operating beyond line-of-sight from their higher headquarters and for teams operating outside the full tactical network architecture. The acquisition strategy leverages an existing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase III Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract supporting the commercialization of the preceding SBIR efforts. T2C2 will utilize a two-level maintenance concept, will be Soldier-maintained, and initially supported by Interim Contractor Support. An analysis will be conducted to determine the ultimate supportability path. This strategy will allow a capability to be integrated and delivered quickly to support a limited deployment of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units in FY17 required for Production Verification and the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E), with Full-Rate Production (FRP) planned for 4Q FY17.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective.  The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.  

FY17 funding will support test by the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) during Operational Assessment (OA).  The OA supports the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) Disposition Decision (FY18) to continue procurement and fielding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Due to rephasing of FY17 OPA funding into FY18/19, program has been restructured.  Initial Operational Capability met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Node (KEN).   Full Operational Capability (FOC) is 35 C-17s, seven KENs and 21 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN) and an airborne command post suite (CASPAN).  FOC is currently projected for FY20.  Planning to field an interim capability and conduct an Operational Assessment in FY17.

FY17 RDT&amp;E funding supports test by the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) during Operational Assessment (OA).  The OA supports the Milestone Decision Authority (MA) Disposition Decision (FY18) to continue procurement and fielding.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A): This project is the Army component system that directly supports the implementation of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems. GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools for Army Strategic and Operational Theater Commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during joint and combined operations in support of National Security. The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A was re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services (BCCS)/Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and Mission Command Workstation. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.
 
Army Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 provides Army leaders: Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and Coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management.

Fiscal Year 2018 Base funding in the amount of $0.316 million supports GCCS-A 4.3 software updates and Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) testing of the GCCS-A Bridge Effort in conjunction with Common Operating Environment. Certification testing ensures that GCCS-A Bridge Effort software is successfully configured as a virtual machine on BCCS/TSI and is interoperable with Army and Joint Mission Command Systems.

Fiscal Year 2018 base funding in the amount of $5.712 million will support the Army’s capability for unit readiness reporting, unit registration and force planning and projection activities to enable Title 10 reporting to Congress.  Specifically the funding will provide program and acquisition oversight, technical development and training support to enable the readiness and force projection capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCCS-A is modernizing to meet the requirements defined in the Joint C2 Capability Development Document (CDD) and to align with the Joint and Army Enterprise architectures.

In accordance with the Joint Requirements Oversight Committee (JROC) Memorandum (JROCM) 145-09 which states, "The JROC endorses efforts to develop and implement programmatic recommendations to support the "Do No Harm" Strategy", GCCS-A continues to synchronize and modernize along with the GCCS Family of Systems (FoS). 

The GCCS-A Modernization Strategy consists of two separate program efforts. (1) A Bridge effort, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III level and (2) a Modernization development effort for the Army's Joint and Strategic command and Control capabilities infrastructure software products. The GCCS-A modernization development effort will be in compliance with Joint Command and Control Capability Development Document (JC2 CDD) and Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). DRRS-A will continue to satisfy readiness reporting requirements from Army Readiness Division (DAMO-ODR). The Bridge Effort's acquisition approach consists of a support agreement with CECOM LCMC SEC as the prime software developer utilizing a mix of government and contractor support.

The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command System of Systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity to improve readiness among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 is a software only implementation of strategic applications and interoperability services that leverage the unified software architecture design (core infrastructure and selected common applications being implemented in the CPCE) that provides Army leaders:  Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management. Capability Packages enabled by AJaSC2 are providing Force Employment, Joint Force Synchronization, and Total Force Analysis.  The operational payoff providing the Joint Force Commander a linkage between Army Mission Command and Unified Action Partners, enabling Unified Action through integration with existing and future applications (including CPCE and MCE) and contributes to achieving Shared Understanding during Unified Land Operations (ULO) facilitating effective Mission Command. 

Current plan for Fiscal Year 2017 funding is to utilize 853K to support initial development design of Capability Packages. Fiscal Year 2018 base funding supports program level pre-Material Development Decision (MDD) activities including final design efforts, documentation required by policy and regulation, research and analysis, and Joint requirements validation process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The AMCUA initiative will meet the requirements to enable planning and share situational awareness within an interdependent enterprise services network comprised of Unified Action Partners (UAP) and sister service components to achieve integrated mission operations. The AMCUA CDP defines the Land Component-unique Mission Command (MC) capabilities that the Army will develop to enable unified action through integration with existing and future Joint and Service command and control applications. MC capability contributions will enable Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) Commanders to gain and maintain Situational Awareness (SA), make decisions, and exercise authority and direction via a flexible, distributive and seamless system.

The acquisition strategy for AJaSC2 consists of the development, testing and fielding of Capability Packages implemented over time and synchronized with Command Post Computing Environment infrastructure. AJaSC2 will utilize the "Information Technology (IT) Box" construct. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue as defined Capability Packages to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box. AJaSC2 strategy will consist of agile application development which will utilize and leverage existing and emerging technologies from Programs of Record and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure. The product development under this R-Form will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on development efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. 

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI)is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.  

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infra Red / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   

Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  

Project 123:   The UAS Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>MQ-1 PAYLOAD - UAS - A00020 was a shared Aircraft Procurement, Army (APA)  funding line for CSP, STARLite and Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP).  
STARLite (A01003), and CSP (A01005) are broken into individual lines within MQ-1Payload (MIP) (A01001).

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>STARLite SAR/MTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. Full Rate Production (FRP) was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform.  Based on Initial Operational test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results, STARLite is increasing its software capabilities to increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) and aligns SPE with the COE requirements. The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness. A competitive Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and begin the development of the software  improvements.  Integration onto the Gray Eagle will be done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI.

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) EO/IR/LD enables the Gray Eagle to meet a KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirement. The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. Full Rate Production (FRP) was completed June 2013. A three (3) year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform RDT&amp;E activities. The Enhanced EO/IR Capability Production Document, projected for approval in 1QFY17, defines additional KPP requirements for Full Motion Video (FMV) sensors.  The first KPP increases detection, recognition, and identification requirements which can only be met with the High Definition (HD) variation of the CSP.  Currently, select units have been fielded HD CSPs, with additional HD CSPs in production and retrofit.  The second KPP requirement is for the CSP to be a metric sensor with rapid and enhanced Target Location Accuracy (TLA).  The acquisition strategy for CSP in FY 2018 is to mature Software and Hardware efforts for CSP to reduce cognitive burdens on the Warfighter and begin to develop the CSP as a metric sensor providing rapid and enhanced TLA and through a sole source cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to Raytheon.   

The acquisition strategy is to complete STARLite SPE software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle; begin development of the CSP as a metric sensor enabling rapid and enhanced Target Location Accuracy (TLA); and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support to the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) to continue enhancing CSP's usability for the Warfighter to reduce cognitive burden by providing improved situational awareness, while providing multiple fields of view in a simplified manner through Hardware (H/W) and S/W improvements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigured to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Base funding in the amount of $1.480 million will be used to complete engineering corrective actions and regression testing from DT/LUT testing and preparations for TSP Block 2.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TSP is a threshold requirement for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS. The TSP program completed the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition with a period of performance that was completed in October 2015, and focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform, and integration and test of TSP software into the Operational Ground Station. The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program. 

The TSP program entered the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase with a Milestone C decision that was approved on 2 May 2014. The TSP Program LRIP contract award was based on sole source selection with a period of performance that was completed on June 2016, and primarily focused on the obsolescence of the EMD phase assets via the required Engineering Change Proposals, and the first initial production of 30 TSP Payloads in support of the Gray Eagle Platform.

The TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record capability. TSP Beyond Block 1 will address objectives and remaining deferred Block 1 threshold requirements as reflected in the approved Capability Production Document (CPD). 

Improved Gray Eagle (IGE)- Program Manager Unmanned Aircraft Systems(PM UAS)received a Congressional plus up of $49M President's Budget15(PB15) to procure Extended Range UAS which increases the CPD objective endurance requirements for the current GE configuration to an Improved Gray Eagle (IGE). TSP is scheduled for integration and testing on the IGE platform upon completion of the platform's Follow on Test Evaluation#2 scheduled 1QFY18.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/System Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support.  The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.

This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 in accordance with the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8).

The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. EMARSS will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. EMARSS will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four EMARSS-S (SIGINT). 

This funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full Motion Video (FMV); Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) radar; Line-Of-Site (LOS) and Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8).

This funding line supports non-recurring engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC), testing, and integration.  Funding provides for Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving International Standards. It also enhances aircraft communications, navigations and surveillance (CNS); aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) and the integration of the AISR mission equipment package (MEP) as well as obsolescence issues involved with the conversion of Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to the ARL-E Program of Record (POR).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Note: The Airborne Reconnaissance Low- Enhanced (ARL-E) RDTE efforts are found in the following two (2) project lines; 0305206AEH4 ARL ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH5 ARL Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02110 and AZ2050. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne Intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E CPD requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), EO/IR FMV, COMINT, on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through DCGS-A Enabled workstations. 

The development and testing of Long Range radar (LRR) is required to replace the current ARL Phoenix Eye Radar to increase performance and meet the improved requirements of the Appendix J Payload for the approved ARL-E CPD. The remainder will fund software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities.  The software will be added to the existing COMINT systems to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Base funding of $2.969 million initiates the new signal enhancement development effort for Signal 4 to develop software, perform lab test, and perform flight test. This funding line supports continued software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters. Signals for development can be fielded on ARL-E, Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), and Guardrail. 

Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 OCO funding of $15,000 million continues the new signal enhancement development effort for Signal 4, 4a, and 4b to develop software, perform lab test, and perform flight test. This funding line will also support the development and test of Signals 3 and 4 data and co-op capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Distributed Common Ground Systems - Army (DCGS-A) is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration. The core functions of DCGS-A are: the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities. DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE). DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. As new software capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of modifications will be integrated and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.

DCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) for FY19 fielding.

DCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission. DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment. The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle. This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.

The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based data center processing environments. The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored. This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems. Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, Follow-on Test &amp; Evaluation in 3QFY15, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Baseline throughout the Army.

FY2018 has no funding for Project 956.

FY2018 Base funding in the amount of $24.700 million for D07, DCGS-A, will continue the iterative software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires. DCGS-A will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi- intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities. This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE), while providing the incremental software updates required to remain current.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCG/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&amp;L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. 

DCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. 

PM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&amp;S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software and hardware integration for Increment 1, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Note: The Distributed Common Ground System - Army is designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced commercial capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be provided into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.

DCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.   This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) for FY19 fielding.  

DCGS-A provides technologically advanced Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  

FY2018 Base funding in the amount of $24.7 million will be utilized to identify the Army specifications and prepare to procure a data management architecture to meet the Army’s requirements for the Brigade Combat Team echelon and above to replace the DCGS-A Brain. The architecture will consist of a ingest framework, persistence store, egress data service, fusion engine, and a visualization framework. This will continue to deliver critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the use of modern commercial item technologies and advanced analytic capabilities. This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through the alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) and Joint Information Environment (JIE).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Note: The Distributed Common Ground System - Army is designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-A is an ACAT IAM, Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program. The DCGS-A program will consist of multiple software releases structured to meet DCGS-A User requirements.  The DCGS-A program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively provide and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment/hardware, providing low risk, efficient, time- phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army’s operational needs.

The DCGS-A capabilities under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the future DCGS-A requirements set. The DCGS-A will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.

DCGS-A is a collection of software packages (COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data. DCGS-A delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon’s intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A will deliver these capabilities by fielding software releases with incremental increases in capabilities with each release. DCGS-A is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons.  DCGS-A provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.

The DCGS-A software baseline will be updated and iteratively deployed to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements. PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, will align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk integration and test cycle times. The time phasing of planned content of each release will be based upon an assessment of available and projected technological solution sets. The DCGS-A software will be hardware agnostic so that the software can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment. This allows the DCGS-A software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons. The implementation of the latest COTS hardware procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, will result in significant cost efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005.  Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD), version 8.7 was approved on 17 Jul 15.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.  On 14 Jul 2015, the trigger Configuration Steering Board (CSB) concurred with the Course of Action (COA) to validate the revised requirement for the Echelons Above Division (EAD) Gray Eagle and grant authorities through a new Acquisition Decision memorandum (ADM) to pursue the extended range capable Gray Eagle configuration.  ER is an enhanced derivative of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS and closes the capability gap by delivering extended surveillance coverage which supports Army RSTA missions in excess of 34 hours.  ER’s extended range provides the capacity for multi-intelligence payloads, precision strike capability, and reconnaissance in support of Special Operations Forces (SOF), Mission command from Aerial Intelligence Brigade (AIB) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).  The Gray Eagle Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) acquisition strategy emphasis will be to complete Developmental test events (Environmental, E3, Transportability, &amp; Performance Tests) to define and address system risks, followed by a FOTE II for the IGE.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhance force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control stations.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.

A SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  SUAS is transitioning to a Capabilities Production Document (CPD) that will utilize existing RQ-11 and RQ-20 in a system of systems fielding concept, with a Short Range Micro (SRM) option under consideration.

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $2.191 million will be utilized for Program Management Engineering support and to meet CPD Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to continue the research and development required to identify and baseline the SRM prototype solution for the Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems effort. Options range from testing non developmental items produced by industry to researching what other government agencies have achieved in quad copter development and technology.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (TUAS) RQ-7 provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), and Force Protection.  In line with the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) three Shadow Platoons are being integrated into the Combat Aviation Brigade's (CAB) Apache Reconnaissance Battalion.  This will provide Aviation Brigades with Manned-Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) and enhanced Aerial Scout capabilities.  The RQ-7B Shadow has logged over 1,050,000 flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).

The full Shadow system consists of four air vehicles with payload, two Universal Ground Control stations, two Universal Ground Data Terminals, one Portable Ground Control Station with Portable Ground Data Terminal, Ground Support Equipment, two launchers, ten High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with trailer(s), and a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle.  Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF).  The baseline fielded payload was the electro-optic infrared (EO/IR), but half of those have been replaced with a Laser Designator (LD) payload.  All 104 systems required by the Army Procurement Objective (APO) have been procured.  In 2010 the Army G8 established an RQ-7B Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) MODs program.   

Justification:  Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 RQ-7B UAS Base funding of $12.773 million will be utilized in the following:  1) $10.654M will be used to continue modifications for the RQ-7B UAS, 2) $2.119M provides interoperability and enhancements for the One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT). The $10.645M for modifications of the RQ-7B UAS will continue development of the air vehicle modifications to allow operations in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment.  This is a phased, multi-year effort. Phase I (FY16) provided a trade study to determine the best hardware and software alternatives.  Phase II (FY16) initiated the design and development through preliminary design review. Phase III (FY17) will complete design and development through critical design review and conduct engineering flight testing. Phase IV (FY18) will complete development, qualification, and developmental testing.  RDTE also provides interoperability modifications that support Manned Unmanned Teaming with the AH-64 Apache Helicopter, and Test and Evaluation to support the capability improvements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors.  The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS.  A successful Milestone II Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) was conducted 21 Dec 1999 and a Milestone III Decision was reached on 25 Sep 2002.  The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 2002 and in FY2009 the last of the authorized 104 systems was placed on contract.  Continued development of the selected Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Shadow v2,  Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Block III engine, and reliability upgrades.  Development/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on an engineering services contract with Shadow contractors.  Development of the Block III engine is being accomplished through a competitive process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Product Lead Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) manages two Army biometric tactical collection devices, the Biometric Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) Kit and BAT-A Handheld (HH).  These two devices support the Army Force Protection Mission and Identity Dominance Mission.  The BAT-A system is the Army’s biometric tactical collection devices which collect, match, store, and share biometric and contextual information on Known &amp; Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A devices are also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police).   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone and other OCONUS contingency operations for the past decade.  The current BAT-A systems will serve as the Army biometrics enduring capability through FY22.  All research and development efforts are now concluded for BAT-A.  PL BAT-A will continue to serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility as the BAT-A is now a Post Milestone C program of record in sustainment.

The FY18 Base Funding of $2.537 million supports the program efforts to begin the transition phase from the current BAT-A POR configuration to the updated Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC) to replace BAT-A.  The NXGBCC will be a part of the DoD Biometric Enterprise to protect and support the warfighter and nation through global identity superiority. The NXGBCC shall collect, match, store, share, analyze, reference, and manage contextual data and biometrics.  This includes iris, fingerprint, facial images, palm prints and voice on Known &amp; Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals to inform the warfighter in a decide/act response.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners. 

The FY18 OCO funding provides continued support for Five Vigilant Pursuit System Sets (10 vehicles total plus equipment) are currently deployed in support of OFS and OIR.  The Vigilant Pursuit System currently consists of 2 vehicles with integrated Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages installed on MATVs. 

FY18 OCO Funding of $3.886 million supports developmental activities to create modularized, vehicle-independent and tailorable Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages that can be installed and removed in a matter of minutes on any vehicle type to meet specific mission needs. Specific activities include hardware development for critical hardware components that cannot be commercially procured necessary to refactor the Multi-INT capability packages to work on any vehicle platform and software development necessary to replace/upgrade open source code that is no longer current/viable and is therefore more difficult and expensive to maintain or completely unusable.  
	
Lastly for FY18, the OCO Funding of $2.150 million supports the development of new software code &amp; associated testing necessary to deliver an instance of the Biometric Intelligence Information Repository (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by NGIC specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for OFS and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) C2S cloud.  The new, more capable software will facilitate automated information exchange with complimentary community programs resident on the IC ITE C2S cloud to support the production of a Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) containing all available IC Biometrics and Identity Intelligence.  The Army will execute this funding in FY18 and deliver capabilities within 12 months.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY17 funding change of $1.750 million, reflected in the Request for Additional Appropriation March supplemental request, supports OSD(S&amp;T) effort to develop a portable rapid DNA solution.  This solution will meet the requirements of rapid DNA for JUONS CC-0548.  United States Central Command (CENTCOM) submitted JUONS CC-0548 on 11 Dec 15 for enhanced biometric capabilities to support current operations.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated 5 key requirements of JUONS CC-0548 on 3 June 2016 and identified the requirements as "key enablers" to existing JEON CCE-0008 (near Real-Time Identity Operations).  The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) assigned execution responsibility for the validated 5 key requirements in JUONS CC-0548 to the Army on 30 June 2016.  The Army Acquisition Executive assigned OPR to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors/Project Manager for DoD Biometrics on 13 September 2016.

FY18 Base funding of $2.537 million is the initial effort to transition from the current BAT-A configuration to an updated Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC).  The NXGBCC will support the Army Force Protection and Identity Activities. The NXGBCC will be a part of the DoD Biometric Enterprise. The NXGBCC shall collect, match, store, share, analyze, reference, and manage contextual data and biometrics.  This includes iris, fingerprint, facial images, palm prints and voice on Known &amp; Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals to inform the warfighter in a decide/act response. The NXGBCC is the successor to the Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army Program of Record capability. 

FY18 OCO funding of $3.886 million supports Five Vigilant Pursuit System Sets (10 vehicles total plus equipment) are currently deployed in support of OFS (two sets) and OIR (three sets).  The Vigilant Pursuit System currently consists of 2 vehicles with integrated Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages installed on MATVs. The funding supports developmental activities to create modularized, vehicle-independent and tailorable Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages that can be installed and removed in a matter of minutes on any vehicle type to meet specific mission needs. Specific activities include hardware development for critical hardware components that cannot be commercially procured necessary to refactor the Multi-INT capability packages to work on any vehicle platform and software development necessary to replace/upgrade open source code that is no longer current/viable and is therefore more difficult and expensive to maintain or completely unusable.  In addition, funding will support development efforts for modular open architectures to significantly reduce SWAP and enhance multi INT sensing, processing, collection and dissemination.

The remaining FY18 OCO funding of $2.150 million supports the development of new software code &amp; associated testing necessary to deliver an instance of the Biometric Intelligence Information Repository (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by NGIC specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for OFS and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) C2S cloud.

Specific activities include hardware development for critical hardware components that cannot be commercially procured necessary to refactor the Multi-INT capability packages to work on any vehicle platform and software development necessary to replace/upgrade open source code that is no longer current/viable and is therefore more difficult and expensive to maintain or completely unusable.  
	
Lastly for FY18, the OCO funding of $2.150 million supports the development of new software code &amp; associated testing necessary to deliver an instance of the Biometric Intelligence Information Repository (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by NGIC specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for OFS and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) C2S cloud.  The new, more capable software will facilitate automated information exchange with complimentary community programs resident on the IC ITE C2S cloud to support the production of a Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) containing all available IC Biometrics and Identity Intelligence.  The Army will execute this funding in FY18 and deliver capabilities within 12 months.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The FY18 RDT&amp;E Base acquisition strategy will solicit a contractor and will award a Technical Services contract.  The objective of this task is to obtain the data, analysis, and trade-off methodology for the Materiel Developer to use in order to meet the NXGBCC requirement via a commercial-off-the-shelf biometric collection and communication capability that is cost effective and fielded in time to replace the BAT-A system.  The primary activity that will be used to gather the data, analyze the data, and determine a trade-off methodology will be a technical study of commercially available biometrics collection and communications capabilities, using a functional and technical decomposition of the NXGBCC Capabilities Production Document (CPD) as the criteria set.  The PMO will work with the TRADOC Capability Manager to analyze the NXGBCC Capability Production Document (CPD) and determine the appropriate level of functional and technical requirements decomposition.  The current acquisition strategy is to award the Technical Services contract during 2QFY18. 

FY17 RDT&amp;E OCO acquisition strategy reflected from the supplemental request is for the current contractor to further develop and refine three portable DNA prototype solutions for JUONS CC-0548.  The contractor will be tasked to reduce the size and weight of the DNA prototype devices.  Also, funds will enable the contractor begin initial operational fielding and test simulation for an operational or military utility assessment. The planned delivery date of the prototypes is during 2QFY18.

The FY18 RDT&amp;E OCO acquisition strategy will continue to solicit a contractor to continue to develop activities for the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved Vigilant Pursuit Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to modularize the Multi-INT collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination hardware and software to enhance usability from the Soldier perspective.  A contractor will also be selected to finish developing and testing the I2AR capability to install and configure the capability on the IC ITE Cloud on the JWICS and SIPRNet domains.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network - Tactical Increment 2 (WIN-T Inc 2) provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability. The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven Government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated network management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams to Company-level through FY2018. Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining situational awareness and mission command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30-Megabit per second aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that transmission paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or lose connectivity. This capability offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks. WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep mobile and dispersed forces networked through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts “Colorless Core” technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the “core” of the network. The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.

Inc 3 developed NetOps software and NetCentric Waveform (NCW) updates will be inserted into Inc 2 equipped units.

FY18 funds support development efforts for Technical Insertions, support Operational Testing (Joint Warfighting Assessment 18), and support Next Generation Point of Presence (PoP) and Soldier Network Extension (SNE) efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The current Initial Production contract was awarded in 2010 for procurement of Low Rate Initial Production Lots.  Lots 1-5a were procured prior to the Full Rate Production (FRP) decision review. Approval for full rate production was granted at the Defense Acquisition Board on 11 May 2015.  Lots 5b/6 were the first full rate production lots procured.  Lot 7 was procured in 2Q FY 2016.  Lot 8 will be procured in 4Q FY2017 and is expected to be the final lot buy under the current contract. The PMO is negotiating a Follow-On Production Contract through alpha-contracting sessions. This Follow-On Production Contract will be used for Lots 9, 10 and 11 with additional follow-on contracts awarded to support the remaining program procurement requirements.  

Inc 3 developed NetOps software and NetCentric Waveform was tested at Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 16.2 event and will be inserted into Inc 2 equipped units.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) develops and demonstrates manufacturing processes that enable improvements in producibility and affordability of emerging and enabling components and subsystems of Army air, ground, Soldier, medical, and command/control/communications systems.  Initiatives within the PE result in cost savings and reduced risk of transitioning military-unique manufacturing processes into production.  Project E25 fosters the transfer of new/improved manufacturing technologies to the industrial base, including manufacturing efforts that have potential for high payoff across the spectrum of Army systems. 

Work in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with, PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), PE 0602303A (Missile Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), and PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology) and PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and efforts are executed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and appropriate Army Research, Development, and Engineering Centers (RDECs).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>FE1: Dscs-Dcs (Phase II):
This project provides funds to develop Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated
Mission Command Network and Systems requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DEWSS is composed of the
Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support
legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS
and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end
connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations

FE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE):
Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.

FE4 / Enroute Mission Command:  
Mission Description and Budget Item Justification:
Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations
with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC
provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth
support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information
regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective. The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the
latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.

Due to rephasing of FY17 OPA funding into FY18/19, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku FISA FOC (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC.

FY18 funding supports the Ka solution requirement of Wideband Global System (WGS) Terminal and Modem Certification.  The certification process will ensure that terminals conform to the minimum performance and operational control requirements as defined in the WGS Ka-Band Terminal Certification Requirements Document.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This effort finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and Risk Management Framework (RMF) support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 

JTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. JTAGS funding was moved to a new PE as directed by OSD to track Space Programs.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 will be completed in FY17. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. P3I Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 delivers stereo SBIRS Geosynchronous scanner capability and Pseudo-Link 4 (P/L 4) data. Spiral 2 delivers Cobra Brass and "Walkers" data (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-20).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 

JTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. JTAGS funding was moved to a new PE as directed by OSD to track Space Programs.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research's (ONR) mission is to ensure the technological advantage of U.S. Naval forces. ONR fosters scientific research necessary for the discovery, development and delivery of new technologies. Often this research is done in partnership with academia. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. This program includes support for multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of naval relevant scientific and engineering disciplines that enables the U.S. Navy to maintain technological superiority and for the university research infrastructure to acquire the research instrumentation needed to maintain and improve the quality of university research important to the Navy. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security. The Minerva Research Initiative is funded in partnership with the Office of the Secretary of Defense to support basic social science and multi-disciplinary research aimed at improving national security and international stability. The goals of this program are to enhance connections between DoD and academia and build cultural and foreign area knowledge on topics ranging from the mechanisms of radicalization to geopolitical power projection strategies in a multi-polar world. 

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Basic Research and systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind. The work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 1 (basic principles observed and reported) and TRL 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>DURIP funds are awarded to universities to purchase relatively high cost research instrumentation that is normally not included in single-investigator research grants. Individual grants range from $50K to $1.5M. Funding for DURIP efforts is awarded after the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) selects and announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billing occurs. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed. DURIP is a one-year program.</r2:Description>

Funding for MURI efforts is awarded after Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramp up during the summer months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and Department of Defense (DOD) objectives by speeding up scientific programs, by cross-fertilization of ideas, by hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and by training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI projects are five-year programs.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research's (ONR) mission is to ensure the technological advantage of U.S. Naval forces. ONR fosters scientific research necessary for the discovery, development and delivery of new technologies. Naval laboratories funded by ONR provide cutting-edge solutions and to Navy and national challenges. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program provides opportunities to strengthen the Naval Science and Engineering (S&amp;E) workforce capabilities through basic research conducted at the Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories. These research efforts address high risk/high payoff warfighter science and technological needs, as well as attract the next generation of researchers to consider employment within the Department of the Navy. ILIR also provides opportunities for advanced degrees, technical publications, presentations, and patents. The Science and Engineering Apprenticeship Program (SEAP) and the Naval Research Enterprise Intern Program (NREIP) summer programs encourage students to pursue science and engineering careers, further their education via mentoring by laboratory personnel, and participate in research, which can lead to employment within the Department of the Navy.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework.

This Program Element (PE) funds Basic Research and systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind. The work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 1 (basic principles observed and reported) and TRL 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation). 

Due to the number of efforts in PE 0601152N, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) was established by Congress in 1946 to plan, foster and encourage scientific research in recognition of its paramount importance to maintaining American naval power.  This Program Element (PE) addresses DON's basic research needs to target and solve some of the Navy's and national most vexing challenges. Basic research is the seed corn for new ideas and lays the foundation for new innovative technologies and future naval capabilities. This PE's basic research efforts include scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding of national security in the maritime domain and related aspects of physical, chemical, engineering, environmental and life sciences. Ultimately, basic research efforts lead to and support more advanced aspects of applied research in capability-related 'thrusts', which advance Navy and Marine Corps objectives in: Autonomous Systems; Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warfighter Performance and Protection; Weapons; and Science, Technology, Education and Mathematics (STEM) education and outreach. 

Decisive naval capability begins with Science and Technology (S&amp;T) research.  This PE ensures a robust portfolio of naval relevant S&amp;T and enables new technological concepts to maintain maritime superiority.  These investments are selected to meet research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research and defined in the Naval Research and Development Framework, which support Navy and Marine Corps near to long-term requirements.  Scientific breakthrough from this research become solutions to technical challenges via the Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) pipeline, and new capability options for the future in the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs) portfolio.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since its inception, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. In addition, ONR's S&amp;T investment portfolio supports National Naval Responsibilities (NNR) critical to the naval services where the Navy has historically taken the lead (ocean acoustics, undersea weapons, naval engineering, undersea medicine and sea-based aviation) to ensure decisive naval capability in the maritime domain.

This Program Element (PE) funds Basic Research and systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind. The work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 1 (basic principles observed and reported) and TRL 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Understanding atmospheric phenomena and their impact on the electromagnetic spectrum from the sea surface to space provides a significant warfighting advantage. Efforts include: Marine Meteorology and Prediction and Space Sciences. These efforts support basic research on process studies, fundamental observations, data discovery, and modeling in the atmosphere and space with the goal of improving the ability to predict the battlespace environment anywhere on the globe. Emphasis is placed on the marine atmosphere, the tropics, polar regions, the ionosphere and other areas where new understanding is needed in order to overcome predictability barriers that limit the accuracy of current forecast models. Efforts are underway to understand the interactions of physics between the atmosphere, space, land, ocean and ice, represent these coupled processes in models, and extend them across scales from local to planetary, with the goal of extending the skill of predictions to seasonal and interannual timescales. Recent efforts have also focused on the processes that control tropical cyclone formation, structure and intensity changes and phenomena that affect electromagnetic and electro-optic propagation in the marine atmosphere. Research results provide the foundation for improved global and regional forecasts of the operational environment and for development of next-generation coupled prediction systems.

Battlespace Environments

Navy operations in the littoral zone are affected by complex topography and air-sea-land contrasts and phenomena occurring on very short time and space scales. Research is supported to investigate key physical processes, clouds
and moisture phenomena in order to improve their representation in models. Efforts are focused on those phenomena that affect the predictability of parameters of most relevance to Naval operations (e.g. coastal meteorology,surface winds, visibility, refractivity, etc.). New and non-conventional observational data sources are explored through efforts that develop novel data assimilation methodologies in order to realize the full potential of such observations.  Systems are being employed which operate in or through the earth's upper troposphere, middle and upper atmosphere and the near
space environment where environmental supports are crude or non-existent,thus, efforts are supported that seek to extend the range of prediction systems to much higher altitudes. Research is supported to improve understanding of the physics of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, and to improve the representation of the interface between the troposphere and stratosphere because of its effects upon medium term weather prediction.

Marine Meteorology and Prediction

Research initiatives to improve the sub-grid scale parameterization of clouds, radiation and mixing in the marine boundary layer that developed several innovative new "scale-aware" parameterizations; transition these to applied research and directly into a new version of the Navy's global numerical weather prediction system (NAVGEM). This activity is scheduled to be completed in FY 2020. High-altitude airborne field experiments over major hurricanes during which an unprecedented set of high-resolution soundings covering the full depth of the storms were obtained allowed detailed physical processes to be observed for the first time.This activity is scheduled to be completed in FY 2020.
Results from airborne observations over tropical cyclones will be analyzed and applied to new and existing models to make a substantial improvement in the skill for predicting intensity and structure change in tropical cyclones.
Atmospheric process research will seek to advance our understanding of atmospheric and space processes ranging from the surface to space.  This includes marine boundary layer physics, air-sea-wave-ice coupling, processes affecting electro-optic and electromagnetic propagation, and better representation of clouds and moisture in numerical weather prediction models. A new research initiative will be initiated to focus on the origin, evolution and effects of Arctic cyclones that are poorly predicted but are believed to have a strong influence on Arctic ice.  Airborne observations over the Arctic from high-altitude research aircraft will be used to investigate processes from the stratosphere to the surface in order to improve their representation in numerical weather prediction models that can be coupled to the physics of the ocean and ice. 

Space Research

Geospace research will attempt to overcome key scientific and computational impediments to a future physics-based Navy ionospheric prediction capability recently identified as a critical capability gap for high frequency (HF) radio-wave technologies for electromagnetic maneuver warfare, by means of focused scientific research on key drivers from the lower atmosphere and thermosphere that are necessary to achieve short term forecasts of HF propagation globally. Heliospace efforts may advance our understanding of solar magnetic fields and how they influence the near-earth environment. High-energy space development will assist in understanding particle acceleration mechanisms in high energy solar flares by studying gamma-ray and neutron emissions that are measured in space.

- Develop the quality of the environmental products that are provided in support of war fighters and to more accurately assess the impact of the atmosphere on the performance of weapon systems, we must advance our basic understanding of atmospheric processes ranging from thousands of kilometers down to meters, including interactions of the atmosphere with the land, sea, wave, and ice. 
- Improve our ability to exploit environmental observations to help us characterize those processes more accurately. Navy operations are increasingly taking place in the littoral zone, where complex topography and air-sea-land contrasts affect the environment on very short time and space scales, as well as in the tropics and sub-tropics, where longer time scale oscillations and seasonal signals also affect short-term weather events. While today's numerical analysis and prediction systems are more capable of resolving and predicting highly variable phenomena than were the systems of 10-20 years ago, there are still processes that are not well understood, including, atmospheric clouds and moisture, that require further study to improve their representation in models. 
- Comprehend the distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere play and important role moisture formation as well as atmospheric visibility.  A growing number of non-conventional observational data sources require new and novel data assimilation methodologies to be developed before their potential is fully realized. Systems are being employed which operate in or through the earth's upper troposphere, middle and upper atmosphere and the near space environment where environmental supports are crude or non-existent. 
- Understand the measurements and predictive models are needed to mitigate these shortfalls. 
- Recognize the interface between the troposphere and stratosphere is gaining increased attention because of its possible effect upon medium term weather prediction. This is most convincingly seen in the influence of the jet stream on the trajectory of storm systems and air masses in the troposphere. Current analysis indicates that incorporation of correct physics at this boundary and assimilation of stratospheric data into numerical weather prediction models may be almost as important as the physical interaction with the ocean surface.

- Conduct deployment of observing systems in the upper troposphere, middle and upper atmosphere and the near-space environment to extend the range of prediction systems to much higher altitude.

                                <r2:Title>Science Addressing Hybrid Threats</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Naval expeditionary forces increasingly face the specter of hybrid adversaries using conventional weapons combined with terror, crime, cyber, information operations, etc. A hybrid adversary is flexible and adapts quickly to synchronize advanced state weapons systems, disruptive commercial technologies, cheap expedient homemade weapons, and a variety of novel tactics. The Sciences Addressing Hybrid Threats (SAHT) (formerly Counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED)) activity seeks to establish and nurture science to counter these growing challenges, while collaborating with and leveraging results from more traditional naval research portfolios. 

The SAHT Sciences program provides research for Naval Forces to fight hybrid threats, and adversaries in expeditionary operations. Naval Expeditionary Forces need science advances to address a range of Basic Research challenges that result from physical and operational environmental limitations so harsh that solutions push basic discovery and invention. Naval Forces able to operate amphibiously and in the littoral will have all of their capabilities exposed to degrading sea and land physical effects. Expeditionary forces operating austerely must be agile and lethal but will be constrained by size, weight, and power requirements and must be sustained across distributed forces covering large areas.

Complicating the problem context further is the nature of hybrid threats, and adversaries. A hybrid adversary can be state or non-state using a combination of conventional and irregular methods and weapons. For example a hybrid threat could use criminal acts in concert with conventional artillery and IEDs and in turn social media for combined effects greater and broader than the sum of the parts. These coordinated multivariate threats occur across the spectrum of conflict with a dynamic but unified strategy. A hybrid adversary is flexible and adapts quickly, synchronizing advanced state weapons systems, disruptive commercial technologies, cheap expedient homemade weapons, and a variety of tactics. The Sciences Addressing Hybrid Threats program seeks to establish and nurture science to address these threats not covered in more conventional warfare science efforts and in environments not researched elsewhere.

The efforts research focus include: physics addressing the electromagnetic spectrum for use in Command and Control and high energy physics addressing Directed Energy Weapons; machine perception, reasoning and collaborative behaviors of autonomy enabling numerous potential expeditionary autonomous systems; artificial intelligence enabling future Intelligence systems; optics, electronics, and photonics research to enable revolutionary spectral awareness in small low power sensors; computer and network science to enable expeditionary computing coupled with Data Science research to conduct data analysis; fundamental chemistry and materials science research to advance technologies to support sustainment; basic materials research to explore and improve armor and structural materials; electrochemical energy conversion and storage research to sustain the force; chemistry and physics to provide disruptive energetics for expeditionary Fires; and biology, physiology, and cognitive sciences addressing the Naval Expeditionary warfighters human abilities.</r2:Description>

Research will address the fundamental understanding of the underlying phenomena unique to hypersonic flight where extreme temperatures and other unique flow and material conditions arise. Areas of research include boundary layer physics in shockwave dominated flows around highly-swept or slender bodies, Aero-thermo-elastic and/or aero-servo-elastic effects arising from control surface actuation at high speeds, descriptions of high-speed boundary layer transition that unify theories across disparate external conditions, novel strategies for extending regions of laminar flow and advanced hypersonic aerodynamic design tools that incorporate modern predictions of transition pathways, freestream noise contributions, time/heating dependent surface finish effects, and unsteady aerodynamics. Ultra-high temperature materials, coatings, and thermal protection systems will also be investigated.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The ONR Basic Research Challenge (BRC) program was established in 2008 to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program. The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by Office of Naval Research (ONR) program officers and are selected for BRC awards. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In an Artificial Intelligence (AI)enabled maritime battlespace, the ability to fight at the speed of light will determine the outcome. The effective defense against threats increasingly beyond human speed, will enable U.S. naval forces to outthink, outmaneuver and outfight adversaries. This Program Element (PE) supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on directed energy, high speed weapon propulsion, Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor technologies, and Naval Precision Strike Operations. The goal of this research is to develop technologies and capabilities that enable Directed Energy (DE) weapons as well as defense against adversary DE systems; the development of vehicle and propulsion technology for high-speed weapons operating from Mach 3 to Mach 8 and beyond; investment in the areas of Electro Optic/Infrared devises and advanced sensors; and technologies that provide the navy of the future the ability to quickly locate, target, and strike critical targets ashore.  

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense. ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework.

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>America is a maritime nation with global responsibilities that require U.S. naval forces be respected around the world and decisive when it matters. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) was established to guide ongoing research to ensure the technical superiority of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. This Program Element (PE) addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms. The goal is to provide the ability to deter, or avoid engagements, and if necessary, fight and win against adversary naval platforms or weapons. In the event of conflict, naval platforms must be able to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability. Research is focused on providing technologically superior defense of naval assets and delivering warfighting capabilities at reduced total ownership costs for surface and subsurface platforms through investments in applied research in: a) Power, Energy &amp; Propulsion and b) Platform Design and Engineering. This program develops technologies for reduced observables technology and enhanced capability of naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost. The program addresses technology development to provide substantial improvements in energetic material systems and subsystems, primarily in terms of performance, but also addressing safety, reliability, and affordability concerns. The program supports mission-driven problem solving within the Naval Research and Development Establishment (NR&amp;DE) through agile and rapid prototyping processes, while also promoting implementation of a common, effective innovation process and language.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments). 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>America is a maritime nation with global responsibilities that require U.S. naval forces be respected around the world and decisive when it matters. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) was established to guide ongoing research to ensure the technical superiority of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. This project addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms. The goal is to provide the ability to deter, or avoid engagements, and if necessary, fight and win against adversary naval platforms or weapons. In the event of conflict, naval platforms must be able to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability. Research is focused on providing technologically superior defense of naval assets and delivering warfighting capabilities at reduced total ownership costs for surface and subsurface platforms through investments in applied research in: a) Power, Energy &amp; Propulsion and b) Platform Design and Engineering, This program develops technologies for reduced observables technology and enhanced capability of naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost. The program addresses technology development to provide substantial improvements in energetic material systems and subsystems, primarily in terms of performance, but also addressing safety, reliability, and affordability concerns.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little to no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  A goal of this activity is to provide these platforms with effective self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual, multispectral electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), electro-magnetic (EM), visual and acoustic or chemical sensors/biosensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multispectral detection and distribution of specific threat information.</r2:Description>

- Efforts will be carried out under a pilot designated Naval Innovations Process Adoption (NIPA) to emphasize the implementation of a common process and language to promote collaborations and facilitate the use of best practices to accelerate the delivery of capabilities to the warfighter.  

- The NIPA pilot is based on the proven Lean Innovation startup process adapted for defense innovation as Hacking for Defense (H4D). The H4D process employs an innovation pipeline composed of four primary steps, with each step lasting approximately 3 months, so that a prototype is delivered and evaluated within one year.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The U.S. Navy/Marine Corps team is the most potent naval fighting force in the world. Fundamental to their success are the technologies necessary for effective distributed maritime operations. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) combines knowledge of the naval mission with researchers to select and explore solutions critical to expeditionary warfighting needs.  

This Program Element (PE) addresses requirements outlined in the Marine Corps Operating Concept, which calls for Expeditionary Forces to conduct maneuver warfare in challenging, contested maritime environments characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information and electronic warfare. Additionally, an emergent operation stressor is the contested urban environment which exemplifies the characterizations listed above. The urban environment is one of the most complex terrains with physical compartmentalization and canalization, additional physical dimensions (subterranean and multi-story structures), crowded conditions and associated threat obscuration, communications challenges, informational and human aspects, and proliferation of observation and fires technologies. This environment requires capabilities addressing all the activities within this PE and while it provides many challenges, unique opportunities are also presented and can further shape technology approaches. 

These future challenges and portents demand robust technologies for the Marine Corps, but the technology options are constrained. They must have a lightweight deployable character, and the ability to operate in austere conditions with little fixed infrastructure or support while retaining the agility and lethality of an integrated maneuver force. Technology must provide full spectrum capability against robust and complex peer and near-peer adversaries while meeting Size, Weight, Power, Post limitations, and information availability within Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments. 

The approach within this PE encompasses ideas that support both revolutionary and evolutionary capabilities, and in this way considers and balances both "push" and "pull" aspects of technology projects. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity investigates robust, resilient, and secure networked communications pathways and capability that support an expeditionary force's distributed and disaggregated operations. Research supports both networked and local computation for communications that exploits the expeditionary forces close physical proximity to threats while mitigating shortfalls commiserate within Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments. Expeditionary forces must operate in the cyber domain and in addition to defending communications networks, vehicles, and weapons systems, are reliant on electronic controllers for basic operations and as such are susceptible to cyber attacks.

Technologies addressed within this activity include secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks; distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; improved capabilities in over-the-horizon, beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications and sensors; and software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture. Other efforts include power management, low detectability, conforming to Size, Weight, Power, Cost constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Force Protection</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This activity investigates new ways and means to protect forces and materiel across all operational settings, from contested sea-land surface interfaces to complex urban environments. The portfolio protects against adversaries' challenges such as guided-rockets and missiles, mobile coastal artillery, threat Electronic Warfare, and counter Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Mines and obstacles both in the water and ashore also complicate amphibious landings. The activity invests in vehicle survivability aspects that are exacerbated due to Size, Weight, Power, Cost constraints inherent to Marine Corps operation and the harsh nature of the amphibious environment. 

Technologies addressed include lightweight armor for ballistic and underbody blast protection, advanced sensors for counter tactical surveillance, active protection, and signature management. This activity also considers technology for payloads, packages and sensors that are needed by amphibious vehicles (both manned and unmanned) including mine counter measures; explosive hazard defeat systems; and obstacle and threat detection systems as well as technologies for improved protection for individuals against blast, ballistic and blunt impact threats.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Across the three technology investment areas of 'Warrior Resilience' (WR), 'Decision Making and Expertise Development' (DMED), and Operational Tools (OT) research will continue to focus on providing small unit leaders with effective training and tools to gain them the winning edge on the battlefield. These capabilities will provide information to the warfighter at the point of friction and with increased information flow ("the right information, presented the right way, at the right time") to aid cognitive reasoning about the effects of the battlefield - whether physical or physiological - and mitigation of negative aspects of combat. The WR portfolio will fund research into further understanding the necessity, and ability, to train front-line (infantry) troops for maximum performance. The DMED portfolio will research and implement state-of-the-art and science of learning-based training techniques to improve the development of small unit decision making expertise. The Operational Tools portfolio will increase the ability of the warfighter to process information and speed decision making by implementing novel data collection techniques (multi-spectral collection of signals across the electro-optical spectrum) and processing of these inputs for display - in real time, as the ultimate goal - directly to the individual who requires the information to make a timely, accurate decision.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>This R-2 Activity addresses the applied research associated with the Marine Corps' participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The objective of the work in this Program Element (PE) is to develop and mature technologies needed by the Marine Corps to initiate FNCs in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that can be commenced at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0602750N Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research, where the Navy's participation in the FNC Program is funded.  The FNC Program is structured to accelerate the transition of new technologies to the Fleet and Force.  Each effort is assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Funding for FNCs, which have Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of 4/5 to 6 and also have transition funding commitments from acquisition Programs of Record, are resourced in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development.  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) are resourced in this PE 0602131M, Marine Corps Landing Force Technology. ONR works closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces.

FNC Budget Activity (BA) 2 investments develop candidate FNC technologies in an agile fashion by exploiting technology advances that respond rapidly to naval needs. This approach facilitates an optimum response when developing and maturing the technology options that can be developed further in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD). 

The FNC Program favors a high level of collaboration.  PE R-2 activities are mostly organized by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Departments, which are tasked to collaborate with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors.  

A complete accounting of the technology candidates being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort funded in this PE is provided annually to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This activity investigates the practical discipline and real world application of the deployment, sustainment, reconstitution, and re-deployment of forces engaged in expeditionary operations.  Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  This includes efficient and responsive force sustainment, planning and directing logistics operations, logistics demand reduction, fleet maintenance, and expeditionary energy.  Expeditionary Energy enhances combat capability of expeditionary warfighters by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of energy production, storage, distribution and use. Beyond traditional energy efforts, this portfolio also looks at other issues, including energy-efficient behaviors and hybridization of energy sources. These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO). Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission- focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&amp;T investments.  

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense. ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this Program Element (PE), the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop high throughput dynamic wireless communications and network technologies critical to the mission performance and robustness of naval communications for widely dispersed, mobile air, land, surface and submerged platforms. These platforms are often Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum, harsh Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions. The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity. The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces. Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and RF challenged environments.  

The current specific objectives are:

Radios and Apertures:
- Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) communications. 
- Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.
- Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.
- Develop alternatives to Radio Frequency (RF) communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using Electro-Optic/Infra-Red (EO/IR) technologies.
- Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.

Tactical Networking and Network Control/Management: 
- Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations.
- Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.
- Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/Middleware Architecture in both Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. 
- Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop enablers for decision making and mission execution in order to achieve battlespace superiority. It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes. Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation. To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, recognizing activities, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty. Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for Consultation, Command and Control (C3) information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems. The Nano Electronics Technology activity is focused on developing ultra-low power, higher performance computing devices and components that are based on novel functionalities of nanometer scale materials and are enabled by improved understanding of nanomaterials, new devices and circuit design concepts, as well as new architectures uniquely suited for nanoscale systems.

Develop methods that support decision making in networked sensor management and allocation to ensure sensor assets are deployed in an optimal, or near optimal, manner. The amount of data that the decision makers are facing today is much larger than any time before in human history. In addition, the data is much more complex, heterogeneous and fast changing. Analysis of such large and complex datasets is beyond the cognitive abilities of any single decision maker. The aim of this thrust is to develop new methods for extraction and analysis of relevant information from large-scale datasets, and to develop new tools for distributed information sharing and decision-making.

The research being conducted by three projects in this area address Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD), and responds to warfighter needs for rapid, high confidence identification of air and missile threats at long range, using real time and non-real time threat attributes and intelligence information.

Current efforts include: 
- Extending a previously developed technology to discover features of ship signatures vulnerable to certain threat detections and determine how to mitigate these.
- Using models to determine the enhanced radar cross section of Hyper Velocity Vehicles (HVV) and provide improved prediction and interpretation from HVV flights for early detection/identification and performance evaluation of these vehicles.
- Efficient broadband two-dimensional high frequency transmit arrays for Over-The-Horizon (OTH) Radar to enable two dimensional transmit beam steering, adaptive transmit side lobe control and reduced prime power requirements for long range detection of objects in the environment.</r2:Text>

To perform early-applied discovery Research and Development (R&amp;D) to ensure Navy-Marine Corps access to critical space-associated capabilities on the ground, at sea, and in a contested space environment. Research thrusts include spacecraft R&amp;D in five strategic cross-cutting areas that lead to the fielding of systems which perform functions critically important to operations. These areas are: (1) Advanced Space Platform Technologies, such as development of new and prototype space systems that are tailored to specific threats, including technologies which reduce cost, mass, power and/ or extend on-orbit lifetimes, and sub-systems that advance propulsion and control capabilities towards precision maneuvering while minimizing fuel; (2) Next-generation Payloads and Sensors, including space robotic capabilities to address on-orbit inspection, servicing, repair, assembly, and mission life extension; (3) Connectivity for disadvantaged users that is rugged, high-bandwidth and space based; (4) Space Weather, and (5) Space Situational Awareness. 

Current efforts include:  
- Developing and validating models of cathode breakdown and plasma formation to demonstrate reliable, repeatable cathode ignition using plasma heating, which will benefit the Navy by enabling instant ignition within seconds for responsive, low-power operation aboard highly mobile small satellites.
- Developing a Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied satellite autonomous navigation system that can operate for years with no input from operators or external systems and still perform a useful mission; developing a simulation tool capable of predicting the change in the aerodynamic performance of hypersonic vehicles after impact with atmospheric cloud formations over a range of mission scenarios and weather conditions.
- Demonstrating the successful completion of a robotic assembly task using a formally stable haptic feedback scheme in the presence of communication latency that allows an operator to feel how the robot is moving, rather than rely only on camera views or simulations.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>U.S. Sailors and Marines underpin all missions. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled decision aides, autonomy, human-machine training, augmented performance, command and control and protective equipment will ensure their advantage in a complex, maritime environment. This Program Element (PE) conducts applied research to address Warfighter protection and performance concerns, including efforts that focus on advanced Naval materials, biocentric technologies, decision support, intelligent and autonomous systems, human performance optimization, training and education technologies, social and cultural, and biomedical technologies. This PE also supports the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Global mission to serve as the preeminent external facilitator for the Naval Research Enterprise. This is accomplished by establishing quality, relevant connections between the international research and development community, Naval fleet/forces, DOD, other US Government agencies and international partners.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>The Office of Naval Research Global</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Supports the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Global mission to serve as the preeminent external facilitator for the Naval Research Enterprise.  This is accomplished by establishing quality, relevant connections between the international research and development community, Naval fleet/forces, DOD, other US Government agencies and international partners.

Science Advisors (SA)
This effort ensures that the operational Naval fleet/force help shape the DON investment in science and technology (S&amp;T), develops teaming relationships to rapidly prototype, experiment, demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for Naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. The SA Program also informs capability-based war games using current and future technology to identify future capability strengths and shortfalls that assist in shaping the DON investment strategy. The ONR Global SA Program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the Naval Research &amp; Development Enterprise, and strategic development commands. 

International science
The ONR Global mission is also accomplished through PhD-level scientists located in Asia, Europe and South America, providing coverage in these regions as well as Africa, Australia/New Zealand and the Middle East. ONR Global scientists actively search the globe for emerging scientific research and promising technologies, collaborating with international organizations and researchers through liaison visits and grants in innovative applied research. The direct impact of this investment is to leverage international research during increasingly dynamic global interdependence and improve the ability to solve DON S&amp;T challenges through shared knowledge and technologies with partners. In addition, this investment builds global S&amp;T awareness to reduce the risk of potential technological surprise, and supports theater security cooperation goals to sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners.

International engagement
ONR Global also supports international engagement with partner nations through the development and maintenance of bilateral and multilateral relationships, international agreements, and other activities that promote RDT&amp;E collaboration and interoperability.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Freedom of maneuver on a global scale for U.S. naval forces depends upon assured access to the electromagnetic spectrum and the ability to deny adversary exploitation.  Electromagnetic technologies must fluidly deliver communication, surveillance electronic warfare and digital integration to understand, shape and defend the battlespace. The Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO/IR) Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. 

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense. ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this Program Element (PE), the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Specific areas of research include: novel optical architectures for affordable persistent surveillance to support search, detection, classification, identification and targeting functions; development of laser and passive mmW detectors for imaging through degraded visual environments (e.g., clouds, fog, haze and dust); low size, weight, and power hyper-spectral sensors for severely size and power constrained airborne applications; development of automatic algorithms for autonomously detecting and recognizing anomalies and targets using networked sensors and/or sensor platforms; novel techniques for Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) countermeasures to detect, track and/or jam sensors.

Electronics: 
Create and explore new concepts, components, techniques, and subsystems for the generation, and transmission of Ultra-Violet (UV), visible, and infrared radiation to support current and future Navy and DoD needs.

Electromagnetic Warfare: 
Work is ongoing to address the critical deficiency with respect to operations in brownout conditions. Infrared (IR) and terahertz technologies are being modified and integrated with the expectations that combining these two technologies an effective solution can be obtained.  Bistatic radar and imaging technology is being developed to extend surveillance capabilities and passively engage targets. A unique approach permitting rapid active scanning of a battlefield in the IR domain using a non-mechanically scanned mechanism is under development. This technology if successful will eliminate the multiple laser ball systems currently required to accomplish this same requirement at lower Size, Weight and Power (SWAP). Active work is also being focused on developing capabilities for high resolution, wide field of view sensors on modest sized Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) platforms. 

Materials and Chemistry:

                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop higher performance components and subsystems for all classes of military Radio-Frequency (RF) systems that are based on solid state physics phenomena and are enabled by improved understanding of these phenomena, new circuit design concepts and devices, and improvements in the properties of electronic materials. An important subclass are the Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), Microwave (MW), and Millimeter Wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems. Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems. These improved components are based on both Silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials. Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and Submillimeter Wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 Gigahertz (GHz) to 10 Terahertz (THz). The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off- The-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size. Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology.</r2:Description>

Electromagnetic Warfare:
Eight projects are conducting research efforts in this area to expand the surveillance and detection of adversary and own force platforms in the environment by developing advanced sensor and sensor processing technologies to increase Maritime Domain Awareness.

Current plans are to focus efforts on:
- Radar techniques for detection and identification of small Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAV) and to develop classification and identification techniques for addressing evolving DHS/USMC requirements for assessing this type of threat in tactical environments.
- Validate algorithms using innovative concepts from discrete mathematics to accurately predict ship radar cross section (RCS) so as better assess platform vulnerability.
- Innovative target detection and clutter suppression algorithms for ultra-high frequency SAR that exploits fluctuation and motion within the scene to provide wide-area, automated detection of small targets at long ranges.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop Millimeter Wave (MMW) and sub-MMW power amplifiers for use in Naval all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, and communications systems. The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size. Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at Millimeter Wave (MMW) and upper-MMW regime. The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor. Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.

The current specific objectives are:
- High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.
- Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.
- Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Assuring access to the global maritime domain is ensured by technologies that reliably and accurately sense and predict the ocean environment. Coordinated distributed maritime operations is only possible when timely, actionable information is delivered to commanders. This program element (PE) addresses applied research to develop and exploit tactical understanding of the ocean environment to maintain U.S. maritime superiority and ensure national security. Research performed in this PE transforms basic oceanographic, geologic, acoustic, optical and chemical research into predictive models and technologies that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE). The objectives of this program are met through direct observation of the ocean environment by shipboard, unmanned vehicle, drifting, profiling and remote sensing modalities, among others; assimilation of these observations into predictive environmental models; and provision of critical environmental knowledge to tactical decision aids.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework.   

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Applied research investments in this activity support the development and testing of littoral models, sensors, platforms (air, surface, undersea or space) and remote sensing algorithm development to enable prediction of coastal battlespace environments anywhere on the globe. Efforts include development of new sensors and ocean remote sensing to quantify littoral geophysical variables, e.g., bathymetry, shallow-water bottom types, waves, currents, temperature, salinity, vector winds, optical properties.  

Battlespace Environments:  Conceptualize and perform laboratory, field, and numerical modeling studies to understand and exploit various geoscience and optical environmental phenomena in areas that are scientifically challenging, require innovation, and are of interest to the Navy/Marine Corps. Encompasses the design, performance, analysis and underlying theory of field and laboratory experiments designed to understand geological/geophysical, biological, and optical phenomena (including bioluminescence), in the oceans and littoral zones, and to validate that understanding. To develop models that can predict bottom boundary physical, geological, geochemical, geo-acoustic and geotechnical properties in shallow-water operating areas requires:  a) an improved understanding of processes that generate and modify the shape, structure and physical properties of the seafloor and sub-seafloor, and its topography/morphology.  Includes efforts to develop new or enhance existing shipboard, in-situ, airborne, and space-borne sensors and appropriate inversion and though-the-sensor techniques to obtain, store, utilize, merge and/or exploit data and create operationally and tactically useful environmental information of the littorals and bottom. This includes specification and development of sensors, signal processing, inversion, and other analysis tools when needed. Surveillance of coastal land areas and waters is important to support Navy operations.  The Navy/Marine Corps needs include an improved use rapid, airborne characterization of littoral environments including time-varying coastal topography, littoral bathymetry, sea-level height, land and seafloor sedimentary structures as well as quantification of the influence of turbulence generated at the seafloor boundary layer on vertical mixing and stratification in shallow water outside the surf zone. 

Undersea Warfare:   Conceptualize and perform laboratory and field studies to understand and exploit energy storage and retrieval from the benthic interface and the potential to balance small scale and large scale intermittent power generation with power demand for persistent operation of marine sensors presently powered by batteries.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The Marine Meteorology activity develops observing technologies, predictive models, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems and Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that describe the atmospheric environment and its impacts on naval sensors and operations. This activity focuses on uniquely marine aspects of atmospheric science such as air-sea interaction, coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, Electromagnetic (EM) and electro-optical (EO) propagation, coastal meteorology, tropical cyclone (TC) prediction, and the use of remote sensing to obtain quantitative observations of atmospheric properties. Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity. Objectives of this activity are improved NWP systems and TDAs that provide nowcast and forecast skill at global, regional, and tactical scales for operational support, sensor and system development, and performance prediction.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Ocean Acoustics activity focuses on the impact of the natural ocean environment on acoustic wave phenomena in support of undersea warfare and underwater force protection operations. This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The littoral zone has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids. This activity will also focuses on efforts addressing research needs identified by Task Force Ocean that will enable tactical maneuver for the future submarine force. The efforts funded by this Program Element (PE) fall generally into two topic areas: Analysis and understanding of the impact of environmental conditions on sonar data, and the development of reduced order ocean-acoustic models to enable environmental awareness and prediction on forward platforms.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Physical Oceanography activity develops knowledge of the physics of the ocean to enable tactical naval use and exploitation of the battlespace. This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve Surface Warfare, Anti-Submarine Warfare, Naval Special Warfare, and Mine and Expeditionary Warfare operations. Oceanographic field research that uses active acoustic transmissions requires modeling of the acoustic effects of sound on marine life in order to meet Navy environmental requirements.</r2:Description>

Data assimilation development extends use of coupled modeling approaches to include air-ice-wave-ocean-land models. Studies develop new or enhance existing shipboard, in-situ, airborne, and space borne sensors and appropriate inversion and "through the sensor" techniques to obtain physical oceanographic environmental data, and to fuse and exploit oceanographic data to create operationally useful information. 
 
The testing of the Remote Ocean Sampling System for air-sea surface flux sampling will be completed following the deployments in the North Atlantic.  Efforts to develop advanced autonomy for the operations of gliders in extreme environments is also completed. Testing of gliders with turbulence sensors, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) with turbulence sensors will continue. Additional efforts develop ocean drifters with stable salinity sensors and high resolution turbulence sensors will continue.

Continue the effort to develop a capability to estimate global ocean forecast uncertainty from ensembles which will enable risk assessment with skill out to 30 days, providing the real-time assessment of environmental uncertainty anywhere on demand and risk analysis products that can be used as inputs to existing decision support tools such as risk quantification and mission planning. Continue the effort to develop a new capability for accurate and rapid characterization of the local ocean battlespace utilizing the ability of gliders to work in coordinated teams and 4-dimensional variation assimilation to maximize impact of the glider data in a high-resolution local forecast model for more accurate ocean predictions.

Testing of ocean instrumentation that features energy harvesting will be initiated.  The TOPSIDE software of the data server module will be tested with ocean data sets that are publically available and cloud computing and serving will be evaluated and tested.

Battlespace Environments: A program including field research on ocean processes and dynamics, ocean model development, and data assimilation from the open ocean to the nearshore and riverine environments is directed towards model system development and analysis. Model and data assimilation development is extending to the field of coupled models including air-ice-wave-ocean-land models. Encompasses the design, analysis and underlying theory of field and laboratory experiments designed to understand ocean environmental processes and phenomena. It includes model development to improve ocean environmental predictive capabilities, through improved physical characterization, diagnosis, efficiency and accuracy of these models in a variety of computational environments. Also includes efforts to develop new or enhance existing shipboard, in-situ, airborne, and spaceborne sensors and appropriate inversion and "through the sensor" techniques to obtain physical oceanographic environmental data. Includes effort to fuse and exploit oceanographic data to create operationally useful information.  The research is coordinated with operational customers to enable its rapid transition into operational systems.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Program was established by the FY96 National Defense Authorization Act. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP). The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&amp;S) serves as the OSD Principal Staff Assistant and oversees, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the DoD NLW Executive Agent.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the requirements and capabilities sought by the Services and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the most relevant non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment. These applied research initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objective of strategic competition by providing options to the joint force in pursuit of national objectives in legal or policy constrained scenarios, as well as complementing the use of lethal effects in complex combat scenarios, for example, in urban environments with large civilian populations. Ongoing NLW studies, analyses and exercise efforts with NATO and Allies also support NDS objectives to strengthen alliances and partnerships. Resulting capabilities facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for below lethal threshold engagements.

This program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect. Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric incapacitation, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics.

This PE funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Some examples of counter-personnel research include optimizing known NLW effectiveness and discovery of new human target behavioral effects which mitigate these Joint Requirements Oversight Counsel-approved joint non-lethal effects capability-gaps.  Other examples are the assessment and study of new NLW technologies related to: (1) increasing the range of current NLWs; (2) increasing their duration of effect; and (3) increasing the volume of fire associated with NLWs.  This includes developing longer range, more compact: (1) NL sound and light devices; (2) smaller, lighter, and more power efficient high power microwave systems; and (3) developing new non-lethal laser induced plasma weapons for long range counter-personnel and counter-materiel applications.  The objective is to further reduce non-lethal directed energy weapon system size, weight, power consumption, thermal cooling requirements and overall system cost while increasing counter-personnel and counter-materiel capabilities.  Continue applied research to characterize new non-lethal phenomena and assess new target human effects and weapon effectiveness, including development of dose response and injury correlates for new NLW technologies.  Continue concept exploration of novel NLW capabilities for integration into future escalation of force platforms.  Transition results to higher levels of technology development and demonstration as feasibility is determined.</r2:Text>

Specifically, explore new non-lethal effects and evaluate alternative innovative applications of existing technologies to address future non-lethal capability needs as escalation of force platforms. Some examples of counter-personnel research include further optimization of non-lethal human effects, and enhanced understanding of human target behavioral effects. 

Conduct applied research to characterize non-lethal phenomena and to assess target human effects and weapon effectiveness, including the development of dose response and injury correlates for new Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) technologies. Other research includes the assessment and study of new intermediate force technologies related to NLW effectiveness and behavioral response, such as advancing the understanding of Flash Bang effects on humans to support novel non-explosive alternatives to pyrotechnic non-lethal devices. Some examples of counter-materiel research include the investigation of novel intermediate force capabilities for increased delivery and employment options for applications such as vehicle and vessel stopping, and the further optimization of intermediate force materials for integration into future escalation of force platforms. Other research includes feasibility and design studies for high peak power radio frequency directed energy sources and other high power microwave directed energy technologies (e.g., lasers, millimeter-waves) with extended range applications and longer duration of effect. Other examples of counter-materiel research include the investigation and conceptual design of high power microwave technologies to enable improved reduce overall size, weight, power consumption, thermal cooling requirements, and overall system costs (SWaP-C) performance. Results will support the transition of viable technologies to higher levels of development and demonstration to further mitigate the JROC-approved joint non-lethal effects capability-gaps.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Undersea Warfare Applied Research Program Element (PE) funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization. Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments. Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the PE. 

The activities described in this PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security. Targeted capabilities are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders including combatant commands, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) and Headquarters Marine Corps and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum undersea warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines. 

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>ASW Distributed Search focuses on the development of technologies for the tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks, using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas, including along key transit routes to protect naval/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest, such as key US/Allied ports. "Search" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems; Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components; and active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technologies. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>ASW Precision Localization focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies which use information from surveillance or search systems to determine an area of uncertainty (AOU) relative to target range, bearing, and depth adequate to handoff to an attack system. Precision Localization employs non-acoustic techniques such as magnetic and optical sensing to highly localize submerged threats. The objective is to increase magnetic sensor range and robustness, enable deployment on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and increase optical sensing search rates. Efforts include the development of non-traditional tracking and advanced magnetic and electric field sensors and processing. These technologies will provide a decreased AOU size thus enabling the effective use of smaller, more versatile torpedoes as well as increased performance gain in detection, targeting, tracking/trailing, and homing via target acquisition and covert prosecution.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>ASW Surveillance focuses on improving detection, classification, and localization capabilities in large ocean areas relative to the capabilities of existing ASW surveillance systems. The related technologies support the conduct of covert, wide-area surveillance ranging from one day to six months. The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas, and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats, including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar, or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth, acoustic communications links.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) works closely across the Department of the Navy (DON) and Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces. From their beginnings, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have leveraged technology innovation to gain decisive advantage. However, breakthroughs don't happen overnight. Critical to sustaining the pipeline of new capabilities, is maintaining a priority-driven portfolio of naval science and technology (S&amp;T) to deliver solutions to known requirements, and experiment with potential game-changing ideas. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy. Specifically, this PE develops component technologies in the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program primarily to address cost, schedule and performance challenges in acquisition programs, accelerating delivery. The term Technology Candidate refers to component applied research efforts, which contingent on success, will continue development as FNCs in PE 0603673N Advanced Technology Development. Efforts in this PE are coordinated with related work in the USMC Technology Candidates Activity of PE 0602131M Marine Corp Landing Force Technology.

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Sea mines remain a significant threat to ships. In fact, fifteen U.S. Navy ships have been sunk or damaged by mines since World War II, almost four times more than any other weapon. The Mine and Expeditionary Warfare Applied Research Program Element (PE) provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea. This program strongly aligns with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. This investment will enable Ship-to-Objective Maneuver (STOM) and focus on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). 

The Mine and Obstacle Detection and Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic mine hunting and neutralization/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations. The activities described in this PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security. They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) and Headquarters Marine Corps and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and Marines. These efforts align with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&amp;E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains. 

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity focuses on applied research to enable longer detection ranges and precise detection and mine location with fewer false alarms in a variety of challenging environments. It supports Mine Countermeasures (MCM) related Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs). Efforts include novel sonar technologies for longer range detection and classification of mine-like targets, magnetic gradiometer sensing, electro-optic (EO) technology for buried mine identification, and sensor integration onto Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). EO sensor research develops algorithms to enable image processing for rapid overt reconnaissance from an Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Efforts include the development of processing, classification and data fusion techniques to reduce operator workload, and an expert system used to predict mine burial. Efforts also support development of MCM Mission Modules for Littoral Combat Ships. 

The program is strongly aligned with the Oceanographer of the Navy (N2/N6E) and the research topics addressed by this activity reflect the priorities for improved forecasts of the operational environment and the development and use of autonomous systems for the collection of environmental observations and continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable science at sea. Field research within this activity that uses active acoustic transmissions requires modeling of the acoustic effects of sound on marine life in order to meet Navy environmental requirements.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2020, the Applied Research Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development effort was realigned from Project Unit 0000 to Project Unit 2481 within this Program Element (PE).

The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act directed the services to realign Cyberspace Activity (CA) resources into individual cost codes, projects or program elements (PEs) in order to provide additional clarity and enhanced oversight of cyberspace pure resources. Within this PE, cyber funding was moved from Proj 0000 Innovative Naval Protoypes (INP) Applied Research to Proj 2958 Cyberspace Activities beginning in FY20, which was established to isolate and identify cyberspace activities.

The FY 2020 Appropriation Act directed ONR to establish appropriate projects for prototyping efforts to provide additional acquisition oversight, fiscal clarity and adherence to financial management practices. Within this PE, INP funding has been realigned from Proj 0000 Innovative Naval Protoypes (INP) Applied Research to new stand-alone projects as indicated below starting in FY 2021.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) portfolio includes efforts that solve problems and respond to mission requirements, as well as exploratory research for new ideas and breakthrough capabilities. Larger in scope, scale and risk Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) are selected for their high-payoff and potential to revolutionize operational concepts. The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the INP Program. These investments define the future of U.S. naval forces. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate PE, 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes Advanced Technology Development. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy. 

Information security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The electromagnetic spectrum is a key operational maneuver space enabled by continuous, real-time awareness of all spectrum activity.  This R-2 Activity supports spectrum dominance, which included efforts that focus on communications, surveillance, EMW and electronics to understand and shape the battle space. The ability to assure access to the full spectrum is essential for battle space awareness and threat surveillance/weapon sensor engagement. Technologies within this activity will provide for integrated and distributed forces capable of dynamic synchronized actions through interoperable forces by incorporation of autonomous/ disaggregated systems to increase flexibility and reach within the electromagnetic spectrum.</r2:Description>

AMOS will provide the Navy with a persistent Arctic presence and environmental Arctic domain awareness at a lower cost and less risk than manned platforms. The combination of Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) assets included in an AMOS node will determine the range, sensing capability and persistence of each node, and can be chosen based on need and Arctic location. Work under this effort will involve understanding the trade-offs and capabilities for the prototype system.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY 2020, the Applied Research Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development effort was realigned from Project Unit 0000 to Project Unit 2481 within Program Element (PE) 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) is a high-power, kinetic energy weapon capable of launching precision guided projectiles using electricity instead of chemical propellants. When released into the railgun, an electric pulse launches the projectile at speeds up to Mach 6. EMRG will bring new capabilities, increased capacity and improved operational economy to fleet operations at sea. With its increased velocity and extended range, the EM Railgun provides multi-mission potential for hypersonic missile defense, anti-air &amp; surface warfare, and naval surface fire support. EMRG is a multi-year effort in various stages of research and development within with the Navy's Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) family of RDT&amp;E programs. The Activity identified in Project Unit 2481 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development INP effort.

The efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Within this PE, cyber funding was moved from Proj 0000 Innovative Naval Protoypes (INP) Applied Research to Proj 2958 Cyberspace Activities, which was established to isolate and identify cyberspace activities.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project contains all Applied Research Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) investments that are developing new technologies for cyber warfare. Potential adversaries are investing in advanced technologies that will challenge our advantages in the critical information domain. Nation states and non-state actors seek to degrade our command and control capabilities, networks and computer systems. Cyber threats continue to grow and rapidly proliferate. Technologies developed in this R-2 Activity will enable the warfighter to take immediate, appropriate action at any time, against any desired adversary, target or network by assuring that autonomous, continuous analyses of intelligence, persistent surveillance and open information sources have, at all times, optimized the possible courses of action based on commander's guidance. Technologies within this activity will foster operational endurance and enable sustained operations and resiliency for warfighters and platforms through enhanced cyber security/protection.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>HIgh-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS) plans and associated resources are realigned from Project Unit 0000 in Program Element (PE) 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res into this new Project Unit 3416 effective FY 2021. This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>HIJENKS is a non-kinetic High Power Microwave (HPM) payload integrated on an airborne platform will enable the prosecution of multiple targets with area coverage across each target and open targets previously restricted due to collateral damage. HIJENKS increases operational access by disrupting land-based infrastructure facilities tied to adversary systems, decreases cost exchange ratios through non-kinetic engagement, and addresses targets previously restricted due to collateral damage concerns/moral hardening. It expands the competitive space in the electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt, degrade, and destroy critical electronic targets. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3416 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the HIJENKS INP effort. 

The efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Information security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Adversary military modernization and increasing contested domains require a shift in approach "...to strike diverse targets inside adversary air and missile defense networks to destroy mobile power-projection platforms. This will include capabilities to enhance close combat lethality in complex terrain." The Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST) effort will develop and deliver autonomy, C2 architecture, and a series of modular payloads on a robust, scalable, flexible, multifunctional UAV system; employable from surface, sub-surface, airborne, and ground manned and un-manned systems to provide a dispersed, resilient, and adaptive capability to gain a competitive military advantage.  LOCUST will provide ISR and precision loitering munitions capable of being launched from air, surface, ground, and sub-surface platforms to conduct both singular and swarm operations across battlespace in conjunction with Joint and manned operations. It will demonstrate multi-domain launch and strike operations, heterogeneous air platform payloads, unmanned from unmanned operations, distributed control of the strike mission, and refined cost elements for critical technologies that have supply chain assurance addressed. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3423 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the LOCUST INP effort.

The efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

In order to further the goals of the C3A research area, the LOCUST program will continue development of autonomy algorithms (such as multi-agent multi-objective optimization, auction processes, and consensus-based particle filters) that optimize the dynamic resources allocation and navigation and implies the determination of how to pose UAVs, task them with missions of fine granularity, and plan their future poses. In the area of C2, LOCUST will continue development of the nominal architecture needed for swarm control (a flying ad-hoc network or FANET) that is subject to dynamic channel adjustment as well as quickly-changing scattering, fading, and multipath effect.</r2:Text>

- Conducting at-sea experimentation to understand limits of two-way communications between AMOS platforms under sea ice in the Arctic maritime environment.
- Evaluating the feasibility of Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) docking and recharge capabilities in the Arctic domain.
- Improving the reliability of candidate AMOS nodes, platforms, and sensors for extended duration deployment in Arctic conditions.
- Assessing designs of under-ice acoustic navigation systems using results from prior at-sea experiments.
These technologies are a critical component of achieving persistence, and thus feasibility, by unmanned systems operating in harsh environments like the Arctic.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CLAWS INP effort will develop an autonomous unmanned undersea weapon system capable of providing offensive effects to the Combatant Commanders beyond Phase 0 inside the first island chain. It will clandestinely extend the reach of large UUVs and increase the mission areas into kinetic effects. CLAWS will deliver algorithms to enable all families of UUVs to operate in complex, dynamic and degraded environments. CLAWS will demonstrate autonomous missions in denied waters, develop and demonstrate autonomous technologies for survivability of large UUVs, and develop autonomy and launch capabilities for special mission payloads. CLAWS will be able to complete missions 1&amp;2 against near peer adversary defenses, maintain critical communication with Navy C2/Fires and provide critical ISR information. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3451 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the CLAWS INP effort.

The efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Complex multi-domain threats can overwhelm the operator and individual platforms ability to defend the force. The ELEKTRA INP effort is developing "Human on the Loop" Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled algorithms to perform force level kinetic/non-kinetic kill chain optimization and coordination across multiple domains at machine to machine speeds to increase the lethality and survivability of the Force. ELEKTRA will demonstrate AI/ML ability to coordinate kinetic/non kinetic effects autonomously with heterogeneous platforms, the ability to operate in degraded environments for hours and the ability to coordinate and execute domain kill chains simultaneously. It will deploy artificial intelligent (AI) and machine learning (ML) architecture, neural networked computing and large data handling to enable real time, force level effects assignment, coordination and resource management. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3452 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the ELEKTRA INP effort.

The efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

                                <r2:Description>Complex multi-domain threats can overwhelm the operator and individual platforms ability to defend the force. The ELEKTRA INP effort is developing "Human on the Loop" Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled algorithms to perform force level kinetic/non-kinetic kill chain optimization and coordination across multiple domains at machine to machine speeds to increase the lethality and survivability of the Force. ELEKTRA will demonstrate AI/ML ability to coordinate kinetic/non kinetic effects autonomously with heterogeneous platforms, the ability to operate in degraded environments for hours and the ability to coordinate and execute domain kill chains simultaneously. It will deploy artificial intelligent (AI) and machine learning (ML) architecture, neural networked computing and large data handling to enable real time, force level effects assignment, coordination and resource management.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Hypersonic Booster plans and associated resources are realigned from Project Unit 0000 in Program Element (PE) 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res into this new Project Unit 3453 effective FY 2021. This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy currently lacks the ability to demonstrate a ship-launched, DARPA-developed Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) Cruiser as the original USAF-RAAF air-launch effort did not address naval capabilities. Hypersonic Booster will develop a CVN-capable HAWC All-Up-Round (AUR) for air-launched flight demonstration that will require a 25% reduction in overall length to fit in a CVN weapons elevator. The goal from the outset will be to leverage DARPA-developed HAWC program for naval applications. It will flight test a CVN compliant, HAWC AUR to demonstrate airframe and booster propulsion technologies. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3453 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the Hypersonic Booster INP effort.

The efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Information security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV) plans and associated resources are realigned from Project Unit 0000 in Program Element (PE) 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res into this new Project Unit 3454 effective FY 2021. This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV) project will develop and test a 132 ft. unmanned surface vehicle with ocean-spanning range, months of endurance, good seakeeping, and substantial payload.  The vessel will have a high level of autonomy for independent operations under sparse supervisory control and have utility for a variety of Navy missions.  MDUSVs capable of deployed blue-water operations with operator trust in safe, reliable operation, long-range and endurance autonomous operations. This will create a new paradigm for Navy surface force, a hybrid manned/unmanned force, and enable new tactics in performing naval missions. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3454 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the MDUSV INP effort.

The efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Information security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Full Spectrum Undersea Warfare plans and associated resources are realigned from Project Unit 0000 in Program Element (PE) 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res into this new Project Unit 3456 effective FY 2021. This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FSUSW Project will develop new technology for offensive and defensive warfare conducted on the seabed, in the sea (i.e. subsea), and from the sea. FSUSW will address three thrusts identified in the Undersea Warfare Development Command's document, "Full Spectrum Undersea Warfare Concept of Operations (CONOPS)". These thrusts are: advanced offensive missions for submarines, subsea and seabed warfare, and distributed undersea warfare. Distributed undersea warfare technology will enable full participation of all undersea warfare assets in the Navy's Distributed Maritime Operations concept. FSUSW missions this Project addresses include Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Anti Surface Warfare, Strike, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Mine Warfare, and Subsea and Seabed Warfare (SSW). The FSUSW Project includes the Affordable Mobile ASW Surveillance System (AMASS) research and will leverage technology developed in the separate PE 06022792N, Project Unit 3450, AMOS. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3456 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the FSUW INP effort.

The efforts described in this Project address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA3 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev. INPs do not develop hardware for service use; rather they provide feeder technology that can be demonstrated in prototypes in the 6.3 portion of the INP program. Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Information security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) is for the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to cover corporate expenses including salaries, Information Technology (IT), Financial Improvement Plan (FIP) efforts, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Billings, and some of the day-to-day logistical costs.  The vast majority of these items represent fixed costs associated with Scientists and Engineers supporting the Navy's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Programs.

This Program Element (PE) funds Applied Research, which is the systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with mission capable, persistent and survivable Naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) in the areas of Platform Design &amp; Engineering, Power, Energy &amp; Propulsion, and Materials. The program develops technologies for enhanced capability of Naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost. It also develops new Naval air vehicle concepts and high impact, scalable Naval air vehicle technologies. The program also develops advanced technologies, critical to protecting naval installations, to provide seamless full spectrum protection against asymmetric attack by improving the ability to: detect and identify developing and immediate threats; shape our responses through improved situational awareness and decision making; shield personnel, mission critical facilities, infrastructure, and operating fleet assets; maintain essential functions; and sustain and restore critical services in the aftermath of an incident.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Navy and Marine Corps' sophisticated electronics systems place heavy demands on the electromagnetic spectrum to accommodate information flow, defensive and offensive detection, tracking, and weapon system engagement. In distributed maritime operations, each of these platforms provides a set of capabilities that can be further combined for progressively larger and more complex operations. The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, Electronic Warfare (EW) sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities. Activities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, EW, and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications/data links. 

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense. ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The U.S. Navy/Marine Corps team is the most potent naval fighting force in the world. Fundamental to their success are the technologies necessary for effective distributed maritime operations. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) combines knowledge of the naval mission with researchers to select and explore solutions critical to expeditionary warfighting needs.  This Program Element (PE) addresses requirements outlined. Additionally, an emergent operation stressor is the contested urban environment which exemplifies the characterizations listed above. The urban environment is one of the most complex terrains with physical compartmentalization and canalization, additional physical dimensions (subterranean and multi-story structures), crowded conditions and associated threat obscuration, communications challenges, informational and human aspects, and proliferation of observation and fires technologies. This environment requires capabilities addressing all the activities within this PE and while it provides many challenges, unique opportunities are also presented and can further shape technology approaches. 

These future challenges and portents demand robust technologies for the Marine Corps, but the technology options are constrained. They must have a lightweight deployable character, and the ability to operate in austere conditions with little fixed infrastructure or support while retaining the agility and lethality of an integrated maneuver force. Technology must provide full spectrum capability against robust and complex peer and near-peer adversaries while meeting Size, Weight, Power, Cost limitations, and information availability within Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments. 

The approach within this PE encompasses ideas that support both revolutionary and evolutionary capabilities, and in this way considers and balances both "push" and "pull" aspects of technology projects. This PE matures technologies emerging from PE 0602131M-Marine Corps Landing Force Technology to develop concept prototypes and initial experimentation to confirm feasibility in an environment relevant to operations. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project is organized into ten activities, the core of which is represented by the eight Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas.

Emphasized within this project are increased efforts to actively demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts. These demonstrations and experiments focus on the specific technologies, not necessarily their operational application, and vary based on the technical maturity of the project. This early technology exposure gives Marines a view into the future and enables them to use their imagination and innovation to envision novel employment of the technology and inform the acquisition process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity investigates robust, resilient, and secure networked communications pathways and capability that support an expeditionary force's distributed and disaggregated operations. Research supports both networked and local computation for communications that exploits the expeditionary forces close physical proximity to threats while mitigating shortfalls commensurate within Distributed, Intermittent, and Limited environments. Expeditionary forces must operate in the cyber domain and in addition to defending communications networks, vehicles, and weapons systems, are reliant on electronic controllers for basic operations and as such are susceptible to cyberattacks.

Technologies addressed within this activity include secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks; distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; improved capabilities in over-the-horizon, beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications and sensors; and software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture. Other efforts include power management, low detectability, conforming to Size, Weight, Power, Cost constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.

Further, this activity integrates and demonstrates enhanced communications and situational awareness capabilities in experimental and warfighting environments reflecting USMC operations. Advanced technology resources will be developed and applied to complement commercial, other service, and defense agency investments to produce a technology base addressing identified Marine Corps technology gaps.  Focus will be on developing component level prototypes and experimentation in relevant environments.</r2:Description>

Research efforts increase the reach, lethality, and capacity while retaining mobility and tempo beneficial to expeditionary maneuver warfare. Maintaining focus on Size, Weight, Power, Cost and Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments stresses the technical solutions available. This activity furthers the maturity of researched technology solutions by also developing the integration required to effectively demonstrate and test emergent capabilities. Achieving a true combined arms state involves a full systems approach for both kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities all driven by a holistic targeting capability. This activity develops technology for application on current and future expeditionary weapons. It includes, but is not limited to, the following technologies: fuze, fire control, targeting, launch/propulsion, lethality, and accuracy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Force Protection</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This activity investigates new ways and means to protect forces and materiel across all operational settings from contested sea-land surface interfaces to complex urban environments. The portfolio protects against adversaries' challenges such as guided-rockets and missiles, mobile coastal artillery, threat Electronic Warfare and Counter Intelligence, and Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Mines and obstacles both in the water and ashore also complicate amphibious landings. The activity invests in vehicle survivability aspects that are exacerbated due to Size, Weight, and Power Cost constraints inherent to Marine Corps operation and the harsh nature of the amphibious environment.

Technologies addressed include lightweight armor for ballistic and underbody blast protection, advanced sensors for counter tactical surveillance, active protection, and signature management. This activity also considers technology for payloads, packages and sensors that are needed by amphibious vehicles (both manned and unmanned) including mine counter measures; explosive hazard defeat systems; and obstacle and threat detection systems as well as technologies for improved protection for individuals against blast, ballistic and blunt impact threats.

Technologies in this activity enable Marine Corps forces to maintain operational tempo through a range of environments by avoiding or detecting surveillance and targeting capabilities before engagement; counter detection and targeting (e.g. long range sniper, urban shooter, rocket propelled grenades) and delay vehicle detection and identification through signature management/control.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This R-2 Activity addresses the advanced technology development associated with the Marine Corps' participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The objective of the work in this Program Element (PE) is to develop promising technologies emerging from the FNC technology candidates funded in PE 0602131M that have been matured to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs). Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0603673N.  The FNC Program is structured to accelerate the transition of new technologies to the Fleet and Force.  Each effort is assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment. Funding for FNCs, which have Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of 4/5 to 6 and also have transition funding commitments from acquisition Programs of Record, are resourced in this PE 0603640M MC Advanced Technology Demo.  Funding for FNC technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is resourced in PE 0602131M Marine Corps Landing Force Tech.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces.

FNC budget activity (BA) 2 investments develop candidate FNC technologies in an agile fashion by exploiting technology advances that respond rapidly to naval needs. This approach facilitates an optimum response when developing and maturing the technology options that can be developed further in this PE 0603640M MC Advanced Technology Demo. 

The FNC Program favors a high level of collaboration. Collaboration with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors is required. A complete accounting of the technology candidates being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort funded in this PE is provided annually to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Aid the combat development process by conducting 11 core wargames. Focus areas include the CPG supported Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) and Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment (LOCE). Create an effective collaborative wargaming environment that will increase the use of automated and analytical tools, and will provide the necessary quantitative and qualitative output for Marine Corps capability/concept development. Coordinate with the Marine Corps Systems Command's (MCSC's) Wargaming Center of Excellence to provide an encompassing wargaming ability throughout the Marine Corps. Focusing 15 to 30 years in the future, continue to offer top level identification and analysis of emerging asymmetric threats and opportunities. This is accomplished by capitalizing on a myriad of foresight assessments of future operating environments. Maintain insight and continue making contributions to support approved Joint Concept Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) and Emerging Capability Technology Demonstrations (ECTDs) efforts and warfighting concepts; intended to provide rapidly fieldable capabilities by using emergent mature technologies matched with innovative operational concepts. This includes furthering demonstrations with a high-altitude balloon-borne communications platform and continuing development efforts of distributed mobile amphibious (and ground) assault fuel logistics capabilities. The communications platform effort involves demonstrating and experimenting with the military utility of a resilient, low cost, effective, high-altitude balloon-borne communications platform that can be rapidly deployed to enhance warfighter communications capabilities. The fuel logistics efforts include demonstration and experimentation to build the concept of employment as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for inflatable, scalable, double-walled fuel storage, transport, and transfer systems for bulk fuel logistics.  Continue in the conduct of a multi-year effort to enhance situational awareness; Command and Control (C2); and fires and maneuver in the dense urban environment. Conduct experimentation events to identify changes in training, organizing, and equipping future forces and provide venues for live-force evaluation and assessment. Bring concept developers, operational Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and technologists together in order to discover, purchase, and assess new and advanced technologies that can aid in the implementation and refinement of the Expeditionary Advanced Base (EAB) concept. Additionally, by exposing technology and acquisition professionals to the concept, future development can be guided. Explore the use of modeling and simulation tools and techniques to gather, process, analysis, and utilize operational data in support of experiment development, execution, and assessment. Capitalizing on an OSD 2 year investment, provide organic, experimental opposition force capability (Red Team, Red Cell and Live Adversary Force). This will assist in providing a more realistic, adaptive, and cohesive enemy force/civil infrastructure for wargames, command post exercises, simulations, and experimentation events in order to support free-play, friendly force adaptation and decision-making skills.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>- Wargaming - Continue to plan and execute executive agent responsibilities for the Marine Corps Title Ten Wargame, Expeditionary Warrior, as well as other wargames to examine Marine Corps capstone, operating, and functional concepts and explore assigned topics.  A minimum of 11 wargames will be conducted (4 large, 5 medium, and 2 small); all examining concept and combat development issues, experimentation, and other assigned topics.  Establish a stand-alone Wargame Network (develop, test, train, and operate) that provides visualization support (tools, methods, and procedures) as well as modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities during wargames.  

- Emerging Threats and Opportunities - Continue to assess and analyze the future security environment; identify and analyze emerging threats; develop and appraise promising concepts, opportunities and technologies; and serve as a catalyst to stimulate thought and debate on issues of importance to the Marine Corps.

- JCTD - Continue to monitor and contribute to approved efforts that address joint and combatant command warfighting needs through the execution and demonstration of prototypes within two to four years.  The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes to affordably operationalize technologies that enable warfighters to explore novel concepts and to facilitate informed transition to formal acquisition programs.  Complete high-altitude balloon-borne communications and bulk-fuel logistics efforts.  Develop technology to enable barges/vessels to serve as distributed resupply nodes in support of littoral operations.  

- Exercise Support - Continue multi-year effort to enhance the ability of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) to conduct operations in the dense urban environment. Develop and refine objectives and capability areas to address challenges in the future operating environment.  

- Innovation - Conduct warfighter driven challenges to develop prototypes and foster innovation with the Marine Corps.  Reaching out to fleet organizations, engage entities and develop required capabilities for further testing and evaluation.  

- Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis - Expand the use of M&amp;S tools and techniques to provide analysis to support capability development activities.  Model and assess naval operations with a focus on current pacing threat and theater.  Provide analytical support to the Marine Corps Capability Based Assessment and Integration Process (MC CIP) and other complementary efforts.  

- Experimentation Opposition Force - Continue to demonstrate the abilities of a live adversary force.  Force provides a realistic, adaptive, and cohesive adversary as well as civilian environmental characteristics.  This concept strongly enhances experimentation and strengthens experiment hypotheses and objectives.  

- Autonomous First Wave - Initiate a multi-year campaign to assess an ecosystem of technologies to better understand and advance capabilities to ultimately increase the lethality and effectiveness of the warfighter on tomorrow's battlefield.  Efforts include, manned and unmanned teams capable of conducting military operations in complex urban terrains and multi-domain environments.  

- Joint Assessment Strategies - Initiate investigations to pursue a lethal, resilient, and rapidly adaptive Joint Force capable of defeating and deterring potential adversaries.  Experimentation efforts will seek to inform future warfighting architectures, address/solve identified challenges, and analyze the hardest military challenges facing the United States (US) and our allies.

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>The FY20 to FY21 increase is directly attributable to the following areas:

- Wargaming - Establishment of a technical staff for wargame planning, development, and execution.  These technical enablers are subject matter experts (SMEs) in modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), visualization, and network development, programming, setup, and management.  The increase in personnel, specialized equipment, and software will improve player interface, allow for increased interactive visualization, provide for more rapid and systematic wargame adjudication, improve qualitative analytic outputs, and identify topics for subsequent deeper computational analysis.

- Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis - Data driven assessment of Marine Corps programs through the lens of the CPG and force design. 

- Experimentation Opposition Force - Capitalize on ideas and strategies suggested by SMEs and provide opposing forces with combative equipment and gear to reinforce live-force experimentation.  Also provide equipment/gear/assets to aid with civilian interaction perceptions/realism.

- Autonomous First Wave - Initiate a multi-year effort to provide guidance, vision, and unity of effort.  Program objectives will feed and support live force experimentation as well as map directly to the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and CPG. Each Limited Objective Assessment (LOA) will portray a multi-disciplinary/cross-functional approach towards larger foci; assessing technologies at different phases of ship-to-shore maneuver and combat operations in an urban environment.

- Joint Assessment Strategies - Research and address an increasingly contested environment with rapidly evolving security challenges; highlighted by the emergence of major peer competitors.

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) - Investigate concepts, methods, toolkits, software applications, and ideologies to provide/promote AI support/use for MCWL concept based experimentation.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the FY96 National Defense Authorization Act. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP). The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&amp;S) serves as the OSD Principal Staff Assistant and oversees, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the DoD NLW Executive Agent.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the requirements and capabilities sought by the Services and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the most relevant non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment. These advanced technology development initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objective of strategic competition by providing options to the joint force in pursuit of national objectives in legal or policy constrained scenarios, as well as complementing the use of lethal effects in complex combat scenarios, for example, in urban environments with large civilian populations. Ongoing NLW studies, analyses and exercise efforts with  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Allies also support NDS objectives to strengthen alliances and partnerships. Resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for below lethal threshold engagements.

This program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation non-lethal capabilities and includes performing analysis, technology development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these capabilities. Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next generation non-lethal systems focus on long-range localized non-lethal effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Conduct research and investigation of intermediate force effects and emergent technologies with the potential to further address the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved non lethal counter-personnel and counter-materiel capability gaps. Specifically, explore new non-lethal effects and evaluate alternative innovative applications of existing technologies to address future non-lethal capability needs as escalation of force platforms. Some examples of counter-personnel research include further optimization of non-lethal human effects, and enhanced understanding of human target behavioral effects. Conduct applied research to characterize non-lethal phenomena and to assess target human effects and weapon effectiveness, including the development of dose response and injury correlates for new Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) technologies. Other research includes the assessment and study of new intermediate force technologies related to NLW effectiveness and behavioral response, such as advancing the understanding of Flash Bang effects on humans to support novel non-explosive alternatives to pyrotechnic non-lethal devices. Some examples of counter-materiel research include the investigation of novel intermediate force capabilities for increased delivery and employment options for applications such as vehicle and vessel stopping, and the further optimization of intermediate force materials for integration into future escalation of force platforms. Other research includes feasibility and design studies for high peak power radio frequency directed energy sources and other high power microwave directed energy technologies (e.g., lasers, millimeter-waves) with extended range applications and longer duration of effect. Other examples of counter-materiel research include the investigation and conceptual design of high power microwave technologies to enable improved reduce overall size, weight, power consumption, thermal cooling requirements, and overall system costs (SWaP-C) performance. Results will support the transition of viable technologies to higher levels of development and demonstration to further mitigate the JROC-approved joint non-lethal effects capability-gaps.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) was established to ensure the technological advantage of U.S. Naval forces. Pursuing this mission, ONR manages the Department of the Navy's science and technology (S&amp;T) research portfolio (Basic, Applied and Advanced Technology Development investments). This work includes the Future Naval Capabilities program, which provides technology solutions to known requirements, and often responds to cost, schedule and performance challenges in acquisition to accelerate capability delivery. 

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) 0603673N for FNC Advanced Technology Development have emerged from earlier research conducted in PE 0602750N for FNC Applied Research, and have transition funding commitments from the receiving acquisition Program of Record. Each effort in this PE is assessed and selected for its payoff to the naval warfighter, technological maturity and stakeholder commitment to deploy it to the Fleet/Force.

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program exploits technology advances and responds quickly to Naval needs. As a result, future Budget Activity (BA) 3 investments supporting the FNC Program are made less than one year before commencing execution. Because FNCs start at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), the typical duration of an FNC is 3-years. The FNC Program favors a high level of collaboration.  Program Element R-2 Activities align to warfare areas where the FNC technologies will be integrated into acquisition programs of record. 

A complete accounting of FNC technologies and a full disposition of each technology development effort is provided annually to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The advanced technologies being developed under this R-2 Activity in FY20 include technologies supporting the future integrated training environment and ready relevant learning. Training simulator software and hardware to support the rapid integration and interoperability of air and ground legacy and future simulation-based training is being developed to address the shortfall in sorties needed to maintain readiness for integrated air and ground operations of the marine air-ground task force.  This technology will allow pilots and aircrews to train effectively in a common, simulated operating environment. Flexible and interoperable learning continuum and performance aids will be developed, providing individual career management, skill classification, selection, automatic training content re-engineering, supervisor evaluations, and Fleet readiness tracking.  New machine learning algorithms will input training data from the lifelong learning record, and output a training model that is usable for adaptive training. The focus on ready relevant training will accelerate learning, reduce the decay of acquired skills, and provide readiness tracking of performance at an individual level.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>The advanced technologies being developed under this R-2 Activity in FY20 include those efforts that focus on Mine Countermeasures (MCM) task force planning, multi-mission airborne mine detection, and mine neutralization without collateral damage. Mission management tools will be developed for the Mine Countermeasures Commander to assist in the planning and re-planning, scheduling, and allocation of MCM task force assets using an extremely modular, open systems approach. This will provide MCM Commanders with the ability to rapidly re-plan and schedule emerging LCS/MCM Mission Package assets and maintain situational awareness of heterogeneous groups of systems. The investment in single-system, day/night, multi-mission airborne mine detection technologies usable at all water depths will be increased in order to reduce the MCM timeline and facilitate our capability to counter surface/near surface mines in the Surf Zone or Beach Zone (BZ) at night. The viability of the preliminary design and schedule to support Fire Scout integration will be thoroughly explored. New mine neutralization technologies will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Navy expeditionary force capabilities in their assigned response mission to counter naval mine and maritime improvised explosive device threats. This technology will enhance the capability of the Maritime Expeditionary Standoff Response (MESR) System of Systems.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Low Observable No Collateral Damage-Neutralization (LONCD-N) System:
- Continue activity on technologies for low observable mine neutralization without collateral damage. Specific effort includes subcomponent prototype construction, in-water experimentation, and initial data collection. These alternative mine neutralization technologies will enhance the capability of the Maritime Expeditionary Standoff Response (MESR) System of Systems and enable more clandestine MCM operations in support of JFEO.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research's (ONR) mission is to foster scientific research for the advancement of naval power. This work does not stop at the laboratory. Delivery of breakthrough capability often requires new technologies in manufacturing and supply chains of national security. The Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program is intended to improve the productivity and responsiveness of the U.S. defense industrial base by funding the development, optimization, and transition of enabling manufacturing technologies to key naval suppliers.  In general, investments transition emerging Science and Technology (S&amp;T) results to acquisition programs; improve industrial capabilities in production, maintenance, repair and industrial base responsiveness; and advance manufacturing technology to reduce cost, improve performance, and responsiveness. Currently, the ManTech Program is focused on affordability improvements for specific key acquisition platforms as defined in the Navy ManTech Investment Strategy.  Key platforms currently targeted include: VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS)/OHIO Replacement Program (ORP); DDG 51 Class Destroyer; CVN 78 Class Carrier; Joint Strike Fighter (JSF); and CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopter.  Office of Naval Research (ONR) ManTech helps these Navy programs achieve their respective affordability goals by transitioning developed manufacturing technology which, when implemented, results in needed cost reduction or cost avoidance.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).

Due to the number of efforts in this Program Element (PE), the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE supports the advanced development and demonstration of technologies to improve warfighter performance, safety and survivability. Naval investment in these areas is essential in order to improve the ability to enhance, maintain, and sustain Warfighter effectiveness. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Office of the Secretary of Defense Communities of Interest.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework.

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) guides ongoing research in the pursuit of innovative, decisive capabilities for our Sailors and Marines. ONR manages a broad, but priority-driven investment portfolio of near to long-term basic and applied research. This Program Element (PE) addresses the development of recent Science and Technology (S&amp;T) breakthroughs to meet current operational needs from a subscale proof-of-principle into a full-scale prototype for warfighter experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations including Fleet Battle Problems (FBP), Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) and Fleet/Force exercises. The key aspects of this PE are divided into five areas supporting the continuum of S&amp;T from discovery to delivery: (1) Naval Warfare Experimentation develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during operational demonstrations and exercises; (2) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions and inform future investment; (3) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (4) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level: and (5) support for the Naval Precision Strike Operations, providing the Navy capability to quickly locate, target, and strike critical targets.

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework.

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The objective of this activity is to capitalize on recent technology breakthroughs to develop and integrate components including subsystems into prototypes quickly. These technologies are provided to the warfighter for experimentation, field experiments, and/or tests in simulated or actual environments. The use of Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) events is encouraged. The net results are knowledge that only an experiment can provide and that will inform future Science and Technology (S&amp;T) development and transition of capabilities.

An example of Naval Warfare Experimentation efforts is funding participation of the SeaHunter Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessel (MDUSV) in a recent Pacific Fleet Battle Problem to determine its ability to conduct operations as part of a larger naval force transiting autonomously from California to Hawaii.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Operations Analysis</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The objective of this project is to provide operational analysis through studies, analyses, gaming, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), and experimentation to identify Navy and Marine Corps capability needs that can be addressed with S&amp;T solutions.  The effort includes core analysis of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) programs, military utility/capability gaps analyses, war gaming, structured experimentation events, the articulation of the results of that analysis and war gaming, and the development of innovation strategies and messages resulting from these analyses.

An example of an Operations Analysis effort would be conducting an Artificial Intelligence Technology Innovation Game (TIG) with the Naval Warfare Development Command and representatives from the fleet, force, and NRE to determine where application of AI can have the most significant, near term impact on warfighting capability which allows the NRE to more accurately focus its S&amp;T investments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>TechSolutions develops rapid response Science and Technology (S&amp;T) solutions to immediate Fleet/Force needs identified by individual Sailors at the deckplate level and Marines in the field.  TechSolutions links warfighters to the government science and technology community to develop needed technologies as quickly as possible.  Sailors, Marines and Science Advisors submit their issues throughout the year via the TechSolutions web portal.  Projects are initiated directly from such requests and a prototype solution is developed collaboratively with the warfighter.  Within 12 months the prototype is delivered into the hands of the warfighter and demonstrated in an operationally relevant context.  

Historical examples of technology requests have included an enhancement to weapons training for security forces that was satisfied by development of an Augmented Reality headset and instrumented weapons, and a request for automated video recording of interactions at sea that was satisfied by the development of 360 degree visible and infrared cameras and DVR for quickly generating reports with video documentation to transmit up the chain of command.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Explosive ordnance disposal is a critical naval mission vital to the safety of service members and civilians. Highly trained Sailors and Marines utilize their knowhow and courage combined with state-of-the-art technology to remove unexploded ordnance, land/sea mines and even chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. The Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5160.62 "Single Manager Responsibility for Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology and Training (EODT&amp;T)" approved by the DoD Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program Board (Sep 2012) guides research in this Program Element (PE). Unique needs and capabilities identified by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the DoD EOD Program Board are also addressed by this PE, and provide the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval and Joint EOD forces in the 21st century. The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions, DoD EOD S&amp;T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

This PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore. Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces. Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat. Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations. Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective. Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs. This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs. It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs). 

Today's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&amp;T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&amp;D Framework. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2020, three new stand alone project units were created for three Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) major focus areas to better consolidate and coordinate the acceleration of these efforts. The three project units are: 2480 Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM), 2481 the Electro-Magnetic Railgun, and 2958 Cyberspace Activities.

In FY 2021, a new stand alone project unit, High Energy Laser Counter ASCM Project (HELCAP) will be established as Project 2731 to specifically differentiate HELCAP efforts from other efforts in the Directed Energy R-2 Activity under Project 3400.


The FY 2020 Appropriation Act directed ONR to establish appropriate projects for prototyping efforts to provide additional acquisition oversight, fiscal clarity and adherence to financial management practices.  Within this PE, INP funding was moved from Proj 3400 Innovative Naval Protoypes (INP) Adv Tech Dev to new stand-alone projects as indicated below starting in FY 2021.

- Proj 3416: HIJENKS
- Proj 3423: LOCUST
- Proj 3450: AMOS
- Proj 3451: CLAWS
- Proj 3452: ELEKTRA    
- Proj 3453: Hypersonic Booster 
- Proj 3454: MDUSV    
- Proj 3455: MINERVA

- Proj 3459: Super Swarm (SS)</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) portfolio includes efforts that solve problems and respond to mission requirements, as well as, exploratory research for new ideas and breakthrough capabilities. Larger in scope, scale and risk Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) are selected for their high-payoff and potential to revolutionize operational concepts. The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) continue the Applied Research work in PE 0602792N for promising INPs with Advanced Technology Development activities. INP investments define the future of U.S. naval forces. Due to high technical risk, INPs often have long trial-and-error timeframes to work through challenges, but typically no more than three years between decision points. INP efforts mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require applied and advanced technology development funding to bridge from concept to working prototype. INPs prove technological and capability potential, validate production feasibility, and acquisition potential. ONR demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to a new acquisition programs. INPs are selected by senior leadership in the Department of the Navy. 

This Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).


Because to the nature of these projects described, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns. Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM) plans and associated resources are realigned from Project 3400 in Program Element (PE) 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) Adv Tech Dev into this new Project 2480 within PE 0603801N effective FY 2020.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM) is a multi-year effort in various stages of research and development within the Navy's Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. SSL-TM will develop a maritime laser weapons system prototype and test it on a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant, and conduct the required laser weapon system engineering, design, integration and testing necessary to have a testable, experimental prototype. This system will be capable of supporting missions such as defense against small boat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) disruption and defeat. The project will conduct at-sea testing on the full laser weapon system demonstrator (i.e., prototype) from a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant. 

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>High Energy Laser Counter ASCM Project (HELCAP) plans and associated resources are realigned from Project 3400 in Program Element (PE) 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Adv Tec Dev into this new Project 2731 within PE 0603801N effective FY 2021. This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High Energy Laser Counter ASCM Project (HELCAP): Defeating Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCMs) with a laser weapon system presents several technical challenges. The High Energy Laser Counter ASCM Project HELCAP will assess, develop, experiment, and demonstrate the various laser weapon system technologies and methods of implementation required to defeat ASCMs.

HELCAP will leverage the knowledge gained in the Navy Laser Family of Systems (NLFoS) efforts that include:
- Alternative Laser Sources for higher powers, also known as the Ruggedized High Energy Laser (RHEL) activities;
- Solid State Laser Tech Maturation activities that provides initial key enabling technical solutions in high power lasers and beam control, and will provide opportunities for single ship operational and sustainment learning;
- Surface Navy Laser Weapon System Increment 1 (SNLWS Inc. 1) project that provides the initial combat system integration and installation knowledge for Aegis platforms, and multi-ship battle force operations knowledge;
- Optical Dazzling Interdictor Navy (ODIN) that provides Counter-ISR technical and fleet operational knowledge.
This leveraged knowledge and new HELCAP technical solutions to the C-ASCM problem will enable a fully informed decision to rapidly field an integrated, fleet ready, HEL Weapon.

HELCAP activities being conducted in this project include technology assessments, laser lethality investigations, and advanced beam control. This project passes technology to follow on HELCAP activities being conducted under Program Element (PE) 0603925N Directed Energy and Electric Weapon Systems.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Information security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project contains all Advanced Technology Development Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) investments that are developing new technologies for cyber warfare. Potential adversaries are investing in advanced technologies that will challenge our advantages in the critical information domain. Nation states and non-state actors seek to degrade our command and control capabilities, networks and computer systems. Cyber threats continue to grow and rapidly proliferate. Technologies developed in this Project will enable the warfighter to take immediate, appropriate action at any time against any desired adversary, target or network by assuring that autonomous, continuous analyses of intelligence, persistent surveillance and open information sources have, at all times, optimized the possible courses of action based on commander's guidance. Technologies within this activity will foster operational endurance and enable sustained operations and resiliency for warfighters and platforms through enhanced cyber security/protection.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Information security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020, three new stand alone project units were created for three INP major focus areas to better consolidate and coordinate the acceleration of these efforts. The three project units are: 2480 Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM), 2481 the Electro-Magnetic Railgun, and 2958 Cyberspace Activities. These projects were moved from Project Unit 3400.

The FY 2020 Appropriation Act directed ONR to establish appropriate projects for prototyping efforts to provide additional acquisition oversight, fiscal clarity and adherence to financial management practices.  Within this PE, INP funding was moved from Proj 3400 Innovative Naval Protoypes (INP) Adv Tech Dev to new stand-alone projects as indicated below starting in FY 2021.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Project address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program. These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. INP investments do not necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases, but they do have the goal of moving into the acquisition process within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. They mature technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. As such, INPs require both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding. The BA2 INP funds are specified in a separate Program Element (PE), 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

The electromagnetic spectrum is a key operational maneuver space enabled by continuous, real-time awareness of all spectrum activity. This R-2 Activity supports spectrum dominance which included efforts that focus on communications, surveillance, Electronic Warfare (EW) and electronics to understand and shape the battle space. The ability to assure access to the full spectrum is essential for battle space awareness and threat surveillance/weapon sensor engagement. Technologies within this activity will provide for integrated and distributed forces capable of dynamic synchronized actions through interoperable forces by incorporation of autonomous/disaggregated systems to increase flexibility and reach within the electromagnetic spectrum.</r2:Description>

This Arctic Mobile Observing System (AMOS) will operate via a sea ice-based buoy that enables the critical infrastructure necessary to support persistent sensing at a lower cost and with less risk than deploying manned platforms in the Arctic. Activities include buoy node construction and testing, software development, vehicle acquisition, and Arctic-hardening of sensors and platforms. The project includes domain-specific engineering development, upgrading UUV platform designs for the Arctic environment, developing the power and communication buoy node for the Arctic domain, incorporating mature and maturing UUV sensing capabilities into vehicles and ensure suitability for Arctic operations. The project will also develop under-ice CONOPS for the autonomous UUV network, building on capabilities developed under previous efforts for vehicle autonomy, re-charging, sensing, communication, and Command, Control, Communication &amp; Computers (C4I), and develop new capabilities for operating under sea ice. A key thrust will be to enable an under-ice acoustic navigation system for unmanned platforms, suitable for use in any GPS-denied operational area.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>HIgh-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS) plans and associated resources are realigned from Project Unit 3400 in Program Element (PE) 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) Adv Tec Dev into this new Project Unit 3416 effective FY 2021. This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The HIgh-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS) INP effort is a non-kinetic High Power Microwave (HPM) payload integrated on an airborne platform will enable the prosecution of multiple targets with area coverage across each target and open targets previously restricted due to collateral damage. HIJENKS increases operational access by disrupting land-based infrastructure facilities tied to adversary systems, decreases cost exchange ratios through non-kinetic engagement, and addresses targets previously restricted due to collateral damage concerns/moral hardening. It expands the competitive space in the electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt, degrade, and destroy critical electronic targets. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3416 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the HIJENKS INP effort.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Information security concerns preclude fully detailed descriptions of project efforts, research activities, and technology development plans. Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Adversary military modernization and increasing contested domains require a shift in approach "...to strike diverse targets inside adversary air and missile defense networks to destroy mobile power-projection platforms. This will include capabilities to enhance close combat lethality in complex terrain." LOCUST will develop and deliver autonomy, C2 architecture, and a series of modular payloads on a robust, scalable, flexible, multifunctional UAV system; employable from surface, sub-surface, airborne, and ground manned and un-manned systems to provide a dispersed, resilient, and adaptive capability to gain a competitive military advantage.  LOCUST will provide ISR and precision loitering munitions capable of being launched from air, surface, ground, and sub-surface platforms to conduct both singular and swarm operations across battlespace in conjunction with Joint and manned operations. It will demonstrate multi-domain launch and strike operations, heterogeneous air platform payloads, unmanned from unmanned operations, distributed control of the strike mission, and refined cost elements for critical technologies that have supply chain assurance addressed. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3423 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the LOCUST INP effort.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

The "swarm architecture facing" portion of each of these payloads is a significant departure from traditional payload development and will also be investigated through evaluations of ability of payloads to request or drive a behavior from the swarm in addition to more traditional payload utilization approaches. Integration onto a range of platforms will be considered and appropriate design and certifications will be addressed.</r2:Text>

CLAWS will demonstrate autonomous missions in denied waters, develop and demonstrate autonomous technologies for survivability of large UUVs, and develop autonomy and launch capabilities for special mission payloads.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy currently lacks the ability to demonstrate a ship-launched, DARPA-developed HAWC Cruiser as the original USAF-RAAF air-launch effort did not address naval capabilities. Hypersonic Booster will develop a CVN-capable HAWC AUR for air-launched flight demonstration that will require a 25% reduction in overall length to enable fitment in CVN weapons elevators). The goal from the outset will be to leverage DARPA-developed HAWC program for naval applications. It will flight test a CVN compliant, Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) All-Up-Round (AUR) to demonstrate airframe and booster propulsion technologies. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3453 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the Hypersonic Booster INP effort.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The need to operate in a multiple domain environment against highly capable peers requires improved decision quality and reduced decision timelines. MINERVA will develop AI and Machine-Learning (ML) capabilities to improve mission planning, intelligence gathering, execution and assessment.

The Activity identified in Project Unit 3455 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the MINERVA INP effort.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Long Range Targeting emphasizes the specific naval use of AI in an integrated system that addresses a warfighting challenge. This project contains coordinated investments in Applied Research that contribute to the Long Range Targeting (LRT) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP). This Advanced Technology Development, in coordination with a complimentary Applied Research investment in Program Element (PE) 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res, will create an overall capability for LRT. Technologies within this activity will enable integrated and distributed forces capable of dynamic synchronized actions. Investments include technologies for sense and sense making and Artificial Intelligence for predictive mission-focused analytics that autonomously gather, analyze, compile, interpret, and visualize a fused tactical and national all source data picture to improve planning and decision making speeds. Investments will also establish a distributed Artificial Intelligence capability that can function in a harsh and adversarial environment, determine an optimal response and react in real-time. The Activity identified in Project Unit 3457 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the LRT INP effort.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential.

                                <r2:Description>Long Range Targeting emphasizes the specific naval use of AI in an integrated system that addresses a warfighting challenge. This project contains coordinated investments in Applied Research that contribute to the Long Range Targeting (LRT) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP). This Advanced Technology Development, in coordination with a complimentary Applied Research investment in Program Element (PE) 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Res, will create an overall capability for LRT. Technologies within this activity will enable integrated and distributed forces capable of dynamic synchronized actions. Investments include technologies for sense and sense making and Artificial Intelligence for predictive mission-focused analytics that autonomously gather, analyze, compile, interpret, and visualize a fused tactical and national all source data picture to improve planning and decision making speeds. Investments will also establish a distributed Artificial Intelligence capability that can function in a harsh and adversarial environment, determine an optimal response and react in real-time.</r2:Description>

This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Undersea Warfare Efforts Project will develop new technology for offensive and defensive warfare conducted on the seabed, in the sea (i.e. subsea), and from the sea. Undersea Warfare Efforts will address three thrusts identified in the Undersea Warfare Development Command's document, "Full Spectrum Undersea Warfare Concept of Operations (CONOPS)". These thrusts are: advanced offensive missions for submarines, subsea and seabed warfare, and distributed undersea warfare. Distributed undersea warfare technology will enable full participation of all undersea warfare assets in the Navy's Distributed Maritime Operations concept. Undersea Warfare missions this Project addresses include Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Anti Surface Warfare, Strike, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Mine Warfare, and Subsea and Seabed Warfare (SSW). The Activity identified in Project Unit 3458 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the Undersea Warfare INP effort.

INP investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature, as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. Due to high technical risk, INPs typically have long duration but have no more than three years between decision points. INPs do not develop hardware for service use, rather they prove technological and production feasibility, and show naval utility and acquisition potential. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) demonstrates INPs in relevant environments. Successful experimentation and demonstrations present the Department of the Navy with disruptive capabilities that may lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and acquisition programs. The Department of the Navy would have to make significant acquisition decisions to integrate the new technological capabilities into naval warfighting systems. INPs are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

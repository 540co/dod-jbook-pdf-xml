            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) programs were selected as a candidate for the BA8 Software RDT&amp;E Appropriation Pilot Program in FY 2021. These efforts are a continuation and transfer from RDTE PE 0605041A EV5, OPA PE 0128B63000, and OMA SAG 151251. Cyber Situational Understanding (SU), DCO Development Environment (DCODE) (formerly Forge), and non-software Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) Rapid Cyber Prototyping are not part of the Software Pilot and remain within RDTE PE 0605041A. In addition, Garrison Defensive Platforms (GDP) and Deployable DCO Systems (DDS) remain within OPA PE 0128B63000.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) Key Enabler for Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy. The DCO budget line includes funding for Program Executive Office Command Control and Communications - Tactical (PEO C3T) Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI); Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) Defensive Cyber Operations; and Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) Rapid Cyber Prototyping.

Platforms/Levels:
* DCO - Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI) - (PEO C3T) - Tactical/Command Post Level
* DCO - Cyberspace Analytics - (PEO EIS) - (Gabriel Nimbus) - Strategic Level (Army Cyberspace Operations and Integration Center (ACOIC))

Defensive Cyber Tools and Analytics:
* DCO - Cyberspace Analytics - (PEO EIS) - Strategic Level (ACOIC)
* DCO - Mission Planning - (PEO EIS) - Strategic Level
* DCO - Tools Suite - (PEO EIS) - Garrison/Tactical Level
* DCO - User Activity Monitoring - (PEO EIS) - Strategic Level
* DCO - Forensics and Malware Analysis - (PEO EIS) - Garrison/Tactical Level
* DCO - Threat Emulation - (PEO EIS) - Strategic Level (Training)

- Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI) is a software-only program, which consists of pre-configured DCO tools residing on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI). The TDI capability will reside within the Command Post at echelon Corps through Brigade for both organic Cyber Network Defenders as well as remote access by Cyber Protection teams (CPT) to support defense of the Tactical Network. 

- Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) consists of platform and software programs which are key elements of the DCO Maneuver Baseline infrastructure, platform, and tools. The employment of defensive capabilities creates specific effects in cyberspace through actions that allow commanders to achieve the following objectives: deter, destroy, and defeat enemy offensive cyberspace operations; gain time; economy of force; control key terrain; protect tasked critical assets and infrastructure; and develop intelligence. DCO supports the Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER), ACOIC, (5) Regional Cyber Centers (RCCs), Cyber Warfare Battalion (CWB), Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF), Cyber Protection Brigade (CPB), and (41) Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) in COMPO 1/2/3.

- ARCYBER Rapid Cyber Prototyping provides software based capabilities that can quickly respond to emerging cyber threats and keep up with threat technology. ARCYBER identifies potential development and prototyping efforts via Cyber Needs Forms (CNFs) based on operational feedback, changes in tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs), and trends of adversarial activity. These are separate and distinct from DCO programs identified and are used to rapidly address a network threat/vulnerability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCO Information System Capabilities Development Document (IS ICD) was approved on 19 Dec 17 by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC). DCO programs are under an IT Box construct with five year term (FY18-22) which aligns with current Requirements Definition Package (RDP).

The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), approved the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 13 Apr 18, designating Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI) as an ACAT III program. The TDI program's RDP was approved on 8 Nov 18 by the Army Requirement Board (ARB). Under subsequent reviews, the MDA approved a tailored defense unique software intensive acquisition approach for TDI. To support this agile acquisition approach, the TDI program office will develop and deploy pre-configured software in a series of capability drops in order to deliver full functional values of the RDP that align with DCO priorities. The TDI program had a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) of TDI's initial capability approved by the MDA on Sep 19, which allowed the program to achieve IOC Oct 19. TDI is hosted on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and will be fielded by the CPCE/TSI program in accordance with their fielding schedule. Execution of the TDI program will be a combination of government entities and commercial vendors.

The ARB approved Cyber Analytics and DCO Tool Suite RDPs on 24 Apr 18; Mission Planning on 26 Jun 18; and User Activity Monitoring and Forensics and Malware on 16 Oct 18. The MDA designated these as ACAT IV programs. Under subsequent reviews, the MDA approved agile acquisition approach to develop and deliver pre-configured software in a series of releases and capability drops in order to deliver full functional values of the RDP that align with DCO priorities. DCO programs utilize standard and 874 agile pilot evolutionary acquisition processes (30-90 rapid acquisition approach). DCO continually delivers new technologies and capabilities as a prototype and fields updated capabilities. DCO contract strategy utilizes multiple existing contracts vehicles to include Other Transactional Authority (OTA), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)-based, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), and Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ScheduleDetailNote>TDI full deployment is defined when programs have completed the development and testing of the last capability drop within the IT Box (reaching full functional values of the RDP) and has transferred the capability to the CPCE/TSI program to commence fielding.

DCO is capability owner and full operational capability is defined when programs have completed the development and testing of the last capability drop within the IT Box (reaching full functional values of the RDP).

Current DCO IT box ends in FY22. Army Capabilities Manager (ACM, formerly TRADOC Capability Manager (TCM)) is working a new DCO IS ICD to align with a new IT Box construct for FY23-27.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

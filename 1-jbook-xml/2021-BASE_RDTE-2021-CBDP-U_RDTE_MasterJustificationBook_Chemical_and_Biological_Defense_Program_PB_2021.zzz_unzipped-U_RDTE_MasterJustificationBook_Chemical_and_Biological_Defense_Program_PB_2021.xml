                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The projects in this program element (PE) support applied research in the areas of physical technologies, non-traditional agent (NTA) medical and physical defense technologies, and medical technologies.  Major efforts support development of vaccines, therapeutics, next generation diagnostics systems, next generation chemical detectors, nerve agent pretreatments, and individual protection advances.

Individual projects include:
- Chemical Biological Defense (CB2): continual improvements in CB physical sciences defense materiel, including contamination avoidance, decontamination, detection and protection technologies, as well as biological weapon/agent surveillance (e.g. CB protective materials, textiles, and filtration, sensors and sensing algorithms, effects modeling, chemical formulations, processes, and methods for hazard mitigation).

- Non-Traditional Agents (NTA) Defense (NT2): supports all NTA efforts (both medical and non-medical) including pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, threat agent science, modeling, protection and hazard mitigation and characterization of emerging threats.  Starting in FY21, an administrative change pertaining to efforts of improving S&amp;T budget agility and transition efficiency was applied by merging NTA lines to RDT&amp;E Projects CB2, Chemical Biological Defense and TM2, Techbase Medical Defense.

- Techbase Medical Defense (TM2): development of antidotes, drug treatments, disease surveillance and point-of-need diagnostic devices, patient decontamination and medical technologies management (e.g. drug discovery and platform technology development, biomarkers and assay development useful in drug development and diagnostics, human mimicking devices and regulatory science).

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project NT2 provides early applied research to enhance and develop defensive capabilities against Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs). This project focuses on expanding scientific knowledge required to develop defensive capabilities and to demonstrate fast and agile scientific responses to enhance or develop capabilities that address emerging threats.  Efforts and studies conducted under this project address direction from the FDA to conduct specific post-New Drug Application (NDA)-approval efforts and studies (e.g. required studies, Post Marketing Commitments), and requirements from the joint service users. This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing Non-Traditional Agents (NTA) defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.

Individual efforts in this project include:
- Support an integrated approach to counter emerging threats through innovative science and technology (S&amp;T) solutions for detection, protection, decontamination, information systems and modeling and simulation, and medical countermeasures. 
- Provides for the upgrade and modernization of Medical Chemical  Defense countermeasures which include U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prophylactics, pre-treatments, and therapeutics and intend to protect and/or sustain the Joint Service Member in a toxic chemical threat environment.

Starting in FY21, an administrative change improving S&amp;T budget agility and transition efficiency will merge NTA lines to RDT&amp;E Projects Chemical Biological Defense (CB2) and Techbase Medical Defense (TM2).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort involves the development of neuroprotectants, anticonvulsants, improved therapies for enzyme reactivation, and investigation of alternate pathways leading to treatment. This effort also includes discovery and development of therapeutic strategies to treat dermal, ocular and respiratory injuries of CWAs. Efforts in this area are designed to develop potential candidates that will ultimately be submitted for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure or to identify previously licensed products for new uses in the treatment of chemical warfare casualties.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The projects in this program element (PE) demonstrate technologies supporting transition to advanced component development for physical capabilities which cover biological and chemical detection, situational awareness and effects modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Other major efforts support enhanced chemical detection capabilities for aerosols and non-traditional agents, expanded capabilities for early warning in pathogen detection and diagnosis, and pretreatments and therapeutics against a broader set of chemical and biological agents.  Medical capabilities (pretreatments, therapeutics, diagnostics capabilities, and drug manufacturing and regulatory science technologies), include capabilities against non-traditional agents.

Individual projects include:
- Chemical Biological Defense (CB3): demonstrations of CB physical science defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, digital battlespace management, and protection, and decontamination. This project continues to pursue solutions against traditional agents.

- Non-Traditional Agents (NTA) Defense (NT3): supports all efforts (both medical and non-medical) including chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Starting in FY21, an administrative change pertaining to efforts of improving S&amp;T budget agility and transition efficiency was applied by merging a portion of the NTA lines to RDT&amp;E Projects CB3, Chemical Biological Defense and TM3, Techbase Medical Defense.

- Techbase Medical Defense (TM3): aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents. Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.

- Technology Transition (TT3): pursues federal R&amp;D or commercially available products to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.

The CBDP S&amp;T Advanced Technology Development stakeholders: The U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center (CCDC CBC), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), United States Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, Naval Research Lab (NRL), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), among others. The intent is to maintain strategic partnerships with the DoD Service communities for mission success across the enterprise through collaborative planning and programming maintaining budget assurance.

Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (PE 0603884BP) and System Development and Demonstration (PE 0604384BP) activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project focuses on demonstrating fast and agile scientific responses to enhance or develop capabilities that address emerging threats.  This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing NTA defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.  This project supports advanced technology development of NTA defense science and technology initiatives and transitioning to advance development.  

Individual efforts in this project include:
- Support an integrated approach to develop new or enhanced countermeasures against novel and emerging threats through innovative science and technology (S&amp;T) solutions for detection, protection, decontamination and medical countermeasures (MCMs).  
- Efforts supply test methodologies and supporting science to verify capabilities, develop protection and hazard mitigation options, expand hazard assessment tools, and develop MCMs against NTAs.  

Starting in FY21, an administrative change improving S&amp;T budget agility and transition efficiency will merge a portion of the NTA lines to RDT&amp;E Projects Chemical Biological Defense (CB3) and Techbase Medical Defense (TM3).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

A portion of Project NT3, Techbase Non-Traditional Agents Defense, will merge into this Project starting in FY21.

Individual efforts in this project include: 
- Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  
- In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.
- Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense includes chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project addresses the three primary chemical and biological defense thrust areas of Assess, Protect, and Mitigate with an emphasis on Integrated Early Warning (IEW) and Integrated Layered Defense (ILD).  IEW is conducted through a coordinated program approach focused on layering chemical and biological detection technologies and integrating CB threat indicators, providing a combination of awareness and understanding that facilitates effective decision making so the force can continue military operations and achieve mission success in a CBRN environment.  The ILD achieves solutions for capability gaps across medical and non-medical commodity areas to enable warfighter survival and rapid recovery in a CBRN environment.

Individual efforts in this project include:
-	Programs that offer the opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies, reduce risks, and finalize engineering and integration efforts.
-	Programs that seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness. Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated. Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can remain in place for future extended user evaluations, accepted into the advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full- scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The projects in this program element (PE) support technology, engineering, integration, and life-cycle cost risk reduction activities (e.g. component development, prototyping, and experimentation) prior to Milestone B.  

Individual projects include:
- Contamination Avoidance (CA4): development of reconnaissance, detection, identification, and hazard prediction equipment, hardware, and software that minimize Chemical, Biological, Radiological (CBR) contamination and prevent further cross-contamination during operations.

- Decontamination (DE4): development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.

- Individual Protection (IP4): development of the next generation protective ensembles (e.g., suits, boots, and gloves) which enable the Joint Force to survive and continue the mission in CBR contaminated environments.  

- Information Systems (IS4): component development and prototyping of information architectures and applications for shaping the battlespace and providing integrated early warning against Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) threats.

- Medical Biological Defense (MB4): development of medical countermeasure platform technologies, medical countermeasures (vaccines and therapeutics), reagents, assays, and diagnostic equipment to provide an effective capability for medical defense against biological warfare agent threats facing U.S. Forces in the field.

- Medical Chemical Defense (MC4): development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items (e.g., diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds) necessary to provide an effective capability for medical defense against chemical warfare agent threats facing U.S. Forces in the field.  

- Test and Evaluation (TE4): critical test capabilities, planning, and infrastructure improvements/modifications necessary to evaluate CBRN Defense systems in realistic operating environments.

- Techbase Medical Defense (TM4): reduces risk and establishes safety and tolerability for vaccines prior to transition to System Development &amp; Demonstration.  

- Technology Transition (TT4): validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies and their respective concepts-of-operations for significant improvement to Warfighter capabilities in preparation for transition of mature technologies to advanced development programs requiring chemical and biological (CB) defense technologies.  This effort facilitates transitions of Integrated Early Warning and Integrated Layered Defense products.  

The projects in this PE support the advanced component technology development phase of the DoD acquisition system and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Contamination Avoidance Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports reconnaissance, detection, identification, and hazard prediction equipment, hardware, and software.  

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Compact Chemical Vapor Agent Detector- CVCAD (formerly Wearable Chemical Agent Detector- WCAD)
(2) Biosurveillance (BSV)
(3) Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Sensor Integration on Robotics Platforms (CSIRP)
(4) Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets (CBRN DRS)
(5) Enhanced Capability Demonstration Integrated Early Warning (ECD IEW)
(6) Enhanced Capability Demonstration Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (ECD JCACS)
(7) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense, and
(8) Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA).

The CVCAD formerly known as WCAD is designed to be an unobtrusive, low-profile chemical detection capability that will continuously, and autonomously, monitor and alert general and specialized units to an unsafe environment without further burdening the warfighters payload or interfering with the primary mission. The small form factor is amenable to both man-worn and unmanned aerial or unmanned ground systems operations in order to enable timely personnel protective action and other force protection decisions.  

BSV efforts provide a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics.  BSV will address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over eleven requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV supports the Capabilities to Enable NBC Threat Awareness, Understanding, and Response (CENTAUR) effort, and immediate operational needs, which find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering CB threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a CB Event. CENTAUR serves as the baseline configuration for ECD IEW which will be renamed CBRN IEW and merged to RDT&amp;E Project IS4, Information Systems in FY21.

CSIRP is a prototyping and fielding effort that will focus on repackaging and integrating modular CBRN sensor solutions to enhance Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) and Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) Programs of Record (PORs) to provide situational awareness across the echelons of command in order to enable freedom of maneuver and action on the battlefield.  An integrated CSIRP capability will exploit advances in machine learning and autonomy, sensing and communication capabilities that enable timely and accurate detection, warning and reporting of CBRN hazards for increased risk reduction opportunities at tactical and operational echelons in mounted and dismounted configurations.  CSIRP gives the Joint Force an opportunity to enhance capabilities and maintain operational advantage in a lethal and sophisticated operating environment.  

The CBRN DRS supports Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Sensitive Site Assessment missions which enables more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow for the Warfighter. The CBRN DRS will provide an Advanced Capabilities Set to meet emerging requirements for the follow-on technical forces to conduct more in-depth dismounted CBRN reconnaissance, sensitive site assessment, characterization of WMD/hazardous materials, events, or accidents, and sensitive site exploitation/elimination. The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Advanced Capability Set will provide more sensitive and reliable detection and identification of CBRN threats, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) for longer duration missions, and increased situation awareness through networked communications of the hazard. The CBRN DRS configurations will be tailored to meet individual Service mission tasks.  The technology upgrade and refresh effort for CBRN DRS transitions from CA4 to CA7 for implementation starting in FY20.

The ECD IEW will integrate advanced technologies and currently fielded capabilities into a common architecture with situational understanding decision tools to facilitate effective (timely) decision making, so the force can continue military operations or assist partners or civilians in a Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) environment.  The Joint Force requires tactical, enhanced, and CBRN detection, protection, contamination mitigation, contamination characterization, situational awareness, and hazard understanding early warning capability and decision tools to provide operational commanders time, space, and confidence for decisions that enable mission success.  ECD IEW will demonstrate these capabilities by focusing on the complex integration of currently disconnected and disparate battlefield systems to enable a Joint Integrated Early Warning Capability for all phases of operations.

The ECD JCACS demonstrated new technologies to enhance the ability of Joint operators to locate, identify, characterize, sample, digitally report, protect against, and mitigate CBRN threats.  The ECD JCACS will integrate advanced technologies to provide capability sets of equipment and situational awareness tools to protect against and mitigate the effects of contamination during WMD interdiction and site characterization missions.  In FY20, ECD JCACS will focus on the use of robotics to enhance these missions.  FY20 is the last year of funding and the ECD JCACS robotics efforts will transition over to CSIRP in FY21.

NTA Defense program works with the Joint Services, interagency, and international partners to focus RDT&amp;E resources to determine readiness against Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBA) and other emerging threats.  Program provides support to the CBDP Enterprise by assessing technology and equipment to enable rapid fielding options for all users.

The ROSETTA is a modernization effort to provide a higher confidence chemical liquid hazard detection ticket in the currently fielded M256A2 kit for the Warfighter to make timely decisions.  These decisions will reduce casualties and improve the combat effectiveness of troops engaged in conflicts involving the use of chemical warfare agents. ROSETTA is based on colorimetric technology and will be eye-readable.  In addition, the ROSETTA ticket will provide improved hazard detection performance with reduced false alarm rate, potential for increased number of chemicals detected, reduced detection time especially for certain compounds of interest, and potential for integration onto unmanned platforms especially micro-sized unmanned aerial sensors.  In FY20, ROSETTA will be testing vendor prototypes to develop technical data packages using BA5 funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>WEARABLE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (WCAD)

WCAD will complete Technology Readiness Evaluation, Modeling &amp; Simulation, Table Top Exercises, and initiate Business Case Analysis efforts to support contractual development for a Milestone A award when program funding restarts. WCAD will continue engagement with Other Government Agency (OGA) stakeholders and industry to inform documentation decisions and program decisions.  WCAD was unfunded in FY20, but will restart in FY21 with the new name Compact Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (CVCAD).

COMPACT VAPOR CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (CVCAD)

CVCAD will begin to execute the Other Transactional Agreements (OTA) contracts in FY21 (when funding is first aligned), that were initiated by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in FY20, to evaluate systems against Warfighter requirements. CVCAD will work closely with the CBRN Sensors Integrated onto Robotic Platforms (CSIRP) in order to transition a lightweight chemical detection capability to CSIRP for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration. Prior to FY21 the effort was called Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD); CVCAD will build on the work done under the WCAD.

BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV will utilize residual capabilities from Capabilities to Enable NBC Threat Awareness, Understanding, and Response (CENTAUR). With the Close out of CENTAUR , BSV will transition and integrate successful technologies into a baseline Integrated Early Warning (IEW) framework, to support United States Forces Korea (USFK) &amp; 8th Army's need for environmental monitoring and surveillance, in support of immediate force health protection requirements. Applicable technologies, will be developed, integrated, deployed, operated and sustained, through Other Transaction Agreements (OTA) and procurement contracts. Completion of the effort will serve as a baseline configuration for IEW efforts with in the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP), technologies, lessons learned, test data, will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) IEW, Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD), Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) &amp; Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS)). BSV transitions to CBRN IEW in FY21.

CBRN SENSOR INTEGRATION ON ROBOTIC PLATFORMS (CSIRP)

CSIRP is a streamlined acquisition effort to rapidly prototype and field capabilities distinct from the traditional acquisition system.  CSIRP will provide unmanned CBRN payload prototypes in 2 year prototyping plan cycles based on service requirements.   The prototyping plans will utilize a streamlined acquisition process in order to keep pace with industry and the rapid advancement of technologies.  The CSIRP strategy is to utilize the rapid prototyping process enabled by the Other Transactional Agreements (OTA) contract vehicle.  Upon award, the awardees will have up to two years to produce prototype CBRN sensors that are integrated onto service chosen (air and/or ground) platforms.  These prototypes will be demonstrated, evaluated and tested by the services as well as laboratories and academia.  The most successful will be transitioned to the services for the next steps in acquisition, production and eventual fielding across the services.  BA4 funding will provide market research to support the refinement and the building of technologically mature prototypes.  BA5 funding will provide demonstrations, testing and operational assessments to support transition decisions to POR or sustained capability of the prototypes.

CBRN DISMOUNTED RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEMS

The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) will provide more sensitive and reliable detection and identification of CBRN threats, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) for longer duration missions, and increased situation awareness through networked communications of the hazard. The program will assess requirements and the market for future technology upgrades and refresh efforts to be transferred to and executed under CA7.


ENHANCED CAPABILITY DEMO INTEGRATED EARLY WARNING (ECD IEW)

The Enhanced Capability Demonstration Integrated Early Warning (ECD IEW) will conduct an analysis of alternatives and leverage the IEW Advanced Capability Demonstration (ATD), and various operational responses to procure developmental equipment and decision support tools for experimentation and demonstration to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS TTPs, Non-CBRN sensors, and requirements to provide operational commanders time and space for freedom to maneuver and action.  The ECD IEW will utilize Table Top Exercises (TTX), Operational Demonstrations, and other test events to provide cross commodity equipment sets evaluation leading to the operational deployment through rapid prototyping to a unit to be determined, further requirements development, CBDP program of record insertion, and concepts of employment. ECD IEW transitions to CBRN IEW in FY21.

ENHANCED CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATION JOINT CBRNE ADV CAPABILITY SETS (ECD JCACS)

The Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (JCACS) evaluates various equipment during User Feedback Events (UFE) and other test events.  The acquisition strategy is to use Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs) and collaborate with CBRN Sensor Integration onto Robotic Platforms (CSIRP) to acquire the equipment and technical support required.  Additionally, JCACS and CSIRP will utilize Government Agencies and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers to provide development, testing and technical support.  ECD JCACS will focus on the use and integration of robotics to enhance these missions.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The NTA Defense program will transition information, technologies, and capabilities associated with Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBAs) and other emerging threats into existing and future acquisition programs utilizing a variety of contract mechanisms.

REACTIVE CHEMISTRY ORTHOGONAL SURFACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TICKET ARRAY (ROSETTA)

ROSETTA will use a streamlined approach. This approach is based on technology that will transition from Science and Technology Efforts and industry.  It will be developed using the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) OTA to award multiple development contracts. The M256A3 Production Contract will use Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) to purchase the new kits. The ROSETTA funding will complete the development and testing of the new ROSETTA ticket as well as update the currently fielded M256A2 technical data package via an engineering change proposal (ECP) to create a new M256A3 kit that will be available to all Services. The M256A3 kit will replace the M256A2 kit by attrition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations. These efforts align with the National Defense Strategy by prioritizing preparedness for war and sustaining Joint Force military advantage and resilient force posture. 

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) CBRN Covers, Coatings and Protective Overlays (C3PO)
(2) Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS)
(3) Mass Personnel Decontamination (MPD)
(4) Service Equipment Decontamination System (SEDS)
(5) Tactical Disablement System (TacDS)

The CBRN Covers, Coatings and Protective Overlays (C3PO) program is a FY21 new start with a Family of Systems approach that will provide contamination mitigation capability to critical equipment and assets prior to a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) attack to mitigate the effects and amount of CBRN contamination exposure allowing the Joint Force to be better prepared for war, maintain a resilient force posture, and remain lethal.  These capabilities include but are not limited to CBRN protective covers, coatings, paints, and other preventative measures.  The program will address capability gaps identified in the ConMit Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), date 11 March 2011 modernizing a key capability. 
  
The Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS) program will provide a Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) packaging solution to safely return chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains to the Continental United States.  The CHRT is a containment system that will protect personnel from the hazards associated with transporting human remains that are potentially contaminated, without posing additional risk to the handlers or the environment in accordance with federal and international transportation standards.  The CHRS program addresses a capability gap identified within the ConMit Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), dated March 2011, for a CHRT packaging solution to safely return chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains to the Continental United States.

The Mass Personnel Decontamination (MPD) program will provide Warfighters with the capability to reduce the hazards associated with mass casualty decontamination efforts for protected and unprotected personnel, causalities and contaminated human remains potentially exposed to CBRN hazards. The program will develop an array of rugged and reliable best-of-breed hardware in a manageably sized, easy to erect, modular system that can be quickly tailored to different Mass Casualty events in order to support decontamination of ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients, and allow for the processing of contaminated human remains. This reduces and limits the spread of contamination among potentially contaminated population groups through a standardized, modular system scalable to increase capability, aligning with the National Defense Strategy by prioritizing preparedness for war in order to remain lethal. The MPD program addresses capability gaps identified within the Consequence Management ICD, dated 14 October 2010, the ConMit ICD, dated 1 March 2011, and the Mortuary Affairs Operations ICD, dated October 2008.  

The Service Equipment Decontamination System (SEDS) program is a FY21 new start program that will develop reliable and modular hardware intended to decontaminate military equipment including vehicles, aircraft, personal effects, and weapons to pre-contamination conditions, which sustains Joint Force military advantages and a resilient force posture, building a more lethal Force that aligns with the National Defense Strategy. SEDS will provide contamination mitigation capabilities for hardened, sensitive and/or critical equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical and biological contamination.  The program will address capability gaps identified in the ConMit ICD, date 11 March 2011.

The Tactical Disablement System (TacDS), is a family of systems (FoS) that will provide tactical commanders a suite of products to disable (delay, disrupt, and/or degrade) or defeat (destroy) small quantities of chemical or biological materials of concern (C/BMOC) contained in munitions and bulk containers.  The TacDS will operate in locations both remote and accessible, during hostile and non-hostile conditions, and within established time periods, to reduce or eliminate the employability of C/BMOC against the Joint Force and/or prevent state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction, a defense objective in the National Defense Strategy.  TacDS addresses capability gaps identified in the ICD for WMD-Defeat (August 2010), ICD for WMD Elimination Analytic Report (March 2013), WMD Disablement ICD (July 2017), and the Sponsor-approved Draft CDD for TacDS FoS (March 2018). The TacDS suite of capabilities will provide a new warfighter capability at the tactical level and play a critical role in DoD's ability to respond effectively to WMD crises and C/BMOC. Two products are currently under development; Product #1, Thermite Bag, a man-portable destruction capability, and Product #2, Epoxy Kit, a delay capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The C3PO acquisition approach involves the use of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Authority (CWMD OTA), Competitive/Firm Fixed Price (C/FFP) contract,  to design and develop state of the art equipment using competitive and iterative prototyping. The C3PO program will evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf options to reduce development costs. The program will test prototypes against live chemical warfare agents and biological warfare agents, conduct reliability, availability, and maintainability testing, conduct regular user evaluations to identify human system integration issues, and will conduct testing to ensure the system meets military standards.

CONTAMINATED HUMAN REMAINS SYSTEM (CHRS)

The CHRS program will leverage previous efforts under a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) which have accelerated the CHRT project.  Additional minor design modifications, developmental and operational testing is part of the overall acquisition strategy.  Product development consists of the design and prototyping of a CHRT.  The contracting strategy will use the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Agreement (CWMD OTA) to procure prototype units, followed by Developmental Testing (DT).  Following DT completion, an In-Process Review will be conducted. A Logistics Demonstration (LD) and Operational Testing (OT) will be conducted.  An Operational Test Agency (OTA) Evaluation Report (OER) will be written, and technical reviews will be conducted, in preparation for a Milestone C/Full Rate Production decision.

MASS PERSONNEL DECON (MPD)

The MPD program will develop the equipment, processes and procedures for DoD-affiliated personnel contaminated by chemical, biological, and radiological agents to achieve ambulatory and non-ambulatory throughput requirements as dictated by the needs of the Services, while considering various mission scenarios. As part of the acquisition strategy, key product developmental efforts will begin with the program achieving a MS A in 1QFY20, and includes efforts for the reduction of current MPD System costs by assessing existing Mass Casualty Decontamination (MCD) equipment and processes as well as new technology through the use of Requests
For Information (RFI's), Market Research Analyses and Technology Demonstrations. Data collected from prior equipment demonstrations as well as fieldings of commercial MCD systems in support of two validated Operational Needs Statements will inform the program as well. A competitive/sole source contract for prototyping and production units will be awarded, followed by Milestone B.  Results of Prototyping will inform developmental and operational testing effort, followed by Milestone C/Full Rate Production Approval. These efforts will additionally support the development of hazardous waste disposal and integration with a Contaminated Human Remains capability.

SERVICE EQUIPMENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (SEDS)

The SEDS program will utilize the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Authority (CWMD OTA) to design and develop state of the art equipment using competitive and iterative prototyping. The program will test prototypes against live chemical warfare agents and biological warfare agents, conduct reliability, availability, and maintainability testing, conduct regular user evaluations to identify human system integration issues, and will conduct testing to ensure the system meets military standards.

TACTICAL DISABLEMENT SYSTEM (TACDS)

TacDS is being developed as a FoS using GOTS, modified COTS, and developmental technologies of varying maturity; up to 7 products may be needed to fully satisfy the entire requirements set. The FoS program structure of TacDS was developed with streamlining in mind, allowing flexible development of multiple products to optimize the use of available resources and for the PMO to quickly adapt to shifting priorities and initiate or expedite development of specific products as resources permit. A tailored/streamlined approach to acquisition documentation ensures robust program and risk management while ensuring effective utilization of available personnel resources and more efficient staffing, while product/technology-specific streamlining opportunities are being evaluated and implemented to the maximum extent possible as each product is advanced.

The TacDS FoS program successfully obtained a MS A decision authorizing entry of all capabilities to be developed under the program into the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase of the Acquisition Lifecycle in March 2018. Two products have since been advanced and are currently progressing through an approved streamlined A to C acquisition approach; Product #1, Thermite Bag, a man-portable destruction capability, and Product #2, Epoxy Kit, a delay capability. An IPR will replace the traditional MS B checkpoint and be conducted for each product to authorize transition from TMRR to EMD phase activities. Concurrent development of two technologies leverages available manpower and distributes resources across multiple efforts to reduce cost and schedule. Streamlined acquisition documentation and T&amp;E procedures are being utilized in the development of both products as well as streamlined contracting mechanisms. Separate contracts/transactions will be used to develop, test, and procure each product, with the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Agreement (CWMD OTA) being used to maximum extent possible as a flexible mechanism to engage industry, drive competition, and reduce transaction timelines. Results of testing and user evaluations for each product will determine design maturity and facilitate identification of opportunities to further accelerate the schedule.  

In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review reduced this program for higher priorities.  The requirements and capability gaps will remain.  The Product #1 (Thermite Bag) will be developed in FY 20 to the advanced prototype stage.  Programmatic information and all Intellectual Property (IP) will be archived for later use if program is revived.  Product #2 (Epoxy Kit) will be accelerated in FY20 through Operational Test Phase and all data/IP will be transferred to SOCOM for procurement/fielding under their Title 10 Authority.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project includes the development of next generation individual protective ensembles (e.g., suits, boots, and gloves) that enable the Joint Forces to survive and continue the mission in Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) contaminated environments.

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Family of Systems (UIPE FoS) 
(2) UIPE FoS Gloves
(3) UIPE FoS General Purpose (GP) (i.e. Land)

UIPE FoS will develop a family of systems that will provide the broad spectrum of users with individual percutaneous protective equipment allowing the ability to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation in performance.  UIPE FoS will provide protection from operationally relevant traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.  

In FY21, UIPE FoS transitions to UIPE FoS GP (i.e. Land), UIPE FoS Air and UIPE FoS Gloves.  The family of systems is being developed based on agreed upon Service Mission Areas of which there are four: Land, Sea, Air, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas have unique mission requirements that the combined UIPE FoS solutions will fulfill. The overarching goal of each of the four Mission Areas is to minimize operational burden and provide improved form, fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.

UIPE FoS Gloves will provide percutaneous protection to the Warfighter against traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats. UIPE FoS Gloves will provide improved tactility and dexterity, and for some Mission Areas, a touchscreen capability.  

UIPE FoS GP (i.e. Land) will provide a family of systems that will give the Warfighter percutaneous protection from operationally relevant traditional, non-traditional, and advanced CBRN/Toxic Industrial Material (TIM) threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The UIPE FoS program will conduct market research through both Requests For Information (RFIs) and a call for White Papers through an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach. Candidate technologies will follow the same acquisition strategy employed for the suit: Early User Tests/Wear events and material and system level testing to identify available capabilities followed by a Trade Space Analysis to determine the most suitable glove(s). The UIPE FoS GP program will monitor S&amp;T activities for possible technology transitions.

In FY21, UIPE FoS transitions to UIPE FoS GP, UIPE FoS Air and UIPE FoS Gloves.   In order to reflect the structure of the program, UIPE FoS will meet Mission Area needs, not individual Service needs.  The four Mission Areas are: Land (i.e. GP), Air, Sea, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas has unique mission requirements that the UIPE FoS GP, Air and Gloves solutions will seek to fulfill.

UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTIVE ENSEMBLE FOS GLOVES (UIPE FOS GLOVES)

The UIPE FoS program will conduct market research through both Requests For Information (RFIs) and a call for White Papers through an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach. Candidate technologies will undergo Early User Tests/Wear events and material and system level testing to identify available capabilities followed by a Trade Space Analysis to determine the most suitable solution(s).

UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTIVE ENSEMBLE GENERAL PURPOSE (UIPE FOS GP)

The UIPE FoS GP program utilized an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach to procure informational white papers during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, prototypes, and test articles of possible solutions.  The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  The OTA yielded several different prototypes that are undergoing material and system level testing and Early User Tests. Along with the OTA prototypes, the program is exploring the feasibility of a layered concept designed by the government and a manufacturing partner.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) responsible for providing the information architecture and applications for shaping the battlespace against the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threat. Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Global Biosurveillance Portal (Global-BSP),
(2) CBRN Integrated Early Warning (CBRN IEW), 
(3) Joint Effects Model 2 (JEM 2),
(4) Joint Warning and Reporting Network 2 (JWARN 2), and
(5) Software Support Activity (SSA).

The Global-BSP is an unclassified, web-based computer and mobile application which facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the preparedness, detection, management, and mitigation of CBRN, as well as all hazard events.  These capabilities enable the use of data visualization, real-time messaging and file sharing, and DoD and USG cooperation to expedite the timely identification and detection of CBRN events in order to minimize operational impacts to the local and global populations.

CBRN IEW is a continuation of ECD IEW (CBRN IEW has transitioned from Project Contamination Avoidance (CA4) to Project Information Systems (IS4)). CBRN IEW will utilize residual capabilities from the Capabilities to Enable NBC Threat Awareness Understanding and Reporting (CENTAUR) deployed to Eighth Army as well as ECD IEW lessons learned to transition and integrate successful mature technologies into a baseline IEW framework to support environmental monitoring and biological surveillance to support immediate force health protection requirements.  Applicable technologies within the CBDP will be experimented, integrated, networked, and deployed through rapid acquisition methods and transitioned to programs of record to achieve integrated early warning in accordance with OSD IEW Campaign Plan.  CBRN IEW will utilize Table-Top exercises (TTX), Operational Demonstrations, and other venues to provide sensor interoperability and interdependence and integrated layered defense in order to increase readiness within the CBDP.

The JEM 2 is a software application that provides the Department of Defense (DoD) with the only operationally tested and accredited tool to model and simulate the effects of CBRN weapon strikes and incidents. JEM 2 applies advanced physics using weather, terrain, and agent characteristics to predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM). JEM 2 displays hazard information on the Common Operational Picture (COP) and allows commanders to assess risk and take steps to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) on operational forces.

The JWARN 2 is a software application that provides the DoD with a warning and reporting system that enables an immediate and integrated response to threats of contamination by WMD, CBRN, and TIM incidents.  JWARN 2 provides a digital display of CBRN reports on the COP, presented through Service-provided Command and Control systems resident at all echelons of command. Enhanced situational battlespace awareness provides Commanders the ability to support warfighter battle management and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.

The SSA provides for enterprise services in the areas of software development, system/network architectures, cybersecurity, technology transition, and information assurance standards and policies to support programs in the evaluation of emerging technologies for transition, standards compliance, interoperability, and cybersecurity risk management framework development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Global-BSP program is using the SOFCIDS (Special Operations Capabilities Integration and Development System) requirements approach and the JROC's "IT Box" acquisition construct which allows fielding of operational capabilities while continued R&amp;D matures technology required for follow-on versions.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple iterative fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event, and field products to the warfighter utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  The Global-BSP will achieve Full Operational Capability, complete resourced capabilities, and commence an orderly transition to sustainment in 2020.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

CBRN INTEGRATED EARLY WARNING (CBRN IEW)

CBRN IEW Focuses on technology maturation, demonstration, integration and transitioning early warning capability sets to fielded CBDP programs of record to combat emerging and potentially urgent threats within the multi-domain operations spectrum. Contracting strategy includes the use of Other Transaction Authority R&amp;D and prototyping. Annual development cycles and capability drops are requested and validated by all DOD services in the OSD DAS(D) IEW Campaign Plan and prioritized based on National Defense Strategy and National Military Strategy goals. Current strategy also collaborates with multi-agency partners to obtain synergy and interoperability across the areas of sensor data analytics, integrated early warning, and protect to warn/protect to treat capabilities.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

The JEM 2 acquisition strategy utilizes Agile software development practices, employing the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fieldings in lieu of a single fielding event.  As part of the strategy, an over-arching Milestone B and Build Decision for Requirements Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) were approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in 4QFY14.  Subsequent RDPs have been approved along with Capability Drops (CD) that define capability sets to be developed, tested, and fielded operationally.  JEM will prioritize and complete resourced CD's for RDP 1 and 2 to transition into sustainment.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 acquisition utilizes Agile software development practices, employing the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fieldings in lieu of a single fielding event.  As part of the strategy, an over-arching MS B and Build Decision for Requirements Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) were approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in 4QFY14.  Subsequent RDPs have been approved along with Capability Drops (CD) that define capability sets to be developed, tested, and fielded operationally.  JWARN will prioritize and complete resourced CD's for RDP 1 and 2 to transition into sustainment.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project includes Medical Countermeasure platform technologies, Medical Countermeasures (vaccines and therapeutics), development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Biosafety Level 4 Good Laboratory Practice Test and Evaluation (BSL4 GLP T&amp;E)
(2) Chem Bio Incident Preparedness and Response - Biosafety Level 4 Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (CBIPR - BSL4 RIID)
(3) Chem Bio Incident Preparedness and Response - Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CBIPR - ADM)
(4) Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B)
(5) Medical Countermeasure Platform Technologies (MCMPT)
(6) Next Generation Diagnostic System 2 (NGDS Increment 2)
(7) NGDS 2 Chemical Diagnostics (NGDS 2 CHEMDX)
(8) Filovirus Vaccine (VAC FILO)
(9) Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC VEE)

The Medical Countermeasure BSL-4 GLP T&amp;E capability performs T&amp;E and provides the essential data packages to support US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of leading biodefense medical countermeasure candidates to protect the Warfighter and the Nation.  This capability provides dedicated capacity at U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) for Department of Defense (DoD) to conduct biosafety level studies to meet programmatic needs following all applicable regulatory, biosurety, and safety standards.  

The capability building effort at the DoD ADM will establish and enhance proven biopharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing technologies to accelerate the delivery of medical countermeasures as part of a medical integrated layered defense. The return on investment is an increased level of preparedness and responsiveness to counter current and emerging chemical and biological threats.  By establishing and enhancing proven enabling technologies, the DoD ADM will accelerate development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) at all stages of development, enhance preparedness for existing threats, and accelerate response to emerging threats.  MCMs impacted by these efforts include: Vaccines for Viral Agents, Vaccines for Bacterial Agents and Toxins, Monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody conjugates for therapeutic and prophylactic use across all agent classes, and Adjuvants.  Funds to support the state of readiness were previously provided through individual product development and manufacturing funding lines. The Department is providing dedicated funds (CBIPR-ADM) to support operational availability.

The CMDR-B program develops MCMs for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins. The resulting product(s) will be FDA approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.  The candidate drug was approved by the FDA in Oct 2018 for Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CAPB) that was required as part of the acquisition strategy for the antibiotic repurposing program from S&amp;T to advanced development. 

MCMPT is establishing enabling technologies and pre positioning platform systems at the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the medical countermeasure (MCM) development risks. Efforts will center on leveraging the ADM's facility and developing robust manufacturing processes. MCMPT will leverage platform technologies to streamline and accelerate the MCM delivery to the Force by reducing developmental risk. A subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats. Through the Advanced Development and Manufacturing Antibody Technologies (ADAMANT) and Rapid Response platforms, MCMPT will deliver an enduring capability from which future candidates can be manufactured. The Agile Medical Paradigm (AMP) is the CBDP's strategic framework to accelerate the delivery of MCMs. To achieve this goal the DoD is establishing a medical countermeasures platform technology (MCMPT) capability.  

The NGDS is a family of systems providing increments of diagnostic capabilities over time that address varied chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) threats across the different echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBR threat and infectious disease identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance. NGDS Increment 1 improves diagnostic capabilities in deployable and laboratory-based combat health support units. NGDS Increment 1 offers improved operational suitability and affordability over legacy systems by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on an existing commercial diagnostic device with a well-established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests. NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.  NGDS Increment 2 will provide additional capability for diagnosis of CBR-induced diseases, suitable for use in far forward environments, by developing lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use instruments and test kits.  In FY21 NGDS Increment 2 has been broken out into two separate programs; NGDS 2 Man Portable Diagnostic System (MPDS) Program and NGDS 2 CHEMDX Program. NGDS 2 MPDS will complement NGDS Increment 1 by providing a lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use diagnostic capability to end-users in non-laboratory, far-forward environments. NGDS 2 CHEMDX will provide a lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use diagnostic capability to end-users in non-laboratory, far-forward environments.

The VAC FILO Program develops vaccines that will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses. The program office is prioritizing the development and delivery of a licensed Marburg vaccine while working with Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) to further develop Ebola vaccine candidates to meet the DoD requirement.  The current budget supports responsibly shelving program development efforts until prototype transition from our S&amp;T partners.  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve a vaccine using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in a relevant animal model(s).

The VAC VEE Program develops a vaccine that will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner with Health and Human Services/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (HHS/NIAID), DoD agencies, and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Joint Science Technology Office (JSTO) and other agencies.  This DoD program is the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCM) BSL-4 T&amp;E capability continues to utilize and maintain a testing capability at the existing and planned new USAMRIID facilities.  MCM BSL-4 T&amp;E costs support testing of MCMs against threats that require high-level containment using non-human primates.  The period of FY18 and beyond will continue to support the BSL-4 T&amp;E capability.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review reduced this program for higher priorities.

CHEM BIO INCIDENT PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE - BIOSAFETY LEVEL 4 RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES (CBIPR-BSL4 RIID)

The Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCM) BSL-4 T&amp;E capability continues to utilize and maintain a testing capability at the existing and planned new USAMRIID facilities.  MCM BSL-4 T&amp;E costs support testing of MCMs against threats that require high-level containment using non-human primates.  The period of FY18 and beyond will continue to support the BSL-4 T&amp;E capability.

CHEM BIO INCIDENT PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE - ADM

A contract was awarded to Ology Bioservices on 20 March 2013 (then Nanotherapeutics, Inc.) to establish a Department of Defense (DoD) ADM Facility to rapidly develop, approve (through FDA approval), and manufacture MCMs.  The contract was structured to be executed in two (2) phases:

Phase 1-Establish, commission and validate (facility(ies)/ equipment) for two (2) advanced development and manufacturing suites that use agile, flexible (single use, disposable), modular and multi-product technologies for MCM advanced development and manufacturing. Both suites must meet Biological Safety Level-3 (BSL-3) standards.  Phase 1 was completed on 31 March 2017.

Phase 2-Support and maintain that capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (under the animal rule as applicable) and manufacturing and assist in training personnel in its use. This includes transition and integration of new technologies, from Pre-Investigational New Drug Application phase with readiness to support simultaneous operations, through FDA licensure.  The first sustainment option (POP 2 years) was completed in 2QFY19; the subsequent sustainment option began thereafter and is scheduled for completion in 4QFY20, but can be extended until 2QFY21 if needed.

COUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)

The CMDR-B program develops MCMs for Service members for protection against MDR bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. The candidate is a transitional product from S&amp;T that showed efficacy against plague, anthrax, and other BW agents. The regulatory approach of the program is to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule. The program will conduct non-human primate studies to confirm efficacy.  The performer will develop and submit an IFC package to FDA for emergency use to support the warfighter preparedness against MDR. The performer will submit Supplemental New Drug Application for the therapeutic during the EMD Phase.  In FY18 PK study on non-human primates was completed for the plague indication and results were analyzed against threat indication. Continued coordination with FDA for supplemental indication of anthrax based on threat level to the warfighter.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review reduced this program for higher priorities.

MCM PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES (MCMPT)

The goal of the MCMPT is to rapidly counter a broad-spectrum of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  Efforts will focus on establishing advanced platform technologies within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and evaluating that capability through nonclinical and clinical testing. A subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats. Once established, future programs will be able to leverage these platforms for the development of future medical countermeasures.  It is anticipated that these efforts will leverage the Other Transactions Authority (OTA) through the medical OTA consortium.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS 1 program was a MS A to MS C - acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 is replacing the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. NGDS 1 Full Rate Production was approved in Aug 2018.

NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 continued the technology maturation and risk reduction of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY18 and transitioned to engineering and manufacturing development phase in FY19.  NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a chemical diagnostic capability in FY18. Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements. Development efforts are cost-plus awards using Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings. NGDS 2 is broken out into NGDS 2 CHEMDx and NGDS 2 MPDS starting in FY21.

NEXT GEN DIAG 2 CHEMICAL DIAGNOSTICS (NGDS 2 CHEMDX)

NGDS Increment 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 CHEMDX will provide a lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use diagnostic capability against chemical threat agents to end-users in non-laboratory, far-forward environments.  NGDS 2 CHEMDX initiated prototyping in FY18 and will conclude prototyping in FY21. NGDS 2 CHEMDX is using an Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreement to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings. NGDS 2 CHEMDX program is broken out from the NGDS Increment 2 program starting in FY21.

FILOVIRUS (VAC FILO)

The Filovirus Vaccine Program acquisition strategy develops products for pre-exposure prophylaxis that will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses, with the initial increment focused on Marburg.  The current budget supports responsibly shelving program development efforts until prototype transition from our Science and Technology (S&amp;T) partners.  Work to develop and qualify necessary assays is on-going to support successful transitions of potential Marburg and Ebola candidates from S&amp;T.  Assays will be used to compare transitioned products in order to have a meaningful down select at Milestone B (MS B).  At MS B, the best pre-exposure prophylaxis prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the delivery of an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed Marburg pre-exposure prophylactic product.  It is anticipated that the EMD phase contract will be a mix of Cost Plus and Fixed Price.  In addition, the program office may leverage the Advanced Development and Manufacturing capability, and other DoD agencies and laboratories to include the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  Following a successful MS B, the program will conduct manufacturing qualification/validation, expanded clinical and nonclinical testing, and assay qualification and validation efforts.  These efforts will support the Biological Licensure Application (BLA) submission to the FDA and licensure of a Marburg pre-exposure prophylactic product.

VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (VAC VEE)

The VAC VEE acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and Virus Like Particle (VLP) vaccine prototypes through Phase I clinical trials to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Maturation &amp; Risk Reduction phase and one of these candidates will be selected to fill the gap with the Services until a future S&amp;T candidate is ready for transition into advanced development with a successful Phase 1 clinical trial.  Several potential decision points will be used to assess the prototypes at competitive selection from MS B to MS C.  The schedule is based on a competitive selection to one prototype at MS C with delivery of a FDA-licensed VEE vaccine.  The current S&amp;T efforts do not have a potential candidate with a completed Phase I clinical trial until FY24, therefore the current effort of the MVA and VLP will be the candidates utilized for the MS B down select until a future candidate can be assessed for advanced development.  The current candidates are based on development of known mature vaccine platforms with potential to utilize the DoD Advanced Development Manufacturing facility for production.  The development efforts will be a Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price CLINs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary for the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase of the acquisition life cycle for the advanced development of Medical Countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical warfare agents including diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds.  A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Emerging Threats (EMRT)
(2) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) 

EMRT program is developing and fielding of FDA-approved therapeutic medical countermeasures (MCMs). The purpose of the MCM is to provide therapeutic benefits to the Joint Service warfighter against operational exposures to the opioid class of pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs) as a high priority. The EMRT program is called the Rapid Opioid Countermeasure System (ROCS) in FY20 MC5.  ROCS will use MC5 funds for advanced development of a 10 mg naloxone autoinjector as a rescue therapeutic to treat against operational opioid exposure. 

The INATS advanced development provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  Components of the development include (1) a new and improved oxime (replacing 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) to treat current and emerging threats and (2) insertion of a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>EMERGING THREAT CHEMICAL THERAPEUTICS (EMRT)

The EMRT program transitioned to Rapid Opioid Countermeasure System (ROCS) in FY20 using MC5 funds.  

EMRT program is developing and fielding of FDA-approved therapeutic medical countermeasures (MCMs). The purpose of the MCM is to provide therapeutic benefits to the Joint Service warfighter against operational exposures to the opioid class of pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs) as a high priority. The first increment of the EMRT program will develop a naloxone autoinjector as a rescue treatment that will counteract the adverse effects from exposure to opioids. The program will use MC5 funds in FY20 to develop and gain FDA approval the autoinjector.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

The INATS (MC4) program concludes as INATS in FY19. 

In the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) phase, close collaborations will occur with the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies and clinical safety studies.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, the Government will engage with commercial partner(s) to ensure that INATS CA development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities, resulting in only the INATS CA component being pursued.

The INATS (MC7) line initiates in FY20 and transitions to INATS CA (MC7) in FY21.  INATS (MC7) will support the modernization of Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP) using contract actions to extend operational shelf-life and generate data to expand storage temperature conditions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The CBMAI funding (BA4-5) is required to provide existing and future test fixtures and methodology to support advanced development test and evaluation intended to meet a changing threat regardless of the test site/location. These activities support current PoRs (e.g., UIPE FoS, NBCRV SSU, etc.) as well as future PoRs such as interdependent contamination mitigation (C3PO, WADS, SEDS), future protective mask programs (i.e., M50 Tech Refresh), remote detection (air to ground/C-SIRP) and integrated early warning (IEW).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort reduces programmatic risk of failure in the advanced development phase by generating clinical and supporting non-clinical safety, tolerability and toxicity data for candidate vaccines and therapeutic drugs prior to transition to System Development &amp; Demonstration.

Individual efforts in this project include:
- Supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging biological warfare threat agents. 
- Demonstration of human safety and tolerability prior to entry of candidate vaccines and therapeutics into advanced development, supporting the preparation of technical data packages that conform to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.
- In addition, this project supports innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat emerging biological threats whether naturally occurring or engineered.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies from laboratory experiments to acquisition programs through risk reduction, engineering and integration. These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness. Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated. Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can either be left in place for extended user evaluations, accepted into advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full-scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development.
This project funds efforts to enhance technology transition for two Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) areas: Integrated Early Warning (IEW), and Integrated Layered Defense (ILD). The IEW ATD family of products achieve enhanced command and control decision making capabilities as a result of a combined and orchestrated family of chemical and biological defense systems deployed on various platforms in strategic locations. The ILD ATD family of products achieve solutions for capability gaps across medical and non-medical commodity areas to enable warfighter survival and rapid recovery in CBRN environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) exploit mature and maturing technologies to solve important military problems. ATDs emphasize technology integration, operational utility assessment, and transition of operational prototypes for practical use. The goals of efforts under the TT4 project are to provide a prototype capability to the Warfighter and support the evaluation of that capability in operationally-relevant field environments. This will allow Warfighters to evaluate the capabilities in real military exercises and at a scale sufficient to fully assess military utility. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) will fund DoD laboratories and DoD Federally Funded Research Development Centers (FFRDCs) through the Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) in accordance with the Economy Act in order to conduct operational evaluation of technology solutions for Integrated Early Warning (IEW) and Integrated Layered Defense (ILD) ATD efforts. Upon completion of efforts under this project, operational prototypes of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or TRL 7 with documented operational utility assessment outcomes will be transitioned to Service stakeholders and programs of record to support rapid acquisition and fielding decisions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The projects in this program element (PE) support the development, build, and test of products to verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and to support production or deployment decisions.  The activities include mature system development, integration, and demonstration to support Milestone C decisions, and conducting operational test and evaluation of production representative articles. 

Individual projects include:
- Contamination Avoidance (CA5): system development of reconnaissance, detection, identification, and warning systems that minimize chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contamination and prevent further cross-contamination during operations.

- Homeland Defense (CM5): system development of common analytical laboratory system capabilities to conduct on-site analysis of any unknown sample and test potential life-threatening substances.

- Collective Protection. (CO5): system development of collectively protected systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination.

- Decontamination (DE5): system development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that will remove/eliminate and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.

- Individual Protection (IP5): system development of the next generation protective ensembles (e.g., suits, boots, and gloves) and respiratory and ocular protection equipment (e.g., protective masks) which enable the Joint Force to operate in a contaminated CBR environment with little or no degradation to his/her performance.  

- Information Systems (IS5): system development of information architectures, applications, and cybersecurity hardening for shaping the battlespace against CBR threats.

- Medical Biological Defense (MB5): product development of medical biological countermeasure platform technologies, medical biological countermeasures (vaccines and therapeutics), reagents, assays, and diagnostic equipment to provide an effective capability for medical defense against biological warfare agent threats facing U.S. Forces in the field.

- Medical Chemical Defense (MC5): product development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items (e.g., diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds) necessary to provide an effective capability for medical defense against chemical warfare agent threats facing U.S. Forces in the field.

- Test and Evaluation (TE5): critical test capabilities, planning, and infrastructure improvements/modifications necessary to evaluate CBRN Defense systems in realistic operating environments.

The projects in this PE support the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition system and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems.  

Efforts included in this Project are: 
(1) Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS)
(2) Mounted Enhanced Radiac Long Range Imaging Networkable (MERLIN)
(3) Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD)
(4) Multi-Phase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD)
(5) Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD)
(6) CBRN Sensor Integration on Robotics Platforms (CSIRP)
(7) Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD)
(8) the Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiatives (GBTI)
(9) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS)
(10) Joint Handheld Bio-Agent Identifier (JHBI)
(11) Joint Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological System (JNBCRS) 1, also known as Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRV SS)
(12) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense Support, and
(13) the Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA)

The MMPRDS program includes two sets of mounted radiological and nuclear sensors: the MERLIN and the Vehicle Integrated Platform Enhanced Radiac (VIPER), both of which originate with technology transitions from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  MMPRDS will sunset at the end of FY20.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities, resulting in only the MERLIN program (Project Number CA5) being pursued.

MERLIN is a set of externally mounted sensors used in joint operations on the Stryker NBCRV Sensor Suite Upgrade with the potential for integration on other Army platforms within the formation.  The system supports manned and unmanned platform-mounted reconnaissance and surveillance of radiological and nuclear hazards at standoff distances.  It is the first and only standoff radiological and nuclear detection capability for the Army; all previously fielded detectors require platforms to travel dangerously close to hazardous areas to detect radiological threats, which puts manned platform crews at risk of radiation exposure and presents contamination issues for the vehicle (be it manned or unmanned).  The MERLIN funding lines in FY21 and beyond support integration of the MERLIN system designed for the NBCRV.

AVCAD will fill critical gaps in current chemical sensor capabilities in the areas of aerosol Chemical Warfare Agent detection, and detection of specific advanced threat agents/Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs).  The AVCAD will also detect residual vapors to prevent/mitigate health effects associated with low concentration exposures. The U.S. Military Departments view the AVCAD as a high-priority program and will use the system to support their missions, which include monitoring, collective protection, base defense, decontamination, unmasking, reconnaissance, and shipboard and aviation platform chemical detection. 

The MPCAD is two-man portable system that will conduct near real-time, near-laboratory grade analysis of solid, liquid, and vapor samples collected by the operator in a presumptively contaminated area.  The MPCAD results will support the Commander's tactical and operational decisions regarding maneuver, protection, decontamination, and treatment measures. The Army and Marine Corp will employ MPCAD in Dismounted Reconnaissance and Site Assessment missions to substantiate presumptive detector results. The Air Force will employ the MPCAD to support Post-Event Reconnaissance in support of Reconnaissance and Surveillance missions by monitoring the environment at airbases after a chemical release. The Air Force will continuously monitor contaminated areas for chronic health effects levels through analysis of samples from collectors deployed at the contamination site and brought back to the analyzer for identification and quantification. This information will support commander decisions to determine Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) levels and eventual termination of cordon restrictions. In FY20, MPCAD is continuing testing to support EMD development. In FY21, MPCAD will complete the EMD phase and prepare for Milestone C / LRIP decision in FY22.

The PCAD provides the Joint Services a handheld capability to locate and detect trace amounts of NTA liquids and a chemical capability for solid surface detection.  Efforts to mature technologies during Technology Maturation Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase resulted in systems that were too heavy and cumbersome to use.  Program office is working with users and JSTO to identify technologies to mature that may meet the users' needs for a hand held, non-contact, areal detection system.  Concurrently with the PCAD TMRR efforts, Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Chemical Biological Center (CBC) was exploring the use of adapting the Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) to detect explosives.  A JCAD is inserted into a cradle that has a heated inlet and modified library to detect explosives. The effort was expanded for the system to detect NTAs, and Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBAs) and is called JCAD Solid/Liquid Adapter (SLA). The JCAD SLA kit is planned to be added to the M4A1 JCAD program as an Additional Authorized List (AAL) item. In FY20 the JCAD SLA will use the JCAD BA7 line. 

CSIRP is a prototyping and fielding effort that will miniaturize and integrate modular CBRN sensors with Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) Programs of Record (PORs).  CSIRP will provide situational awareness across the echelons of command in order to enable freedom of maneuver and action on the battlefield.  An integrated CSIRP capability will exploit advances in machine learning and autonomy.  Additional capabilities include sensing and communication, timely and accurate detection, warning and reporting of CBRN hazards.  This reduces risk at tactical and operational echelons in mounted and dismounted configurations.  CSIRP gives the Joint Force an opportunity to enhance capabilities and maintain operational advantage in multi domain operations.

The EMBD is the Navy's automated biological point detection, collection and identification system.  EMBD replaces/upgrades the 135 Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) currently fielded to the Navy and provides 40 systems for new construction ships.  EMBD improves detection sensitivity providing the Navy the ability to "detect to inform" reducing the number of contaminated ships during a biological warfare agent attack and minimizing sailor casualties. EMBD reduces false alarm rates, modernizes the computing architecture and increases reliability and sailors confidence in the system.  These improvements decrease fleet O&amp;S costs, and reduces the obsolescence issues with current biological detection capability. The EMBD program will test, produce, integrate and field a lower cost biological point detection system. In FY20, EMBD will complete EMD (Engineering and Manufacturing Development) DT/OT (Developmental Testing/Operational Testing) and move to Milestone C.

GBTI will research and characterize laboratory networks and develop algorithms to identify key nodes, having the greatest potential to compress the time between disease event initiation and the production of actionable data.  In FY19, GBTI will close.  The Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) will track projects of mutual interest, formerly under GBTI, with the Chemical Biological Defense Program.  The Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) an initiative under Defense Biological Product Assurance Program (DBPAO) will leverage the investments made under GBTI.  The (TARMAC) effort will transition to the Defense Biological Products Assurance Program (DBPAP) project MB5 line in FY20.

The JBTDS is the first tactical lightweight, low-cost biological surveillance system to detect, collect, and identify Biological Warfare Agent (BWA) aerosols.  JBTDS components are man-portable, battery-operable and easy to employ by any military user.  JBTDS provides notification of a hazard and enhances battle space awareness to protect and preserve the forces and is capable of archiving a sample for follow up analysis.  When networked, JBTDS augments existing biological detection systems providing a theater-wide array capable of biological detection, identification and warning to support time sensitive force protection decisions.  The JBTDS provides surface sampling capability which interfaces with the JBTDS identifier to support sensitive site exploitation missions.  In FY20, JBTDS will complete development of components and deliver systems for record test and evaluation.  

The JHBI program is a Joint Service Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program consisting of two increments to address an existing United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requirement for handheld, multiplexed, environmental, bio-agent identification.  The JHBI program was initiated under the JBTDS program and transitioned to its own funding line in FY18.  JHBI will provide two different handheld bio-identification systems for the rapid and accurate identification of organisms at the point of contact for multiple mission types.  The proposed JHBI systems will be handheld, Polymerase Chain Reaction-based, multiplexed devices for the analysis of powder or liquid environmental biological samples.  JHBI capabilities will provide Special Operations Forces with timely and accurate identification of eight or more bio-agents at the point of need.  JHBI 1 is anticipated to serve as a supplemental capability to the BioFire RAZOR with JHBI 2 fielding the complete replacement of the RAZOR by FY20.  

The JNBCRS 1, including the Styker NBCRV SSU, provides maneuver formations the ability to conduct mounted reconnaissance and surveillance missions of CBRN named areas of interest (NAIs).  The NBCRV SSU will answer the commander's priority intelligence requirements (PIR), and facilitate proactive risk-based decisions to ensure freedom of action and survivability.  A modern and capable NBCRV SSU is a critical component for Joint Force success when operating in the complex CBRN environment.  Operating with combat vehicles fighting against increasingly capable and determined enemies requires like capability with regard to protection, mobility, and lethality.  The NBCRV SSU will accomplish this by integrating the capability for command and control of unmanned systems with CBRN payload.  The NBCRV SSU will provide a CBRN detection, tipping and queuing system to accomplish desired standoff distances to keep the warfighter out of harm's way and reduce sustainment costs over the current system.  A Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuver speed when conducting NBC missions and increase reliability.  This schedule was accelerated from the previous schedule based on the maturity of the sensor and guidance from the Chief of Staff of the Army.  In FY20, NBCRV SSU program will develop a prototype of integrated sensors for demonstration in Joint Warfighter Assessment 2020.

The NTA Defense program is the lead for DoD, Interagency, and international work pertaining to Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBAs) and other emerging threats. The NTA Defense program assesses existing and new portfolio capabilities against PBAs and other emerging threats to develop dedicated initiatives and projects to transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition programs across all non-medical commodity areas.  System prototyping, modification, and integration efforts serve to advance capabilities, reduce risk, and provide improved knowledge for decision making. 

The ROSETTA is a modernization effort to provide a higher confidence chemical liquid hazard detection ticket in the currently fielded M256A2 kit for the Warfighter to make timely decisions.  These decisions will reduce casualties and improve the combat effectiveness of troops engaged in conflicts involving the use of chemical warfare agents. ROSETTA is based on colorimetric technology and will be eye-readable and ease the Warfighter from current training and operational burden.  In addition, the ROSETTA ticket will provide improved hazard detection performance with reduced false alarm rate, potential for increased number of chemicals detected, reduced detection time especially for certain compounds of interest, and potential for integration onto unmanned platforms. The ROSETTA funding will complete the development and testing of the new ROSETTA ticket as well as update the currently fielded M256A2 technical data package via an engineering change proposal (ECP) to create a new M256A3 kit that will be available to all Services. In FY20, ROSETTA will award contract(s) for technical data package testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The MMPRDS program transitioned the VIPER and MERLIN radiological/nuclear sensor technologies from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), rapidly mature the systems with industry, and begin fielding via modification work orders (MWOs) to directly replace legacy mounted capabilities for the Army.  Sensor development and testing will continue in FY19-20 using separate Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for VIPER and MERLIN.  The program plans to award production contracts in FY20 to support production verification testing and initial/rapid fielding to the Joint Nuclear Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Systems (JNBCRS) sensor suite upgrade platform under conditional materiel release.  MMPRDS will sunset at the end of FY20 and transition to a separate line of effort for MERLIN.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities, resulting in only the MERLIN program being pursued.

MOUNTED ENHANCED RADIAC LONG RANGE IMAGING NETWORKABLE (MMPRDS MERLIN)

The MERLIN BA5 line covers risk reduction efforts for the possible integration of the MERLIN system onto other Army platforms within the formation.  The work will be accomplished through competition using an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) utilizing the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) OTA.

AEROSOL VAPOR CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (AVCAD)

Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD) awarded two MS B Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts with production options. The AVCAD program is conducting risk reduction testing with prototypes prior to full EMD DT Record Testing in support of the Milestone C decision.  The program intends to conduct P&amp;D phase testing with LRIP units from both vendors if supported by EMD Record Test Data, to promote FRP price competition.

MULTI-PHASE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (MPCAD)

The Multi-Phase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD) (formerly NGCD 3) is using a streamlined acquisition strategy.  The MPCAD EMD contract(s) are utilizing the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for EMD and LRIP items.  The MPCAD will procure production items through a follow-on CWMD OTA or Federal Acquisition Regulation based contract.  The program will develop and validate the systems during EMD utilizing two contractors to increase competition.

PROXIMATE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (PCAD)

The Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD) (formerly NGCD 2) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) reassessed the PCAD Capability requirement with each of the Joint Services and determined the state of technologies necessary to meet the user's capability needs are not yet mature. The program will transition back to S&amp;T to further mature technology via a competitive contract in FY21. In the interim, the program office will support the operational test of the JCAD SLA kit and complete the logistical analysis to incorporate the JCAD SLA kit as an Additional Authorized List (AAL) item to the M4A1 JCAD.

CBRN SENSOR INTEGRATION ON ROBOTIC PLATFORMS (CSIRP)

CSIRP is a streamlined acquisition effort to rapidly prototype and field capabilities distinct from the traditional acquisition system.  CSIRP will provide unmanned CBRN payload prototypes in 2 year prototyping plan cycles based on service requirements.   The prototyping plans will utilize a streamlined acquisition process in order to keep pace with industry and the rapid advancement of technologies.  The CSIRP strategy is to utilize the rapid prototyping process enabled by the Other Transactional Agreements (OTA) contract vehicle.  Upon award, the awardees will have up to two years to produce prototype CBRN sensors that are integrated onto service chosen (air and/or ground) platforms.  These prototypes will be demonstrated, evaluated and tested by the services as well as laboratories and academia.  The most successful will be transitioned to the services for the next steps in acquisition, production and eventual fielding across the services.  BA4 funding will provide market research to support the refinement and the building of technologically mature prototypes.  BA5 funding will provide demonstrations, testing and operational assessments to support transition decisions to POR or sustained capability of the prototypes.

ENHANCED MARITIME BIOLOGICAL DETECTION (EMBD)

The Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) program uses a streamlined acquisition strategy and acquired a Milestone B decision in June 2018.  EMBD will replace/upgrade 135 Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) in the Navy and provide 40 systems for new construction ships.  In July 2018 EMBD awarded a contract through Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition and Production/Procurement (JE-RDAP) contract for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) in FY20.

GLOBAL BIO TECH INITIATIVE (GBTI)

The Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiative (GBTI) strategy establishes a robust data stream that directly supports existing programs of record in their development of biological defense countermeasures through the characterization of laboratory networks and augmentation of key nodes within those networks.  This will be accomplished through the use of a University of Affiliated Research Center (Johns Hopkins University) to characterize laboratory networks and develop decision-making tools for evaluating potential augmentation of key nodes prior to investment.  The GBTI program is sun-setting.  FY19 will be the last year of funding.

JOINT BIO TACTICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (JBTDS)

The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) program awarded a full and open contract to Chemring Sensors and Electronic Systems (CSES) in the 3rd Quarter of FY15 for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).  Based on the results at Biological Point System Assessment (BPSA), JBTDS will integrate TacBio II as the detector and Joint Handheld Biological Identifier (JHBI) as the identification capability.  These technologies will offer significant production and O&amp;S cost savings.

JOINT HANDHELD BIO-AGENT IDENTIFIER (JHBI)

The JHBI program will pursue a collaborative accelerated acquisition strategy.  JHBI will use commercial items to procure candidate systems from two vendors for further development and fielding.  The JHBI program acquired test-articles of a single commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) platform with relevant assays for the JHBI Combat Evaluation (CV), which served as the decision gate for the completion of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase.  To mitigate risk, additional technologies were identified and inserted into the JHBI program.  JHBI transitioned to production in FY20.

JOINT NBC RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEM - STRYKER (JNBCRS)

Joint Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological System (JNBCRS), includes the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite Upgrade (NBCRV SSU).  The acquisition strategy for the Stryker NBCRV SSU is to integrate mature sensors into the Stryker NBCRV to support Joint Warfighter Assessment 2020 and system level testing.  Following the testing and demonstration, the hardware and software will be fixed and updated for government developmental and operational testing.  The Joint Warfighter Assessments will provide user feedback and operational data to support programmatic and technical decisions.  An In Progress Review will be held after Joint Warfighter Assessment 2020 and system testing to approve a Modification Work Order for fielding.  This schedule was accelerated from the previous schedule based on the maturity of the sensor and guidance from the Chief of Staff of the Army.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The NTA Defense program will transition information, technologies, and capabilities associated with Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBAs) and other emerging threats into existing and future acquisition programs utilizing a variety of contract mechanisms.

REACTIVE CHEMISTRY ORTHOGONAL SURFACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TICKET ARRAY (ROSETTA)

ROSETTA will use a streamlined approach. This approach is based on technology that will transition from Science and Technology Efforts and industry.  It will be developed using the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) OTA to award multiple development contracts. The M256A3 Production Contract will use Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) to purchase the new kits. The ROSETTA funding will complete the development and testing of the new ROSETTA ticket as well as update the currently fielded M256A2 technical data package via an engineering change proposal (ECP) to create a new M256A3 kit that will be available to all Services.

(1) Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS)

The CALS will provide common analytical capabilities packaged to meet the specific CONOPS and mission of the gaining unit to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs). Users of the system will include the National Guard Bureau, the Army 20th Support Command, the Army Medical Laboratory, the Air Force, and the Navy.  There will be two variants of CALS, the Theater Validation Integrated System (TV-IS) and the Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Sets (FC-ACS). TV-IS is currently in the EMD phase, with proto-types built and EMD testing that began in February 2019 and concludes in 2QFY2020.

Theater Validation Integrated System (TV-IS) Variant - Army User - A lab with a high level of confidence in analytical results through the use of orthogonal (complimentary) technologies and an expanded analytical suite that employs multiple standardized ISO containers, which will be integrated onto one Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) and two trailers. TV-IS is currently in the EMD phase, with EMD testing that concludes in early FY2020. The TV-IS Milestone C decision is currently scheduled for Mid FY2020 to enter into the Production &amp; Deployment Phase. 

Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Sets (FC-ACS) Variant - Army, Navy, Air Force and NGB User - A transportable equipment subset that allows
them to be loaded into transport cases and palletized if required. FC-ACS is post Milestone C and is not a RDTE funded part of CALS, it is in the production phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>COMMON ANALYTICAL LABORATORY SYSTEM (CALS)

The Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) will be developed leveraging both Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) analytical components to support the identification of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) agent materials in environmental samples.  CALS will consist of (2) variants which will be fielded, in accordance with mission need, to components of the Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy and National Guard Bureau requiring CBRN field confirmatory analytical detection capability. A theatre validation variant will be designed and built for a longer duration mission and for semi-permanent applications. An analytical capability suite variant will be designed for shorter duration field confirmatory missions.  JPdM CBRNE A&amp;RS awarded one contract during the EMD Phase. The contract was awarded to Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) (prime) to develop, deliver, manage, and maintain a CALS Technical Data Package (TDP) throughout the EMD Phase. The TDP to be delivered to the Government at the end of the EMD Phase is to include all product data required by the Production Level specifications outlined in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-31000A, and will reflect the tested baseline configuration incorporating all approved changes. As part of the common acquisition strategy, CALS is incorporating the NGDS platform to meet this threshold requirement; specifically to identify various bacterial and viral agents in the CALS integrated systems.  This platform provides the ability to analyze for bacterial and viral agents in various environmental, food, and water matrices (sample types).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production of Joint Service Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Collective Protection (CP) systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in CBR environments. This allows for a more resilient force posture, sustaining Joint Force military advantages and building a more lethal Force, efforts that align with the National Defense Strategy.

The systems included in this project are: 
(1) Chemical Biological Aircraft Survivability Barrier (CASB) 
(2) Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) Family of Systems

The CASB will provide a lightweight, low-cost, expendable, negative-pressure enclosure that will protect the interior of DoD multi-service aircraft assets (MH-47, CV22, MC-130) capable of airlifting/exfiltrating chemically or biologically contaminated personnel, equipment, and cargos while preserving the aircraft for continued unrestricted operations without the need for extensive decontamination.  CASB will field a capability that supports the overall intent of the Aircraft chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) Contamination Survivability (ACCS) Initial Capabilities Development (ICD) in the areas of barriers, aircraft containment systems, modular Collective Protection (ColPro) for aircraft interiors, and disposable ColPro.  CASB is one member of a family of systems that will support the ICD.  It will protect the interior from incidental cross-contamination by chemical and biological (CB)-contaminated personnel and equipment and cargos under transport.  

JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a collective protection capability that is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  JECP is a family of systems, developed in two phases, that will allow the application of collective protection to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  Phase 1 includes standalone collective protection systems and kits that provide existing host platforms and structures with CBRN protection.  Phase 2 includes kits that provide CBRN protection to other host platforms and structures that were not explicitly designed in Phase 1.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL AIRCRAFT SURVIVABILITY BARRIER (CASB)

The Chemical Biological Aircraft Survivability Barrier (CASB) overall strategy is to utilize primary materials (air filtration and flexible barrier material) currently in use by other programs in the CB defense portfolio.  CASB reviewed existing materials and technology as well as designs, configurations, and test data from legacy systems developed for ColPro applications.  Using this information, systems are being developed to meet the broader range of airframes and airframe specific requirements, chemical biological protection, and logistic supportability that are now required.  Based on commonality between the requirements of the CASB and the requirements of similar programs (i.e. Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection, TIS, and Aeromedical Biological Containment System), CASB initiated at MS B EMD phase to meet these expanded requirements within the various airframes.  CASB is leveraging an IDIQ contract to pursue a Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) development strategy using full and open competition for awards following MS C.  During the EMD phase, CASB awarded a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) delivery order for the development and delivery of prototypes for airworthiness certification within two years.

JOINT EXPEDITIONARY COLLECTIVE PROTECTION (JECP)

JECP Family of Systems (FoS) (Phase 1 and Phase 2) involves multiple contract types throughout the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Production and Deployment Phases of the program. Having achieved a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for Phase 1 Systems in December 2016, the program exercised Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) production options in FY17 &amp; FY18 through the now expired contract with Leidos in support of Initial Operational Capability (IOC). A competitive build-to print follow-on production delivery order contract was awarded June 2019 to Production Products Manufacturing and will support the remaining production of Phase 1 Systems to meet Full Operational Capability (FOC). Phase 2 systems will be developed as engineering changes to the Phase 1 systems under a separate competitive delivery order awarded March 2019 to Leidos and undergo limited developmental and operational testing in pursuit of a FRP decision. Production options are included in the delivery order to meet FOC for Phase 2 systems. Additionally, BA7 funding will develop incremental improvements to fielded JECP FoS. BA7 efforts include a range of improvements intended to enhance filtration protection, provide a field leakage test capability and update various fielded Environmental Control Unit (ECU) interface types for use with collective protection. These efforts involve development of designs and prototyping under the Other Transaction Authority (OTA) through the Countering Weapons Mass Destruction (CWMD) Consortium contract as well as exploitation of commercial off-the-shelf items.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment, helping sustain a resilient force posture, one of the efforts outlined in the National Defense Strategy.  ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations. Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, Concept of Operations and Tactics, Techniques &amp; Procedures.

Efforts included in this Project are:
(1) Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS)
(2) Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS)
(3) DFoS CIDAS Blister
(4) Forward Area Mobility Spray - System (FAMS-S)
(5) Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP)
(6) Mass Personnel Decontamination (MPD)
(7) Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS)

The CHRS program will provide a Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) packaging solution to safely return chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains to the Continental United States. The CHRT is a containment system that will protect personnel from the hazards associated with transporting human remains that are potentially contaminated with chemical, biological or radiological agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) without posing additional risk to the handlers or the environment in accordance with federal and international transportation standards.  The program addresses capability gaps identified within both the ConMit Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), dated March 2011, and the Mortuary Affairs ICD, dated October 2008.

Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS) is a contamination indicator and decontamination assurance technology. The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, aircraft, ships, crew-served weapons, and individual weapons that may have been exposed to traditional and non- traditional chemical contamination. DFoS CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce the logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination. This helps sustain a resilient force posture, making the Joint Force more adaptable against the uncertainty in a changing global strategic environment, an effort listed in the National Defense Strategy under building a more lethal force. It will consist of an indicator and an applicator, with three applicator configurations -- small-scale, tactical large scale, and reusable large scale applicators -- and three indicator formulations -- nerve training, nerve and blister indicators.

Starting in FY21, the DFoS CIDAS program is being broken into separate CIDAS Nerve and CIDAS Blister programs as the capabilities are intended to fulfill distinct solutions to meet Warfighter needs. The CIDAS Nerve program will address the visual disclosure of traditional and non-traditional nerve agents while the CIDAS Blister program addresses traditional blister agents, two separate threat scenarios that require different materiel solutions, modernizing a key capability to help build a more lethal force, as outlined in the National Defense Strategy.

DFoS CIDAS Blister is a contamination indicator and decontamination assurance technology. It will consist of a blister indicator and an applicator. The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, aircraft, ships, crew-served weapons, and individual weapons that may have been exposed to blister agent chemical contamination. DFoS CIDAS Blister is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce the logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of blister chemical agent on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.

The FAMS-S program is a new start program in FY21 and transitioning an improved sprayable decontaminate prototype technology being developed under the NTA Defense budget to a dedicated budget line in FY21.  FAMS-S will provide Special Operations Forces (SOF) and SOF Task Forces (SOTFs) a man-portable and mobile platform capable of rapidly decontaminating chemical and biological (CB) agents from the exterior of aircraft, helicopters, boats, vehicles, or support equipment to a level that is clean enough for re-use without having to wear CB protective equipment in order to quickly re-equip the force -- maximizing tactical flexibility and fighting strength while minimizing the logistical burden and the cost of conducting Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) and CB operations.  FAMS-S system variants envisioned are Large, Small, and Man-Portable configurations that will provide sufficient form factor to enable the SOF tactical forces to push decontamination capability as "far forward as possible" to execute decontamination "as soon as possible" following the tenants of decontamination.

The MDAP Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Initiative ensures weapon system programs at all Acquisition Category (ACAT) levels, as well as non-DoD agency programs such as those programs at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), meet their CBRN defense requirements.  This effort facilitates and coordinates the research, development, test and evaluation, procurement, delivery, and life cycle sustainment of affordable CBRN defense materiel solutions for each program's documented CBRN requirements.

The Mass Personnel Decontamination (MPD) program will develop an array of rugged and reliable best-of-breed hardware in a manageably sized, easy-to-erect, modular system that can be quickly tailored to different mass casualty events in order to support decontamination of ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients, and allow for the processing of contaminated human remains.  The program addresses capability gaps identified within the Consequence Management ICD dated 14 October 2010, the ConMit ICD dated 1 March 2011, and the Mortuary Affairs Operations ICD dated October 2008, modernizing a key capability under the National Defense Strategy?s line of effort of building a more lethal force.

The Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS) will provide the capability to conduct biological agent decontamination of the interior and exterior of the C-130 aircraft. The JBADS is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g., hot-humid air-blower), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination. It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated aircraft to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service, rebuilding military readiness and building a more lethal Joint Force as outlined in the National Defense Strategy. Future capability may address biological decontamination of vehicles and additional aircraft.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CONTAMINATED HUMAN REMAINS SYSTEM (CHRS)

The CHRS program will leverage previous efforts under a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) which have accelerated the CHRT project.  Additional minor design modifications, developmental and operational testing is part of the overall acquisition strategy.  Product development consists of the design and prototyping of a CHRT.  The contracting strategy will use the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Agreement (CWMD OTA) to procure prototype units, followed by Developmental Testing (DT).  Following DT completion, an In-Process Review will be conducted. A Logistics Demonstration (LD) and Operational Testing (OT) will be conducted.  An Operational Test Agency (OTA) Evaluation Report (OER) will be written, and technical reviews will be conducted, in preparation for a Milestone C/Full Rate Production decision.

DFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECONTAMINATION ASSURANCE SYSTEM (DFoS CIDAS)

The DFoS CIDAS program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy in consonance with user developed capability documents. Following MS A in 2011, the program office collaborated with external efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development (ATD) Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements. The DFoS CIDAS program determined the need for and initiated Government designed reusable and tactical large scale applicators to provide affordable solutions to meet specific User requirements. Following MS B in 2015, the program used full and open competition to award a performance based indefinite quantity contract with fixed price incentive successive target contract line items, with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) for nerve indicator and small scale applicator systems. The program will integrate the Contractor and Government designed indicator and applicators and conduct developmental and operational testing.

DFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECON ASSURANCE SPRAY BLISTER (DFoS CIDAS BLISTER)

The DFoS CIDAS Blister program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy. The program office coordinated with Science and Technology efforts to identify blister technologies that met Service requirements.  After further development, in 4QFY19 a sole-source performance based indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract was awarded to develop blister indicator and small scale applicator systems with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).  The program will leverage the contract to procure blister indicator kits and conduct test and evaluation events for the EMD phase in preparation for Milestone C.

FORWARD AREA MOBILITY SPRAY SYSTEM (FAMS-S)

The FAMS-S will be developed using an incremental acquisition strategy as an enabling technology for future application to include additional tactical and strategic platforms as determined by Special Operations Force (SOF).  FAMS-S will reduce technological risk by reviewing existing materials and technology as well as designs, configurations, and test data from legacy systems developed for decontamination applications, including the High Mobility Decontamination System (HMDS), the M26 Joint System Tactical Decontamination System - Small Scale (JSTDS-SS), and multiple commercial systems and components currently at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 and 9.

MAJOR DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAM (MDAP)

The MDAP program provides assistance to non-CBD programs with meeting and or optimizing their Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) survivability and force protection capabilities.  The MDAP also provides systems engineering analyses to develop CBRN specific operational and technical requirements, identifies performance gaps between existing materiel and technical requirements, develops cost and schedule estimates, conducts preliminary CBRN T&amp;E and logistics planning, develops CBRN defense architectures products, and performs trade space analyses for a number of non-CBD programs.

MASS PERSONNEL DECON (MPD)

The MPD program will develop the equipment, processes and procedures for DoD-affiliated personnel contaminated by chemical, biological, and radiological agents to achieve ambulatory and non-ambulatory throughput requirements as dictated by the needs of the Services, while considering various mission scenarios. As part of the acquisition strategy, key product developmental efforts will begin with the program achieving a MS A in 1QFY20, and includes efforts for the reduction of current MPD System costs by assessing existing Mass Casualty Decontamination (MCD) equipment and processes as well as new technology through the use of Requests
For Information (RFI's), Market Research Analyses and Technology Demonstrations. Data collected from prior equipment demonstrations as well as fieldings of commercial MCD systems in support of two validated Operational Needs Statements will inform the program as well. A competitive/sole source contract for prototyping and production units will be awarded, followed by Milestone B.  Results of Prototyping will inform developmental and operational testing effort, followed by Milestone C/Full Rate Production Approval. These efforts will additionally support the development of hazardous waste disposal and integration with a Contaminated Human Remains capability.

JOINT BIOLOGICAL AGENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JBADS)

The JBADS acquisition approach is to leverage information and technology from the JBADS Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) to support entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition cycle. Following testing, the JBADS will transition to Full Rate Production. The JBADS will utilize Commercial-off-the-Shelf components for the shelter, the decontamination delivery system, the environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components with the award of a competitive delivery order to produce, operate, and sustain the system. The program as a whole utilizes the evolutionary acquisition approach for future increments that may expand JBADS capabilities to include other platforms (aircraft and vehicles) as requirements dictate.  The Future Capabilities Analysis will conduct studies, analyses, and prototyping based on the current JBADS concept to improve its readiness to meet potential future requirements with minimal impact to the JBADS program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development Phase and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) for individual protection equipment, with the goal of providing equipment that allows the individual Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment with little or no degradation of his/her performance.  

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Special Purpose Unit Rapid Capability Development and Deployment (SPU RCDD)
(2) Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble (UIPE) Family of Systems (FoS)
(3) UIPE FoS General Purpose (GP) 
(4) Joint Service Aircrew Mask for Strategic Aircraft (JSAM SA)
(5) JSAM for Tactical Aircraft (JSAM TA)

SPU RCDD will facilitate rapid response to near-term and emergent chemical-biological defensive capability requirements from elements of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), select elements from across the Special Operations Force (SOF) Enterprise such as Combatant Commanders Response Forces (CRFs) and other Joint Force enabling units such as the 20th Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives Command.  SPU RCDD mitigates risk across the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) by creating a portfolio of operationally-relevant chemical and biological (CB) capabilities that can be quickly transitioned to needed elements and formations of the joint force, in whole or part, in response to the articulated, emergent capability needs of the geographic combatant commanders.  These objectives are met by the early transitioning of promising science and technologies (S&amp;T) from the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) among others; the focused conduct of combat evaluations and mission-oriented operational assessments to assess technological and mission suitability; and the active leveraging of existing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products along with novel redesign approaches to optimize existing solutions to new challenges supported by "buy-try-decide-acquire" acquisition strategies.  Projects being initiated or continued in FY21 include 1) modular and micro Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR) that will provide users an improved form-fit over the existing C420 PAPR configuration, be of smaller size and weight than the C420, and extend the filter and battery life beyond current capability so users may continue operating in a CB-contaminated environment unencumbered, and 2) CBRND protective equipment in response to new and emerging threats and opportunities.

UIPE FoS will develop a family of systems that will provide the broad spectrum of users with individual percutaneous protective equipment allowing the ability to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation in performance.  UIPE FoS will provide protection from operationally relevant traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.   

In FY21, UIPE FoS transitions to UIPE FoS General Purpose (GP), UIPE FoS Air and UIPE FoS Gloves.  In order to reflect the structure of the program, UIPE FoS will meet Mission Area needs, not individual Service needs.  The four Mission Areas are: Land, Air, Sea, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas have unique mission requirements that the UIPE FoS GP, Air and Gloves solutions will fulfill.

UIPE FoS GP will provide a family of systems that will give the Warfighter percutaneous protection from operationally relevant traditional, non-traditional, and advanced CBRN/Toxic Industrial Material (TIM) threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.  The family of systems is being developed based on agreed upon Service Mission Areas of which there are four: Land, Sea, Air, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas have unique mission requirements that the combined UIPE FoS solutions will fulfill. The overarching goal of each of the four Mission Areas is to minimize operational burden and provide improved form, fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.  The Tactical All-Hazards Threat Protective Ensemble (TATPE) will be a subset to the UIPE FoS GP and capitalize on the protection factor of commercial Level A with design modifications to align with the necessary operational requirements.  This suit serves as an additional tool in the arsenal until technology matures to the point of delivering a similar capability applied against the range of military operations in all environments under all conditions.

The JSAM SA and JSAM TA are Acquisition Category (ACAT) III programs developed to provide respiratory and ocular protection. The JSAM family is a lightweight Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protective mask for most United States Army (USA), Navy (USN), Air Force (USAF), and Marine Corps (USMC) rotary wing and fixed wing aircrew. All JSAM variants will be compatible with most Below-The-Neck (BTN) CB protection ensembles and existing Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE). They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly (except JSAM SA), and an intercom for ground communication. They will also provide flame protection, demist/emergency demist (except JSAM SA), and anti-drowning features. The goal of the JSAM programs is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain an aircrew respirator system that, in conjunction with BTN clothing ensembles.  These masks posture all aircrew to operate in an actual or perceived CB domain as directed in the 2018 National Defense Strategy.

The JSAM SA mask components will be optimized to minimize their impact on the wearer's performance and maximize its ability to interface with aircrew protective clothing.  JSAM SA will provide pressure breathing for altitude for aircraft that do not require pressure breathing for gravity.  JSAM SA will integrate with aircraft subsystems which include aviation life support equipment, aircrew flight equipment, aircraft seating, portable aircrew systems, communications systems, and aircraft oxygen systems.  The JSAM SA mask will provide individual respiratory, ocular, and percutaneous protection of chemical and biological warfare agents, and select Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) for USAF (E-3, E-8, C-135s, C-17, C-145, C-146, C-130s, C-5), Aeromedical personnel (C-130s, KC-10, U-18, KC-135, C-12s, KC-46), USN (P-8, E-6, C-40, C-12, C-20), USMC (C-9, C-12, C-20, UC-35), and USA (RC-7, C-12s, C-20, C-26, UC-35, C-37) strategic aircrew.

The JSAM TA will provide chemical biological protection for aircrew of high performance, ejection seat tactical aircraft.  The mask components will be optimized to minimize their impact on the wearer's performance and maximize its ability to interface with aircrew protective clothing. JSAM TA will be compatible with anti-G systems, providing Chemical, Biological, Radiological (CBR) protection without degrading protection against Gravity Induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) up to 9 Gz. JSAM TA will integrate with essential aircraft subsystems. The JSAM TA mask will provide individual respiratory, ocular, and percutaneous protection of chemical and biological warfare agents, and select Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) for USAF (F-22 A), USN (E-2 C/D, E/A-18G, F/A-18 A/C/E/F), and USMC (F/A-18 A/C/D, AV-8B, KC-130J and MV-22) tactical aircrew members.  The mask components will be optimized to minimize their impact on the wearer's performance and maximize its ability to interface with aircrew protective clothing.  JSAM TA will be compatible with anti-G systems, providing Chemical, Biological, Radiological (CBR) protection without degrading protection against Gravity Induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) up to 9 Gz.

Non-traditional projects will be executed for capabilities identified by Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), select elements from across the Special Operations Forces (SOF) Enterprise, and other Joint Force enabling units.  The SPU RCDD BA5 acquisition strategy for developmental efforts will allow rapid prototyping and testing of mission critical capabilities needed to enhance mission success.  The SPU RCDD BA7 modernization effort will use technical and functional evaluations of currently-fielded items to introduce and incorporate operationally-relevant system developments.  Both efforts will be accomplished by awarding an agreement through the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Authority (CWMD OTA) for the procurement of test assets.  An OTA contracting approach will be used to procure test prototypes and test articles of possible solutions.  The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  Procurement will be through either the OTAs, a Small Business Innovative Research contract, or a more traditional contracting vehicle.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE FAMILY OF SYSTEMS (UIPE FOS)

The UIPE FoS program will conduct market research through both Requests For Information (RFIs) and a call for White Papers through an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach. Candidate technologies will follow the same acquisition strategy employed for the suit: Early User Tests/Wear events and material and system level testing to identify available capabilities followed by a Trade Space Analysis to determine the most suitable glove(s). The UIPE FoS GP program will monitor S&amp;T activities for possible technology transitions.

In FY21, UIPE FoS transitions to UIPE FoS GP, UIPE FoS Air and UIPE FoS Gloves.   In order to reflect the structure of the program, UIPE FoS will meet Mission Area needs, not individual Service needs.  The four Mission Areas are: Land (i.e. GP), Air, Sea, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas has unique mission requirements that the UIPE FoS GP, Air and Gloves solutions will seek to fulfill.

UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTIVE ENSEMBLE GENERAL PURPOSE (UIPE FOS GP)

The UIPE FoS GP program utilized an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach to procure informational white papers during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, prototypes, and test articles of possible solutions.  The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  The OTA yielded several different prototypes that are undergoing material and system level testing and Early User Tests. Along with the OTA prototypes, the program is exploring the feasibility of a layered concept designed by the government and a manufacturing partner.

JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK STRATEGIC AIRCRAFT (JSAM SA)

The JSAM SA acquisition approach involves modifying the fielded M53 ground mask design in order to add Pressure Breathing for Altitude (PBA), up to 40,000 feet above sea-level, and middle ear equalization capabilities.  The JSAM SA mask is intended to be fielded to the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), and United States Army (USA).  The Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) contract was awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify and field a commercially available mask (M53).

The overall acquisition strategy is to produce and field the JSAM SA masks incrementally.  This approach allows the JSAM SA mask to be fielded to aircrew of the most applicable aircrafts in the shortest amount of time.  At the end of all increments, the Services will have achieved their Full Operating Capability (FOC).  The first increment will consist of fielding the JSAM SA mask to the USAF E-3 and USN P-8 aircrew.  Based on technical difficulty and mission need, the JSAM SA program will work with the Services to determine which aircraft will be addressed in subsequent increments.

The overall test strategy involves four major phases.  The first test phase consists of Design Verification Testing (DVT) which will evaluate developmental prototype masks prior to Critical Design Review (CDR).  The second test phase is Developmental Testing (DT) to support Milestone C/LRIP.  The third test phase is Operational Testing (OT) of assets to support Initial Operating Capability (IOC) fielding to USAF, USN, and USA aircrew.  The final test phase will consist of Integration and Airworthiness Certification (I&amp;AC) testing for all remaining aircraft.

The contract strategy consists of two sole-source contracts with Avon Protection Systems, the manufacturer of the fielded M53 mask.  The first contract, which was awarded on 31 July 2013, covers all activities during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to include all LRIP builds. The second contract, which was awarded on 4 January 2019 to Avon Protection Systems, will cover the activities during the Production and Deployment (PD) phase including all Full Rate Production (FRP) builds for the Services.

JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK TACTICAL AIRCRAFT (JSAM TA)

The JSAM TA acquisition approach involves modifying the USN/USMC fielded A/P22P-14A series respirator design to meet aircraft integration requirements.  The test strategy involves integrated testing (combined DT/OT) completed prior to MS C/FRP.  The contract strategy consists of two sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts with Cam Lock, Ltd., Aldershot Hampshire, United Kingdom.  The first contract, awarded September 2016, covers all activities during the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  The second contract awarded, September 2019, is a sole source FFP Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) that covers the activities during the Production and Deployment phase including Full Rate Production (FRP) builds.  The JSAM TA mask is intended to be fielded to the USN and USMC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP). Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Global Biosurveillance Portal (Global-BSP)
(2) Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Information Systems (CBRN IS)
(3) Joint Effects Model 2 (JEM 2)
(4) Joint Warning and Reporting Network 2 (JWARN 2), and
(5) Software Support Activity (SSA).

The Global-BSP is an unclassified, web-based computer and mobile application which facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the preparedness, detection, management, and mitigation of CBRN, as well as all hazard events. These capabilities enable the use of data visualization, real-time messaging and file sharing, and DoD and USG cooperation to expedite the timely identification and detection of CBRN events in order to minimize operational impacts to the local and global populations.

CBRN IS provides a collaborative Cloud hosted environment that allows users to collect and disseminate CBRN warning and reporting data, provide detailed CBRN hazard predictions, aid in decision support, and make relevant CBRN defense information available in near-real time. CBRN IS provides an environment that supports the implementation of Integrated Early Warning (IEW) capabilities that allow users to access netted sensor information, data fusion, disease modeling, biosurveillance data, source term estimation data, incident management tools, and planning and analysis capabilities. The CBRN IS enterprise makes CBRN decision aids readily accessible from any desktop through a web browser simplifying interoperability, reducing integration and deployment costs and increases cybersecurity protection.

The JEM 2 is a software application that provides the Department of Defense (DoD) with the only operationally tested and accredited tool to model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents. JEM 2 applies advanced physics using weather, terrain, and agent characteristics to predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM). JEM 2 displays hazard information on the Common Operational Picture (COP) and allows commanders to assess risk and take steps mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) on operational forces.

The JWARN 2 is a software application that provides the Department of Defense warning and reporting system that enables an immediate and integrated response to threats of contamination by WMD, CBRN and TIM incidents. JWARN 2 provides a digital display of CBRN reports on the COP, presented through Service provided Command and Control systems resident at all echelons of command. Commanders will be provided with enhanced situational battlespace awareness and support warfighter battle management and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.

The SSA provides for enterprise services in the areas of software development, network architecture, cybersecurity, technology transition, and information assurance standards and policies to support programs in conducting network architecture integration, technology transition insertion, and continued cybersecurity risk management framework efforts throughout the CBRND portfolio within the EMD/LRIP phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Global-BSP program is using the SOFCIDS (Special Operations Capabilities Integration and Development System) requirements approach and the JROC's "IT Box" acquisition construct which allows fielding of operational capabilities while continued R&amp;D matures technology required for follow-on versions.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple iterative fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event, and field products to the warfighter utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  The Global-BSP will achieve Full Operational Capability, complete resourced capabilities, and commence an orderly transition to sustainment in 2020.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

CBRN INFORMATION SYSTEMS

CBRN IS acquisition strategy utilizes a Family-of-Systems (FoS) approach to align multiple capabilities to the CBRN-IS architecture and operational environment. CBRN IS leverages the concepts of CBRN Hazard Awareness and Understanding and DISA Enterprise Services to integrate current CBRN capabilities, and other information and intelligence services, applications, and systems to provide increased situational awareness and decision support to commanders for CBRN defense. The strategy supports the implementation of integrated early warning capabilities by incorporating mature science and technology products and emerging technologies from existing advanced technology demonstrations (ATD) and experimental capability demonstrations (ECD). CBRN IS utilizes the Agile software development process to provide for the spiral development and fielding of modular capability packages.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

The JEM 2 acquisition strategy utilizes Agile software development practices, employing the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fieldings in lieu of a single fielding event.  As part of the strategy, an over-arching Milestone B and Build Decision for Requirements Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) were approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in 4QFY14.  Subsequent RDPs have been approved along with Capability Drops (CD) that define capability sets to be developed, tested, and fielded operationally.  JEM will prioritize and complete resourced CD's for RDP 1 and 2 to transition into sustainment.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 acquisition utilizes Agile software development practices, employing the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fieldings in lieu of a single fielding event.  As part of the strategy, an over-arching MS B and Build Decision for Requirements Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) were approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in 4QFY14.  Subsequent RDPs have been approved along with Capability Drops (CD) that define capability sets to be developed, tested, and fielded operationally.  JWARN will prioritize and complete resourced CD's for RDP 1 and 2 to transition into sustainment.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) of medical countermeasures, development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Botulinum Monoclonal Antibodies (BOT MAB)
(2) Chem Bio Incident Preparedness and Response - Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CBIPR - ADM)
(3) Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B)
(4) Medical Countermeasure Platform Technologies (MCMPT)
(5) Next Generation Diagnostic System 2 (NGDS 2)
(6) NGDS 2 Chemical Diagnostic (NGDS 2 CHEMDX)
(7) NGDS 2 Man Portable Diagnostic System (NGDS 2 MPDS)
(8) Defense Biological Products Assurance Program (DBPAP)
(9) Antiviral Therapeutics Program (AV TX)
(10) Joint Mobile Emerging Disease Intervention Clinical Capability (JMEDICC)

(14) Special Immunizations Program (VAC SIP)

Initiated by the Medical Countermeasure Platform Technologies (MCMPT), the goal of Botulinum Monoclonal Antibodies (BOT MAB)  advanced development effort is to counter exposure to BOT A &amp; B toxins. This capability is complementary to botulinum vaccine and therapeutics and will provide a continuum of protection against botulinum toxins.  BoNT Advanced Development and Manufacturing of Antibody Technology (ADAMANT) leverages the advanced platform technology developed within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility. Efforts will focus on the evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for the animal rule, as well as the preparation for and execution of consistency lots to support phase 2/3 clinical trials. A Biologics License Application (BLA) will be submitted to the FDA including all clinical, non-clinical and manufacturing data. The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.  

The capability building effort at the DoD ADM will establish and enhance proven biopharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing technologies to accelerate the delivery of medical countermeasures as part of a medical integrated layered defense.  The return on investment is an increased level of preparedness and responsiveness to counter current and emerging chemical and biological threats. By establishing and enhancing proven enabling technologies, the DoD ADM will accelerate development of MCMs at all stages of development, enhance preparedness for existing threats, and accelerate response to emerging threats.  MCMs impacted by these efforts include: Vaccines for Viral Agents, Vaccines for Bacterial Agents and Toxins, Monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody conjugates for therapeutic and prophylactic use across all agent classes, and Adjuvants.  Funds to support the state of readiness were previously provided through individual product development and manufacturing funding lines.  

The CMDR-B program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against MDR bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. The candidate drug was approved by  the FDA in Oct 18 for Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) that was required as part of the acquisition strategy for the antibiotic repurposing program from S&amp;T to advanced development. 

MCMPT is establishing enabling technologies and pre positioning platform systems at the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the medical countermeasure (MCM) development risks. Efforts will center on leveraging the ADM's facility and developing robust manufacturing processes. MCMPT will leverage platform technologies to streamline and accelerate the MCM delivery to the Force by reducing developmental risk. A subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats. Through the Advanced Development and Manufacturing Antibody Technologies (ADAMANT) and Rapid Response platforms, MCMPT will deliver an enduring capability from which future candidates can be manufactured. The Agile Medical Paradigm (AMP) is the CBDP's strategic framework to accelerate the delivery of MCMs. To achieve this goal the DOD is establishing a medical countermeasures platform technology (MCMPT) capability. 

The NGDS is a family of systems providing increments of diagnostic capabilities over time that address varied CBR threats across the different echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBR threat and infectious disease identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 improves diagnostic capabilities in deployable and laboratory-based combat health support units. NGDS Increment 1 offers improved operational suitability and affordability over legacy systems by developing FDA cleared BWA and infectious disease IVD assays on an existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  NGDS 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.  NGDS 2 will provide additional capability for diagnosis of CBR-induced diseases, suitable for use in far forward environments, by developing lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use instruments and test kits.  In FY21, NGDS 2 has been broken out into two separate programs; NGDS 2 MPDS Program and NGDS 2 CHEMDX Program.  NGDS 2 MPDS will complement NGDS Increment 1 by providing a lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use diagnostic capability to end-users in non-laboratory, far-forward environments.  NGDS 2 CHEMDX will provide a lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use diagnostic capability to end-users in non-laboratory, far-forward environments.  

The DBPAP strategy establishes a core research and development capability by developing biological threat agent reference materials (strains, antigens, antibodies and nucleic acids) and detection/diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection.  These reagents/assays are leveraged across multiple programs to meet the requirements of the Warfighter and Joint biological defense systems and support the biological defense community.  Through the Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) initiative, the DBPAP will use a systematic approach to the introduction of new materials and information into MCM development. This includes advanced platform technologies within the DoD's ADM facility.

The AV TX will develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral therapeutics for the warfighter.  Initial drug product will be developed targeting Ebola Virus Disease with Marburg and Sudan to follow for approval of a PanFilo therapeutic to the warfighter. Development of models to provide a therapeutic for alphavirus are being developed through JSTO Research &amp; Development. Other pathogens on the biological warfare threat lists, including viruses of interest from Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae, are targets of future interest. Developed antiviral therapeutics will be employed after suspected or confirmed exposure to the relevant threat agents and AV TX MCMs will ameliorate the effect of threat agents to the warfighter.  In the event of a natural occurring outbreak, antiviral therapeutics can be provided to ensure freedom of operation. 

The JMEDICC is a collaboration between United States and Ugandan research and outbreak response entities intended to enable clinical trials for filovirus (Ebola and Marburg) therapeutics during an outbreak. The JMEDICC effort provides a platform of advanced supportive care, scientific rigor, laboratory and logistical capacity, mobility, and rapid response to test new therapeutics or MCM in a filovirus outbreak setting. The JMEDICC effort is a project whose resulting capability offers a mechanism to greatly accelerate the development of life-saving products for future outbreaks. The performer received approval of an emergency access protocol for the use of the Remdesivir drug in the country of Uganda. JMEDICC effort was funded by the AV TX Program in FY19.

The DoD provides for the development of vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures are urgently needed to negate the threat of these BW agents.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A/B and Plague vaccines.  Efforts to be conducted during the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase include the development of large scale manufacturing process and validation of that process, nonclinical studies, demonstration of manufacturing consistency, and expanded clinical human safety studies.  The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a BLA to the FDA for product licensure.  To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's "Animal Rule".  The Recombinant Botulinum A/B and Plague vaccine programs are no longer seeking FDA licensure.  

IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the SIP conducting research on these diseases. DoD has the mission to maintain Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and stability testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The goal of the BOT MABs advanced development effort is to counter exposure to BOT A &amp; B toxins. A contract will be awarded to a prime performer responsible for executing efforts in the EMD phase to focus on the evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the animal rule, as well as the preparation for, and execution of, consistency lots to support phase 2/3 clinical trials. A Biologics License Application (BLA) will be submitted to the FDA including all non-clinical, clinical and manufacturing data. The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.

CHEM BIO INCIDENT PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE - ADM

A contract was awarded to Ology Bioservices on 20 March 2013 (then Nanotherapeutics, Inc.) to establish a Department of Defense (DoD) ADM Facility to rapidly develop, approve (through FDA approval), and manufacture MCMs.  The contract was structured to be executed in two (2) phases:

Phase 1-Establish, commission and validate (facility(ies)/ equipment) for two (2) advanced development and manufacturing suites that use agile, flexible (single use, disposable), modular and multi-product technologies for MCM advanced development and manufacturing. Both suites must meet Biological Safety Level-3 (BSL-3) standards.  Phase 1 was completed on 31 March 2017.

Phase 2-Support and maintain that capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (under the animal rule as applicable) and manufacturing and assist in training personnel in its use. This includes transition and integration of new technologies, from Pre-Investigational New Drug Application phase with readiness to support simultaneous operations, through FDA licensure.  The first sustainment option (POP 2 years) was completed in 2QFY19; the subsequent sustainment option began thereafter and is scheduled for completion in 4QFY20, but can be extended until 2QFY21 if needed.

COUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)

The CMDR-B program develops MCMs for Service members for protection against MDR bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. The candidate is a transitional product from S&amp;T that showed efficacy against plague, anthrax, and other BW agents. The regulatory approach of the program is to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule. The program will conduct non-human primate studies to confirm efficacy.  The performer will develop and submit an IFC package to FDA for emergency use to support the warfighter preparedness against MDR. The performer will submit Supplemental New Drug Application for the therapeutic during the EMD Phase.  In FY18 PK study on non-human primates was completed for the plague indication and results were analyzed against threat indication. Continued coordination with FDA for supplemental indication of anthrax based on threat level to the warfighter.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review reduced this program for higher priorities.

MCM PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES (MCMPT)

The goal of the MCMPT is to rapidly counter a broad-spectrum of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  Efforts will focus on establishing advanced platform technologies within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and evaluating that capability through nonclinical and clinical testing. A subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats. Once established, future programs will be able to leverage these platforms for the development of future medical countermeasures.  It is anticipated that these efforts will leverage the Other Transactions Authority (OTA) through the medical OTA consortium.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS 1 program was a MS A to MS C - acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 is replacing the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. NGDS 1 Full Rate Production was approved in Aug 2018.

NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 continued the technology maturation and risk reduction of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY18 and transitioned to engineering and manufacturing development phase in FY19.  NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a chemical diagnostic capability in FY18. Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements. Development efforts are cost-plus awards using Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings. NGDS 2 is broken out into NGDS 2 CHEMDx and NGDS 2 MPDS starting in FY21.

NEXT GEN DIAG 2 CHEMICAL DIAGNOSTICS (NGDS 2 CHEMDX)

NGDS Increment 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 CHEMDX will provide a lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use diagnostic capability against chemical threat agents to end-users in non-laboratory, far-forward environments.  NGDS 2 CHEMDX initiated prototyping in FY18 and will conclude prototyping in FY21. NGDS 2 CHEMDX is using an Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreement to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings. NGDS 2 CHEMDX program is broken out from the NGDS Increment 2 program starting in FY21.

NEXT GEN DIAG 2 MAN PORTABLE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM (NGDS 2 MPDS)

NGDS Increment 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 Man Portable Diagnostic System (MPDS) will complement NGDS Increment 1 by providing a lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use diagnostic capability to end-users in non-laboratory, far-forward environments.  NGDS 2 MPDS concluded prototyping in FY19 and is continuing with engineering and manufacturing development. MPDS is using Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings. The NGDS 2 MPDS program is broken out from the NGDS Increment 2 program starting in FY21.

DEFENSE BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS ASSURANCE PROGRAM (DBPAP)

The Defense Biological Products Assurance Program's (DBPAP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent reference materials (antigens, nucleic acids, and antibodies) as well as detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be used across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy includes a formal, validated advanced development process for transitioning new assays into production and subsequent integration with the appropriate detection/diagnostic platform.

ANTI-VIRAL THERAPEUTICS (AV TX)

The Anti-viral Therapeutics program acquisition strategy supports the development of multiple therapeutics through the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase against the Ebola (Zaire), Marburg and Sudan bio warfare threats. The initial therapeutic candidate is for the Ebola Zaire that completed a Milestone B decision review in 2QFY19.  The overall regulatory approach of the program remains to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule that was approved as the path, by the FDA in 1QFY19. The program completed a Natural History study as well as a dose ranging study that are part of the pivotal animal studies for FDA approval planned. There are 3 more pivotal animal studies for FDA approval. The acquisition strategy for Marburg and Sudan indications will have the performer submitting amended New Drug applications for the therapeutics during the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase.

JOINT MOBILE EMERGING DISEASE INTERVENTION CLINICAL CAPABILITY (JMEDICC)

The Joint Mobile Emerging Disease Intervention Clinical Capability (JMEDICC) is a collaboration between United States and Ugandan research and outbreak response entities. It currently is a joint effort with The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and The Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) to enable clinical trials for filovirus (i.e., Ebola and Marburg) therapeutics during an outbreak.  JMEDICC effort was funded by the Antiviral Therapeutics (AV TX) Program (MB5) in FY19.  A new funding line was added in FY20 to support this effort.  The JMEDICC effort is currently focused on filovirus, but is an adaptable capability that can incorporate multiple different medical countermeasures (MCM) in parallel and accommodate multiple site activities. This will maximize JMEDICC's current response capability and infrastructure by expanding as the endemic situation warrants.  A cost sharing plan is currently being explored with other government and nongovernment agencies to determine interest and relevance levels.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review reduced this program for higher priorities.

BOTULINUM VACCINE (VAC BOT)

The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) will function as the FDA regulatory sponsor and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  The current budget supports development through FDA licensure of a recombinant bivalent (A and B) botulinum vaccine.  Other serotypes will be developed through an evolutionary approach, as funding becomes available.  The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data.  The evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the Animal Rule has been completed.  The remaining efforts to be conducted during the EMD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition strategy for prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and diagnostic medical devices for the protection, treatment, detection, and medical management of chemical warfare agent exposures.  This project provides for the research and development of safety studies, manufacturing scale-up, process validation, drug interaction, performance test, and submission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug licensure application(s).

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS),
(2) Alternative Autoinjector Manufacturer Capability (AUTOINJ),
(3) Bioscavenger (BSCAV-P),
(4) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS),
(5) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System Centrally Acting (INATS CA), and
(6) Rapid Opioid Countermeasure System (ROCS)

AAS consists of Midazolam in an autoinjector for treatment of nerve agent induced seizures.  Midazolam, injected intramuscularly, will treat traditional nerve agent and non-traditional agent-induced seizures and prevent subsequent neurological damage.  Midazolam is more water-soluble than diazepam (the currently fielded medication to control nerve agent-induced seizures) and terminates nerve agent-induced seizures more quickly than diazepam.  AAS will not eliminate the need for other protective and therapeutic systems.

AUTOINJ consists of investigating an FDA approved alternative source(s), beyond the single current Department of Defense (DoD) source, for autoinjectors that deliver DoD nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the warfighter; mitigates capability fielding and operational readiness risks.  This resulted from the manufacturing and quality issues for the fielded Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA) product, the oxime (2-PAM) and atropine in a dual chambered autoinjector.  This program augments legacy autoinjectors, ATNAA, 2-PAM, and CANA by providing alternative commercial sources which include Dual Drug Delivery Device (D4), the atropine autoinjector, and anti-convulsant autoinjector.

BSCAV-P was intended to be a new capability for use as a prophylaxis against nerve agents.  This program is pursuing closeout activities during FY19 and FY20.

INATS Pre-Breakout advanced development in FY19 and FY20 provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  The development includes insertion of a CA anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.  The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA).

INATS CA advanced development in FY21 provides a centrally-acting anticholinergic agent to increase survivability and decrease morbidity after exposure to toxic nerve agent threats.  Scopolamine was selected for development after an extensive analysis of alternatives and review of data by the Science and Technology community.  Added to the currently fielded system, the INATS CA program will improve overall medical outcomes and will be utilized as both a vial for use at definitive care and a stand-alone auto-injector for use in the field.  

ROCS is specifically supporting the discovery, characterization, development, and fielding of FDA-approved therapeutic MCMs to protect the Joint Service warfighter against operational exposures to the opioid class of pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), a high priority.  The first increment of the ROCS program will develop a naloxone autoinjector as a rescue treatment that will counteract the adverse effects from exposure to opioids.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ADVANCED ANTICONVULSANT SYSTEM (AAS)

The Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS), consists of Midazolam in an autoinjector for treatment of seizures, to include those caused by nerve agent.  A contractor shall be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and/or licenses. The Contractor will need to initiate and complete studies that comply with new FDA requirements for manufacturing and quality for autoinjector products, ultimately leading to FDA approval. Upon FDA approval, sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Full Operational Capability (FOC) will be purchased. Subsequent purchases for product sustainment will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency. Post marketing commitments and requirements are anticipated as a result of the FDA approval and will be the responsibility of the contractor and the government

ALTERNATE AUTOINJECTOR MANUFACTURER CAPABILITY (AUTOINJ)

The Alternative Autoinjector Manufacturer Capability (AUTOINJ) will identify an alternative source(s) to develop and provide required FDA-approved autoinjector-delivered nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the DoD.  Currently, a single DoD source provides all of these capabilities.  

The AUTOINJ effort leverages novel technologies and industrial base expansion in order to develop the autoinjector products.  AUTOINJ uses contracts and Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs) in which the performer shall be responsible for conducting development and testing activities consistent with current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and/or licenses. Upon FDA approval, purchases for product sustainment will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency. 

AUTOINJ (MC7) Post marketing commitments and requirements are anticipated as a result of the FDA approval and will be the responsibility of the contractor and the government.

BIOSCAVENGER (BSCAV)

The Bioscavenger program employed a serial evaluation of candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) phase, culminating in a down-select decision.  The Bioscavenger program then issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  During the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, the program continued to meet its performance objectives and produced a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) drug product for use in further development. 

The program will end activities in FY20.  In FY19, the program initiated termination of acquisition activities and program close out, will be completed in FY20.  The program will continue to work with the Joint Science &amp; Technology Office in their efforts to advance potential candidates and will monitor Health and Human Service programs, international programs, and the commercial sector for potential materiel solutions for this capability gap.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

The INATS (MC4) program concludes as INATS in FY19. 

In the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) phase, close collaborations will occur with the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies and clinical safety studies.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, the Government will engage with commercial partner(s) to ensure that INATS CA development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities, resulting in only the INATS CA component being pursued.

The INATS (MC7) line initiates in FY20 and transitions to INATS CA (MC7) in FY21.  INATS (MC7) will support the modernization of Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP) using contract actions to extend operational shelf-life and generate data to expand storage temperature conditions.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT CENTRALLY ACTING (INATS CA)

(MC5) In the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) phase, close collaborations will occur with the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies and clinical safety studies. In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, the Government will engage with commercial partner(s) to ensure that development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.

RAPID OPIOID COUNTERMEASURE SYSTEM (ROCS)

Rapid Opioid Countermeasure System (ROCS) is a Joint ACAT III Medical Countermeasure (MCM) Middle Tier acquisition Program of Record (POR) in the Prototype Phase of development. The ROCS program will use existing naloxone autoinjector capabilities identified from focused Market Research. ROCS is a Middle Tier acquisition program. The development of the autoinjector will be conducted under Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement. Once FDA approval has been granted the program will transition from Rapid Prototyping to Rapid Fielding or a traditional production and fielding pathway.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The CBMAI funding (BA4-5) is required to provide existing and future test fixtures and methodology to support advanced development test and evaluation intended to meet a changing threat regardless of the test site/location. These activities support current PoRs (e.g., UIPE FoS, NBCRV SSU, etc.) as well as future PoRs such as interdependent contamination mitigation (C3PO, WADS, SEDS), future protective mask programs (i.e., M50 Tech Refresh), remote detection (air to ground/C-SIRP) and integrated early warning (IEW).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The projects in this program element (PE) support Joint Doctrine and Training, sustains the technical test capability at West Desert Test Center (WDTC), sustains the core Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical Biological (CB) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory infrastructure, provides for program and financial management support, and supports the Joint Concepts, Studies, and Analysis program.

Individual projects include:
- Joint Doctrine and Training Support (DT6): development of Joint Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for developing CB defense systems.  This project also supports CB modeling and simulation to support the Warfighter.

- Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) (DW6): operating support to WDTC and BioTesting Division (Chemical Biological Center) for the required institutional test operating costs (e.g. institutional civilian and contractor labor; repair and maintenance of test instrumentation, equipment, and facilities; and replacement of test equipment).

- Laboratory Support (LS6): operating support for sustainment and modernization efforts for surety laboratory infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance DoD infrastructure capabilities to counter an expanding threat space, exploit advances in technology; and develop and transition CB defense equipment and countermeasures to the Warfighter.

- Management Support (MS6): management support for the DoD Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to allow program overview and integration of overall medical and non-medical programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)), through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical Biological Defense (DASD(CBD)).

- Joint Concept Development (O49): plan, conduct, evaluate, and report on Joint tests (for other than developmental hardware) and accomplishment of operational research assessments in support of requirements received from the Services and the Combatant Commanders for already fielded equipment and systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides the technical and operational capability for testing Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological (CB) and Non Traditional Agent (NTA) defense materiel, equipment, and systems from concept through production to include associated special operations Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Development (TTPD) activities at West Desert Test Center (WDTC), and the BioTesting Division (BTD) of the Chemical and Biological Center (CBC), both part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) located at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  Project provides overhead (institutional) funding required to operate WDTC and BTD-CBC in compliance with Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY03 (Public Law 107-314 - December 2002).

WDTC and BTD-CBC are the reliance centers for all DoD CB defense testing and provide the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) test facility.  Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the OSD Chemical and Biological Defense Program in accordance with Program Budget Decision 250 (1996).

WDTC and BTD-CBC use state-of-the-art chemical and life-sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, equipment, and non-materiel CB defense solutions while maintaining safety, security, and surety of chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides test ranges, to include fully instrumented outdoor ranges, for TTPD activities and testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents to ensure reliable and repeatable data are generated to support acquisition decisions of CB defense equipment.

The Secretary of the Army has been directed to conduct additional research addressing existing gaps in scientific knowledge encompassing the Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Program.  The transition of the BTD to CBC will enable the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program to meet end to end enterprise tracking, reporting, and auditability requirements within an approved Governance, Risks, and Compliance framework.  The laboratory commanders and directors are best able to identify potential risk through the use of local risk assessments and are responsible to promote cultures of safety and responsibility.  Direct liaison with and oversight by the Executive Agent Responsible Officer will ensure laboratory directors or the MRTFB commander are empowered and supported in their operational environment.  The ultimate responsibility for the safe and secure receipt, storage, handling, shipment and transfer of BSAT resides with the laboratory director or the MRTFB commander in accordance with Army, Navy, Air Force, and Federal policies and regulations.  The implementation of a structured BSAT Biosafety Program includes clear standards and procedures, policy and regulations, peer review, quality control, accountability and oversight, adequate resources and infrastructure, and continuous process improvement.  Through these means employees and members of the public are protected against the hazards associated with BSAT.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

JACKS provides the CBRN community a centralized authoritative and comprehensive source of CBRN products information through a single database interface.

This project also supports the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (CBRND) Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive, who is responsible for the planning, balancing, and oversight of test infrastructure and test technology requirements to support Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of DoD CBRND systems, as outlined in the RDA Plan.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive oversees the Enterprise processes to develop and sustain standardized T&amp;E methodologies and validated instrumentation and infrastructure to ensure the adequacy of test for CBRND systems in alignment with acquisition milestones and associated decision points.  The Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program supports T&amp;E Early Involvement; test threat planning; T&amp;E studies; and T&amp;E standards planning and development to support CBRND testing for all Services to include medical T&amp;E efforts.  

The CBRND T&amp;E Executive directly supports OSD T&amp;E oversight of acquisition programs and provides the mechanism for early T&amp;E involvement in the acquisition process.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive provides the T&amp;E infrastructure investment strategy and coordinates investment planning and T&amp;E capabilities validation among the Joint Service Community to ensure that program needs are met.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive oversees the T&amp;E processes to ensure end to end feedback loops to support to the Warfighter.

The project includes programming support for the Joint Service CB Information System (JSCBIS) which serves as a budgetary and informational database for the DoD CBDP.  JSCBIS will transition to the modernized system, the Joint Integrated CBRN Analytic Platform (JICAP).  Also included within the project is financial management services to include fund distribution, execution reporting, and fiscal financial statements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Program is a Congressionally mandated program established to increase the participation of small business in federal research and development (R&amp;D).  Currently, each participating Government agency must reserve 2.5% of its extramural R&amp;D for SBIR awards to competing small businesses.  The goal of the SBIR Program is to invest in the innovative capabilities of the small business community to help meet Government R&amp;D objectives while allowing small companies to develop technologies and products which they can then commercialize through sales back to the Government or in the private sector.

The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program like SBIR, is a Government-wide program, mandated by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, Public Law (PL) 102-564.  STTR was established in FY94 as a three-year pilot program.  In early 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a comprehensive review of the Government-wide STTR Program to determine the effectiveness of the pilot program.  Upon review of the GAO report, Congress voted to reauthorize the STTR Program to the year 2000, consistent with the authorization period for the SBIR Program.

STTR was established as a companion program to the SBIR Program and is executed in essentially the same manner; however, there are several distinct differences.  The STTR Program provides a mechanism for participation by university, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and other non-profit research institutions.  Specifically, the STTR Program is designed to provide an incentive for small companies and research at academic institutions and non-profit research and development institutions to work together to move emerging technical ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace to foster high-tech economic development and to advance U.S. economic competitiveness.  Each STTR proposal must be submitted by a team which includes a small business (as the prime contractor for contracting purposes) and at least one research institution, which have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for the purposes of the STTR effort.  Furthermore, the project must be divided up such that the small business performs at least 40% of the work and the research institution(s) performs at least 30% of the work.  The remainder of the work may be performed by either party or a third party.  The budget is separate from the SBIR budget and is significantly smaller (0.15% of the extramural R&amp;D budget vs. 2.5% for the SBIR Program).

The Department of Defense (DoD) has consolidated management and oversight of the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) into a single office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The Army was designated as the Executive Agent for coordination and integration of the CBDP.  The executive agent for the SBIR/STTR portion of the program is the Army Research Office-Washington.

The overall objective of the CBD SBIR/STTR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a biological or chemical environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include chemical and biological detection; information assessment, which includes identification, modeling, and intelligence; contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project supports technology upgrade and refresh of fielded dismounted reconnaissance and detection systems that minimize chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contamination and prevent further cross-contamination during operations.
 
Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Expeditionary Analytic Modernization (EXANA MOD)
(2) Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) 
(3) Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) Solid Liquid Adapter (SLA)

The EXANA MOD effort supports the evaluation of analytical components for technical refreshment and upgrades of key components of the analytical laboratory systems that have become obsolete, or are no longer being supported by the manufacturer. This allows the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) and Analytical Laboratory System (ALS) Modification (MOD) users to maintain their operational capability and operational effectiveness.

The CBRN DRS provides the technology upgrade and refresh effort for the CBRN DRS system supporting Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, CBRN Sensitive Site Assessment, and CBRN Sensitive Site Exploitation missions which enables more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow for the Warfighter. Warfighters will use the portable, commercial and Government off-the-shelf equipment provided to detect, identify, sample, decontaminate, mark, and report CBRN hazards and emerging threats.  This technology upgrade and refresh effort for the CBRN DRS addresses and mitigates technology/equipment obsolescence and technology insertion.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.  Starting in FY21, the System Enhancement Package (SEP) effort will identify and test capability to meet updated and new user requirements to support threats and capability gaps in sensitive site exploitation.  System enhancement packages will be identified and incorporated into the CBRN DRS as engineering change proposals to the base kit. SEP v1 will provide an Improved Biological Detection Set (IBDS).  SEP v2 will provide an Improved Protection and Power Set (IPPS). SEP v3 will provide an Improved Chemical Detection Kit.  SEP v4 will provide a kit of situational awareness/decision support enhancements called the CBRN Dismounted Tactical Awareness Kit (CBRN DTAK).  CBRN DRS will be produced at government production facilities.  The SEP packages will be configured, produced, and fielded in accordance with priorities and needs of the Services. 

The JCAD is a miniaturized, rugged, and portable point chemical agent detector that automatically and simultaneously detects, identifies, &amp; alerts the presence of nerve, blister, &amp; blood chemical warfare agents. M4 achieved Full Rate Production (FRP) in Sep 08 and finished in FY10.  Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) authorized production cut-in of the M4A1 in FY11.  Solid Liquid Adapter (SLA) development kit is an interim capability using M4A1 as base detector. The JCAD-SLA funding in FY20 will provide test support costs to Other Government Agencies (OGA's) (Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC), Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Agency (MCOTEA), Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)), operational testing, first article testing, Pressure Breathing for Altitude (PBA) testing with Chemical Biological Center (CBC), logistics demonstration, and completion of testing from FY19.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) and the Analytical Laboratory System (ALS) Modification (MOD) program's objective is to address critical analytical equipment obsolescence (Analytical Suite) and system functionality issues for the National Guard Bureau's (NGB) Civil Support Teams. This includes market survey, down select, testing, integration, and update of Technical Data Package and logistical documentation. It is anticipated that Capability Development Document (CDD) updates will be finalized for the CALS Theater Validation Integrated System (TV IS) and Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Set (FC ACS) variants in FY20. As such, this program will follow continue to follow the most up-to-date requirement documentation for CALS and ALS MOD.

CBRN DISMOUNTED RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEMS

The Chemical Biological Radiological Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a GOTS/COTS non-developmental item (NDI) single step acquisition approach to a full capability.  This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, well-managed acquisition program.  Current efforts focus on maintaining baseline capabilities through obsolescence management and technology insertions.  In order to meet the demands of the National Defense Strategy (NDS) to Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction, units equipped with the CBRN DRS must be able to both assess CBRN hazards and exploit them.  Advancing threats and current capability gaps in sensitive site exploitation capability require a System Enhancement Package (SEP) to the baseline CBRN DRS.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review reduced this program for higher priorities.

JOINT CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (JCAD)

The JCAD SLA kit will be an Additional Authorized List (AAL) item to the M4A1 JCAD. The JCAD SLA attaches to the JCAD and expands existing JCAD capability to detect NTAs, PBAs (opioids and fentanyls), and explosives. The JCAD SLA acquisition strategy will award a FFP / CPFF IDIQ to produce the required JCAD SLA quantities based on service requirements with initial fielding in fourth quarter FY20 to SOCOM.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for technology upgrade and refresh of fielded Collective Protection (CP) equipment and systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in spaces safe from the effects of chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contamination.

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP)
(2) Modernization Protection Collective Protection (MODPROT CP) 

JECP provides the Joint Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  Modernization and improvement efforts addressed include development of a field leakage test capability that allows Warfighters to validate the integrity of JECP and other fielded CP systems; integration of a newly developed filtration material into existing M98 Gas Particulate Filter Sets to provide the Warfighter with improved protection against Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), while maintaining current performance characteristics against Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and meeting military standards; development of a CP kit for non-CP Environmental Control Units (ECUs) and improvement on the current tent liner restraint systems.

Starting in FY21, JECP BA7 funding and efforts are transitioning under the MODPROT CP budget line.

MODPROT CP provides upgrades, improvements and modernizations to fielded Collective Protection Systems such as Mobile ColPro Systems, Fixed Site ColPro Systems, Transportable ColPro Systems, Modular CP Equipment Systems, and Collectively Protected Field Hospitals (CPFH).  Efforts addressed include the M98 filter set life extension, modernization of the shipboard and fixed facility obsolete collective protection M98 filter housings and system controls, identification and testing of replacements for obsolete M93 and M59 Gas Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU) components used in numerous hard shelter systems. MODPROT CP also addresses obsolescence issues in test quality standards for gas filters, modernizes shipboard &amp; fixed facility collective protection, M48 filters, and collective protection training, and evaluates reduced airflow on Chem Bio Radiological (CBR) filters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JOINT EXPEDITIONARY COLLECTIVE PROTECTION (JECP)

JECP Family of Systems (FoS) (Phase 1 and Phase 2) involves multiple contract types throughout the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Production and Deployment Phases of the program. Having achieved a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for Phase 1 Systems in December 2016, the program exercised Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) production options in FY17 &amp; FY18 through the now expired contract with Leidos in support of Initial Operational Capability (IOC). A competitive build-to print follow-on production delivery order contract was awarded June 2019 to Production Products Manufacturing and will support the remaining production of Phase 1 Systems to meet Full Operational Capability (FOC). Phase 2 systems will be developed as engineering changes to the Phase 1 systems under a separate competitive delivery order awarded March 2019 to Leidos and undergo limited developmental and operational testing in pursuit of a FRP decision. Production options are included in the delivery order to meet FOC for Phase 2 systems. Additionally, BA7 funding will develop incremental improvements to fielded JECP FoS. BA7 efforts include a range of improvements intended to enhance filtration protection, provide a field leakage test capability and update various fielded Environmental Control Unit (ECU) interface types for use with collective protection. These efforts involve development of designs and prototyping under the Other Transaction Authority (OTA) through the Countering Weapons Mass Destruction (CWMD) Consortium contract as well as exploitation of commercial off-the-shelf items.

MODERNIZATION PROTECTION (MODPROT)

In FY21, MODPROT will be split into three programs to fund three separate Modernization Efforts:  Modernization Protection Collective Protection (MODPROT CP), Modernization Protection Decontamination (MODPROT DE), and Modernization Protection Individual Protection (MODPROT IP).  The original MODPROT acquisition strategies will continue to be followed after the transition occurs in FY21.

Modernization Collective Protection (MODPROT CP) leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded collective protection systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MODERNIZATION PROTECTION (MODPROT)

In FY21, MODPROT will be split into three programs to fund three separate Modernization Efforts:  Modernization Protection Collective Protection (MODPROT CP), Modernization Protection Decontamination (MODPROT DE), and Modernization Protection Individual Protection (MODPROT IP).  The original MODPROT acquisition strategies will continue to be followed after the transition occurs in FY21.

Modernization Collective Protection (MODPROT CP) leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded collective protection systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project supports technology refresh of fielded individual protective equipment which enable the warfighter to operate in a contaminated CBR environment with little or no degradation to his/her performance.  

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Modernization Protection Individual Protection (MODPROT IP) 
(2) Special Purpose Unit Rapid Capability Development and Deployment (SPU RCDD) 
(3) Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM)

MODPROT IP addresses obsolescence issues with Individual Protective equipment and the need to modernize the Joint Services fielded chemical and biological protection with capabilities meeting or exceeding the Services requirements.  MODPROT IP will conduct qualification testing on the protective glove, Joint Service Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) Block 2 Glove Upgrade non- Flame Resistant (JB2GU nFR), to determine if storage life may be extended to 20 years from the Date of Manufacture.  MODPROT IP will also conduct modernization efforts and reverse engineering of maintenance and repair procedures for the Joint Services Mask Leakage Tester (JSMLT).  MODPROT IP will also provide mask and filter system upgrades and modernization of field protection systems to enhance respiratory and ocular protection.  

The SPU RCDD will facilitate rapid response to near-term and emergent chemical-biological (CB) defensive capability requirements from elements of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), select elements from across the Special Operations Forces (SOF) Enterprise and other Joint Force enabling units.  SPU RCDD mitigates risk across the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) by creating a portfolio of operationally-relevant chemical and biological (CB) capabilities that can quickly transition to needed elements and formations of the joint force, in part or in whole, in response to the emergent capability needs of the geographic combatant commanders.  These objectives are met by the early transitioning of promising science and technologies (S&amp;T), the focused conduct of combat evaluations and mission-oriented operational assessments to assess technological and mission suitability, and the active leveraging of existing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products along with novel redesign approaches to modernize and optimize existing solutions to new challenges supported by "buy-try-decide-acquire" acquisition strategies.  SPU RCDD will provide enhanced chemical, biological, radiological, and, nuclear (CBRN) detect and protect capabilities against new and emerging CBRN threats through modernized and technologically-mature component and system enhancements to currently fielded host platforms and legacy systems, thereby extending service life, off-setting costs to initiate a new acquisition program, and putting critical CBRN capabilities in the hands of warfighters by faster acceleration through the acquisition process.  

JSGPM provides for respiratory and ocular protection modernization and enhancements for Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) protection and operational performance in air purifying, powered air purifying, and supplied air functional modes of the Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) family of systems. Mask and filter system upgrades will be provided for fielded Protection systems to enhance respiratory and ocular protection.

Starting in FY21, JSGPM BA7 funding and efforts are transitioning under the MODPROT IP budget line.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MODERNIZATION PROTECTION (MODPROT)

In FY21, MODPROT will be split into three programs to fund three separate Modernization Efforts:  Modernization Protection Collective Protection (MODPROT CP), Modernization Protection Decontamination (MODPROT DE), and Modernization Protection Individual Protection (MODPROT IP).  The original MODPROT acquisition strategies will continue to be followed after the transition occurs in FY21.

Modernization Collective Protection (MODPROT CP) leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded collective protection systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.

MODERNIZATION PROTECTION INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION (MODPROT IP)

MODPROT IP leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded individual protection systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.

SPU RAPID CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT (SPU RCDD)

Non-traditional projects will be executed for capabilities identified by Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), select elements from across the Special Operations Forces (SOF) Enterprise, and other Joint Force enabling units.  The SPU RCDD BA5 acquisition strategy for developmental efforts will allow rapid prototyping and testing of mission critical capabilities needed to enhance mission success.  The SPU RCDD BA7 modernization effort will use technical and functional evaluations of currently-fielded items to introduce and incorporate operationally-relevant system developments.  Both efforts will be accomplished by awarding an agreement through the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Authority (CWMD OTA) for the procurement of test assets.  An OTA contracting approach will be used to procure test prototypes and test articles of possible solutions.  The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  Procurement will be through either the OTAs, a Small Business Innovative Research contract, or a more traditional contracting vehicle.

JS GENERAL PURPOSE MASK (JSGPM)

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) allows for continual technology refreshment and development of an improved single mask filter that would be certified for use in both domestic and military operations.  Existing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contracts and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts will be used to mature technologies transitioned from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to obtain higher Technology Readiness Level (TRL) that can be inserted into fielded systems.  The complexity of maturing these different items requires an evolutionary approach with one prototype iteration governing the approach on the next iteration.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems. During this phase efforts will execute modernization, bug fixes, and provide support at fielded locations and maintain training and logistics support.

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Global Biosurveillance Portal (Global-BSP),
(2) Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Information Systems (CBRN IS)
(3) Joint Effects Model 1 and 2 (JEM 1 and 2)
(4) Joint Warning and Reporting Network 1 and 2 (JWARN 1 and 2), and
(5) Software Support Activity (SSA).

The Global-BSP is an unclassified, web-based computer and mobile application which facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the preparedness, detection, management, and mitigation of CBRN, as well as all hazard events. These capabilities enable the use of data visualization, real-time messaging and file sharing, and DoD and USG cooperation to expedite the timely identification and detection of CBRN events in order to minimize operational impacts to the local and global populations.

CBRN IS provides the Joint warfighter, CBRN community of interest, and international partners a collaborative Cloud hosted environment.  This cloud environment allows users to collect and disseminate CBRN warning and reporting data, provide detailed CBRN hazard predictions, aid in decision support, and make relevant CBRN defense information available in near-real time. CBRN IS supports the implementation of Integrated Early Warning (IEW) capabilities that allow users to access netted sensor information, data fusion, disease modeling, biosurveillance data, source term estimation data, incident management tools, and planning and analysis capabilities. The CBRN IS enterprise makes CBRN decision aids readily accessible from any computer through a web browser simplifying interoperability, reducing integration and deployment costs, and increasing cybersecurity protection.

The JEM 1 and JEM 2 are software applications that provide the Department of Defense (DoD) with the only operationally tested and accredited tools to model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents. JEM 1 and JEM 2 apply advanced physics using weather, terrain, and agent characteristics to predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM). JEM 1 and JEM 2 display hazard information on the Common Operational Picture (COP) and allow commanders to assess risk and take steps mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) on operational forces. The JEM 1 program sunsets and has been replaced by JEM 2.  JEM 1 program support will be terminated upon full expenditure of FY19 funding.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) 1 and 2 are software applications that provide the Department of Defense warning and reporting systems that enable an immediate and integrated response to threats of contamination by WMD, CBRN and TIM incidents. JWARN 1 and 2 provide a digital display of CBRN reports on the COP, presented through Service provided Command and Control systems resident at all echelons of command. Enhanced situational battlespace awareness provides Commanders the ability to support warfighter battle management and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment. The JWARN 1 program sunsets and has been replaced by JWARN 2 program and will no longer be supported at the end of FY20.
 
The SSA provides for enterprise services in the areas of software development, network architecture, cybersecurity, technology transition, and information assurance standards and policies to support programs with modernization and upgrade efforts to fielded systems to ensure network, cybersecurity, and standards compliance throughout the Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense (CBRND) portfolio.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Global-BSP program is using the SOFCIDS (Special Operations Capabilities Integration and Development System) requirements approach and the JROC's "IT Box" acquisition construct which allows fielding of operational capabilities while continued R&amp;D matures technology required for follow-on versions.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple iterative fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event, and field products to the warfighter utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  The Global-BSP will achieve Full Operational Capability, complete resourced capabilities, and commence an orderly transition to sustainment in 2020.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

CBRN INFORMATION SYSTEMS

CBRN IS acquisition strategy utilizes a Family-of-Systems (FoS) approach to align multiple capabilities to the CBRN-IS architecture and operational environment. CBRN IS leverages the concepts of CBRN Hazard Awareness and Understanding and DISA Enterprise Services to integrate current CBRN capabilities, and other information and intelligence services, applications, and systems to provide increased situational awareness and decision support to commanders for CBRN defense. The strategy supports the implementation of integrated early warning capabilities by incorporating mature science and technology products and emerging technologies from existing advanced technology demonstrations (ATD) and experimental capability demonstrations (ECD). CBRN IS utilizes the Agile software development process to provide for the spiral development and fielding of modular capability packages.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

The JEM 2 acquisition strategy utilizes Agile software development practices, employing the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fieldings in lieu of a single fielding event.  As part of the strategy, an over-arching Milestone B and Build Decision for Requirements Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) were approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in 4QFY14.  Subsequent RDPs have been approved along with Capability Drops (CD) that define capability sets to be developed, tested, and fielded operationally.  JEM will prioritize and complete resourced CD's for RDP 1 and 2 to transition into sustainment.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 acquisition utilizes Agile software development practices, employing the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fieldings in lieu of a single fielding event.  As part of the strategy, an over-arching MS B and Build Decision for Requirements Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) were approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in 4QFY14.  Subsequent RDPs have been approved along with Capability Drops (CD) that define capability sets to be developed, tested, and fielded operationally.  JWARN will prioritize and complete resourced CD's for RDP 1 and 2 to transition into sustainment.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities.

Efforts in this project include:
(1) Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) 

The NGDS is a family of systems providing increments of diagnostic capabilities over time that address varied CBR threats across the different echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBR threat and infectious disease identification and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance. NGDS 1 improves diagnostic capabilities in deployable and laboratory-based combat health support units. NGDS 1 offers improved operational suitability and affordability over legacy systems by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on an existing commercial diagnostic device with a well-established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS 1 program was a MS A to MS C - acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 is replacing the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. NGDS 1 Full Rate Production was approved in Aug 2018.

NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 continued the technology maturation and risk reduction of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY18 and transitioned to engineering and manufacturing development phase in FY19.  NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a chemical diagnostic capability in FY18. Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements. Development efforts are cost-plus awards using Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings. NGDS 2 is broken out into NGDS 2 CHEMDx and NGDS 2 MPDS starting in FY21.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded medical nerve agent treatment system that contribute to the layered medical defenses against chemical warfare agent threats facing U.S. Forces in the field.  

The effort included in this project are:

(1) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS)
(2) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System Centrally Acting (INATS CA)
(3) Alternative Autoinjector Manufacturer Capability (AUTOINJ)

(1) INATS - Soman Nerve Agent Pre-Treatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP) is a modernization effort for Pyridostigmine Bromide (PB) requirements from the joint service users for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved SNAPP product.

(2) INATS-CA advanced development provides a centrally-acting anticholinergic agent to increase survivability and decrease morbidity after exposure to toxic nerve agent threats. Scopolamine was selected for development after an extensive analysis of alternatives and review of data by the Science and Technology community. Added to the currently fielded system, the INATS-CA program will improve overall medical outcomes and will be utilized as both a vial for use at definitive care and a stand-alone auto-injector for use in the field.  

(3) AUTOINJ consists of investigating an FDA approved alternative source(s), beyond the single current Department of Defense (DoD) source, for autoinjectors that deliver DoD nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the warfighter; mitigates capability fielding and operational readiness risks.  This resulted from the manufacturing and quality issues for the fielded Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA) product, the oxime (2-PAM) and atropine in a dual chambered autoinjector.  This program augments legacy autoinjectors, ATNAA, 2-PAM, and CANA by providing alternative commercial sources which include Dual Drug Delivery Device (D4), the atropine autoinjector, and anti-convulsant autoinjector.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Alternative Autoinjector Manufacturer Capability (AUTOINJ) will identify an alternative source(s) to develop and provide required FDA-approved autoinjector-delivered nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the DoD.  Currently, a single DoD source provides all of these capabilities.  

The AUTOINJ effort leverages novel technologies and industrial base expansion in order to develop the autoinjector products.  AUTOINJ uses contracts and Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs) in which the performer shall be responsible for conducting development and testing activities consistent with current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and/or licenses. Upon FDA approval, purchases for product sustainment will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency. 

AUTOINJ (MC7) Post marketing commitments and requirements are anticipated as a result of the FDA approval and will be the responsibility of the contractor and the government.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

The INATS (MC4) program concludes as INATS in FY19. 

In the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) phase, close collaborations will occur with the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies and clinical safety studies.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, the Government will engage with commercial partner(s) to ensure that INATS CA development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  In FY21 and beyond, the Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced this program for higher priorities, resulting in only the INATS CA component being pursued.

The INATS (MC7) line initiates in FY20 and transitions to INATS CA (MC7) in FY21.  INATS (MC7) will support the modernization of Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP) using contract actions to extend operational shelf-life and generate data to expand storage temperature conditions.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides revitalization of existing instrumentation and technology upgrades to equipment at West Desert Test Center (WDTC) and BioTesting Division (BTD) Chemical Biological Center (CBC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), in support of their Chemical and Biological (CB) test mission. 

Efforts included in the project are:
(1) BioTesting Division T&amp;E Upgrade (BTD UPGRADE)
(2) T&amp;E Upgrades (T&amp;E UPGRADE)

BTD UPGRADE supports the MRTFB test mission of the BioTesting Division (BTD) Chemical Biological Center (CBC) at DPG through instrumentation revitalization and technology upgrades to aging and obsolete equipment. These efforts maintain readiness at the BTD, which is the MRTFB's only laboratory equipped to test with aerosolized biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) agents. The BTD test mission requires cutting-edge biological laboratory and field testing capabilities to ensure the ability of the Department of Defense to test state-of-the-art materiel under development against known and emergent biological threats. Essential instrumentation requiring periodic revitalization and modernization due to technological obsolescence includes dissemination, referee, analytical, and lab and field instrumentation/equipment (e.g. field fluorescence aerosol particle sizing, next generation genomic sequencing, time of flight mass spectrometer, and lab entry control system upgrades).

The T&amp;E Upgrade effort supports upgrades to equipment for field testing, the major test chambers Materiel Test Facility (MTF), and the Combined Chemical Test Facility (CCTF).  Field test equipment includes all dissemination and field referee equipment and will include all upgraded test grid equipment transitioned from advanced development.  The MTF houses chambers and fixtures for chemical agent and non-traditional agent (NTA) testing, including the secondary containment modules (SCMs) and chemical agent vapor (CAVs) chambers.  The Combined Chemical Test Facility (CCTF) is a laboratory campus that houses labs and chambers for chemical agent and non-traditional agent testing.  Laboratories are equipped with chemical analytical equipment, including a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, gas chromatographs (GC), GC-mass spectrometers (GC-MS), MS triple quads, Miniature Chemical Agent Monitoring System (MINICAMS), and liquid chromatographs MS (LCMS).  The majority of the laboratory hood space at WDTC is in the CCTF.  The CCTF houses test fixtures such as the small item decontamination (SID) fixture, mask, boot and glove, filter and swatch test fixtures.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

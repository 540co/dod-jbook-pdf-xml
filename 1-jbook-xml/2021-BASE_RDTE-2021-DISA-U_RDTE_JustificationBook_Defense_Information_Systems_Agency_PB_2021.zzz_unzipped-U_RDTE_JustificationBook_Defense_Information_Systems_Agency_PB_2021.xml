            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System - Joint (GCSS-J), is a key enabler for achieving Focused Logistics and is essential during peace, contingency, crisis, and war in support of the joint warfighter across the full range of military operations. GCSS-J, the Logistics System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture to ensure the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to mobilize, move, and sustain all elements of operating forces within a theater or operational area. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide a fused, integrated, near real-time, multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., supply, deployment and distribution, engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports. GCSS-J provides real time actionable information in the form of watchboards (e.g., fuels and munitions watchboards) and near real time information in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$0.066 in FY 2019 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs and -$.510 was reprogrammed to support Other Transaction Authority (TOA) contract.

The decrease of -$1.708 in FY 2021 is due to realignment of funds to PE 0303150K for JPES Phase 2 Modernization.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), manages the Department’s Interoperability Test, Evaluation, and Certification process that is structured to provide meaningful and independent test results in order to increase stakeholder confidence.  The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities, are to validate that DISA’s (and the Department’s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&amp;E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA’s T&amp;E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA’s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&amp;E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. 

As the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: 
  •  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.
  •  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical Data systems.
  •  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. 
  •  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.
  •  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD’s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT/NSS). 
  •  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

JITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: 
  •  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  
  •  Conducting assessments during one of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).
  •  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. 
  •  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. 
  •  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).
  •  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
  •  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. 
 
As the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.

JITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) events to determine if IT/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  

JITC focuses its efforts towards core T&amp;E improvements, better T&amp;E policy for IT/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.

The T&amp;E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA’s MRTFB each year are to:  
  •  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.
  •  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. 
  •  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&amp;E on changing or emerging technologies. 
  •  Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual, operationally-relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue to plan, develop and execute enterprise-level data collection during multiple yearly test events.  Continue to support DDTE, provide enhanced functionality, expand T&amp;E capability, and perform automated evaluations of net-centric capabilities with improved assessment methodologies and practices due to incorporating new technologies such as cloud computing, mobile technology, and “big data”.  Continue enhancement of instrumentation and automated data collection tools to support testing on multiple network domains and enclaves where the DCGS PoRs, National Agencies and Coalition Partners test and operate.  Continue to develop T&amp;E methodology and tools to support testing of enterprise cybersecurity solutions to determine if they comply with standards, support interoperability between the DCGS PoRs, and meet the DCGS Enterprise cybersecurity requirements.  Continue to conduct compliance testing of data, metadata, and web services against established standards to enhance the sharing and promote reuse of net centric solutions.  Continuing to expand Testing as a Service (TaaS) capabilities that enable DCGS entities and other Communities of Interest (COIs) to test for standards compliance during the development and acquisition processes.  All data collected by these assessment efforts are reflected in an annual DCGS Enterprise Assessment Report that delineates how well the DCGS Enterprise shows progress over time in meeting the capabilities and closing the gaps reflected in the 2016 DCGS Enterprise Initial Capabilities Document.</r2:Text>

Continue to plan, develop and execute enterprise-level data collection during multiple yearly test events.  Continue to support DDTE, provide enhanced functionality, expand T&amp;E capability, and perform automated evaluations of net-centric capabilities with improved assessment methodologies and practices due to incorporating new technologies such as cloud computing, mobile technology, and “big data”.  Continue enhancement of instrumentation and automated data collection tools to support testing on multiple network domains and enclaves where the DCGS PoRs, National Agencies and Coalition Partners test and operate.  Continue to develop T&amp;E methodology and tools to support testing of enterprise cybersecurity solutions to determine if they comply with standards, support interoperability between the DCGS PoRs, and meet the DCGS Enterprise cybersecurity requirements.  Continue to conduct compliance testing of data, metadata, and web services against established standards to enhance the sharing and promote reuse of net centric solutions.  Continuing to expand TaaS capabilities that enable DCGS entities and other COIs to test for standards compliance during the development and acquisition processes.  All data collected by these assessment efforts are reflected in an annual DCGS Enterprise Assessment Report that delineates how well the DCGS Enterprise shows progress over time in meeting the capabilities and closing the gaps reflected in the 2016 DCGS Enterprise Initial Capabilities Document.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The JAIC was established to preserve and expand our military advantage in support of the Department’s 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS). As a primarily executing body it will accelerate the delivery of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled capabilities, scale the Department-wide impact of AI, and synchronize Department of Defense (DoD) AI activities to expand Joint Force advantages.  The JAIC mission is to accelerate the delivery of AI to achieve impact scaled across the DoD at relevant speed to transform the DoD and ensure the nation maintains a competitive advantage.  JAIC capitalizes on Project Maven’s efforts as the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD to further critical AI architecture and prototyping to rapidly expand AI to other mission areas. As JAIC efforts prove relevant, they will expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use, and increase Joint Force capability.  Most military data storage, utilization, and analytic tools and systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. JAIC capabilities are commercial technology initiatives that insert commercial AI into existing programs of record. 

JAIC will execute an initial sequence of cross-functional use cases to demonstrate value and create momentum, called National Mission Initiatives (NMI). NMIs will rapidly develop and deploy AI across the Joint Force for selected high-priority, pressing operational or business reform challenges. Additionally, JAIC will work closely with individual components to help identify, shape, and accelerate component-specific AI deployments, called Component Mission Initiatives (CMI). Both NMI and CMI efforts will include selecting commercial and academic partners for prototypes, and develop standardized processes with respect to data, testing and evaluation, and cybersecurity. JAIC will use lessons learned from these initial projects to establish new processes and standards that will be repeatable across additional projects and immediately relevant to the Joint Force. This will be done in collaboration with partners across technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), services, and international partners.

To support NDS, the JAIC will catalyze and develop AI capabilities to enhance readiness and lethality and ensure DoD maintains an advantage over adversaries.  JAIC will spearhead this unique opportunity to expand the competitive space across all domains with AI. JAIC efforts will directly contribute to increased military readiness towards a more lethal Joint Force, it will strengthen alliances and attract new partners by focusing on global problems, and it will enable Departmental reform to increase performance and affordability.  JAIC will cultivate workforce talent by recruiting, developing, and retaining high-quality personnel to enable the development and delivery of AI.  This will bring critical skills into the department by drawing outside expertise, and leveraging small companies, start-ups, and universities.  Implementing AI at a speed of relevance hinges on the ability to integrate AI better than our adversaries, and the JAIC will enable the Department to adapt AI into how it fights. JAIC will focus on speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and frequent capability delivery sprints. To fully realize this potential, the JAIC will pioneer AI approaches across the full scale of the global enterprise in a manner that is jointly interoperable with allies, partners, military Services, and agencies. Specifically, JAIC will identify and implement new organizational approaches, establish key AI building blocks and standards, develop and attract AI talent, and introduce new operational models that will enable DoD to systematically take advantage of AI at enterprise scale. The JAIC will fulfill the National Security Strategy and NDS to ensure conventional overmatch through dual-use commercial technology and partnered DoD-developed AI. The JAIC will collaborate with non-governmental organizations, corporations, strategic influencers, and partners and allies. JAIC will seize the initiative to lead the world in the development and adoption of transformative defense AI solutions that are safe, ethical, and secure. JAIC will spearhead this effort, engaging with the best minds in government, the private sector, academia, and international community.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>JAIC continues AI enabled product delivery to enable the National Defense Strategy across multiple National Mission Initiative (NMI) focus areas. JAIC continues to deliver AI Capability lines of effort begun during FY2019 in the areas of Predictive Maintenance (PMx) and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR), and expand into the National Mission Initiative Areas of Cyber Sense-making, Intelligence Business Automation, Joint Warfighting and Predictive Health.  Second, the JAIC continues to build the Joint Common Foundation (JCF), a cloud enabler that provides foundational AI tools and to enable centralized direction, and decentralized development and experimentation.  JAIC will develop and harden the JCF Development and Test environments to provide reusable AI workspaces, development tools, data repository and data ingestion and conditioning. Third, the JAIC will grow into the DoD AI Center of Excellence brokering partnerships among AI stakeholders, growing DoD-wide expertise in AI engineering, mathematics, cognitive services and data science, and providing a governance framework for synchronizing the DoD AI strategy and the implementation of FY2019 NDAA Section 238 tasks.  
The JAIC continues the Predictive Maintenance (PMx) NMI begun in FY19 to improve the availability of military airframes by minimizing downtime for maintenance. In FY20, the JAIC will work with the Army to operationalize an AI-enabled advance engine health model to replace imprecise, manually intensive aircraft maintenance schedule.  AI-enabled predicted engine failures will allow operational planners, program offices, and supply personnel to anticipate and provide maintenance intervention ahead of otherwise reactive and costly depot maintenance.  In FY20, the JAIC will work with stake holders to analyze and reform existing workflows, perform environmental data analysis and identify alternative ways to create a user interface for maintenance stakeholders to leverage high performance computing results to better anticipate fleet health and availability.
The JAIC continues the HA/DR NMI begun in FY19 to create AI-enabled geo-rectified disaster response maps in minutes rather than hours or days.  This capability will be used to transform disaster center response operations that currently rely on time consuming, manually curated maps to identify disaster perimeters (e.g. fire or flood lines), vulnerable infrastructure and to direct first responders with greater speed, precision and agility.  In FY20 the JAIC will work with component transition partners to test end-to-end integration of AI model performance in delivering Keyhole Markup Language (KML) map layers for use in response center’s Common Operating Picture (COP).  This will require the test and evaluation of each part of the AI pipeline from sensors, to models, to integrating data feeds and ultimately designing a user interface that emergency response operators will use to understand, edit, validate and employ the use of AI-enabled map layers to protect infrastructure and save lives. 

In FY20 the JAIC will begin the Joint Warfighting NMI to increase the speed, precision and agility of warfighting through improved Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2), the autonomous application of systems, sensors, and targeting solutions, and accelerated AI-enabled mission command. Currently, structuring and organizing operations and intelligence data sources is manual, slow and imprecise. The Joint Warfighting NMI will develop an application platform for JADC2 using open-API tools to automate the fusion and curation of a unified purpose-built information set. During FY20, the Joint Warfighting NMI will conduct an exhaustive assessment of current tools, techniques and data sources within scope for the JADC2 platform, build a viable architecture and repeatable data curation and fusion pipeline. This open API data fusion platform, will provide the foundation for future AI enabled workflows related to the identification, tracking and targeting within a well understood and appropriately governed data-driven command and control eco system. 
In FY20 the JAIC will begin the Warfighter Health NMI to accelerate health classification, individual diagnoses, and enable resilient field medicine. AI enabled capabilities can enable population inferences about treatments, readiness, and work conditions with greater speed and precision. In FY20 this NMI will focus on building a structured Medical Readiness repository of data that fuses multiple sources of health care, physical performance and veterans affairs assessments in order to leverage AI capabilities to reduce the time it takes to perform Readiness and Disability Adjudications hours to minutes per warfighter.  The Warfighter Health NMI will create a repeatable AI architecture and pipeline for classifying disability conditions during FY20, setting the conditions for FY21.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>JAIC will begin to transition the lines of effort in the areas of Predictive Maintenance (PMx) and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) to service and component partners.  These capabilities are expected to be available on the JCF for reuse by many. As soon as an NMI has fully transitioned ongoing lines of effort, those JAIC resources will be aligned to kick off new AI Capability lines of effort in accordance with the direction of the DOD AI ESG.  The JAIC will mature AI enabled capabilities in the National Mission Initiative Areas of Cyber Sense-making, Intelligence Business Automation, Joint Warfighting and Predictive Health and will begin to plan and prepare for their transition to component transition partners.  The JAIC will begin up to 5 new lines of effort within the six National Mission areas.  By FY21, 90% of NMIs Development and Test will be accomplished in the JCF.  The JCF will provide a collaboration portal for the DoD, a registry for DoD AI Projects and optimized JCF virtual environments provisioned with the right tools, suited to the users and developers assigned to given project.  In FY21 the JCF will begin testing capabilities on the SIPR domain. 
In FY21 the JAIC will continue the Cyber Sense-making NMI that was begun in FY20 to shrink timelines for cyber-threat situational awareness using AI anomaly detection and network exploration techniques.  In FY21 the NMI will leverage the CSSP gold standard benchmark dataset, and the completed GOTS assessments o AI-enabled cyber threat detection applications to deploy the highest performing tools and models, along with the lessons learned, to the Joint Common Foundation for wide-spread adoption.
In FY21 the JAIC will begin the Intelligent Business Automation (IBA) NMI to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of routine tasks by enabling DoD staff to use robotic process automation (RPA) and other AI tools. In FY21, based on the most promising RPA technologies and workflows, this NMI will gain temporary authority to operate (ATO) and authority to connect (ATC), and will conduct operational experiments. The Intelligent Business Automation (IBA) will deliver a platform of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) services and platform to save manhours, reduce routine errors in back-office processes. 
In FY21 the JAIC will continue the Joint Warfighting NMI started in FY20 to increase the speed, precision and agility of warfighting through improved Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2), the autonomous application of systems, sensors, and targeting solutions, and accelerated AI-enabled mission command.  The Joint Warfighting NMI will continue to develop and mature the application platform for JADC2 using open-API tools to automate the fusion and curation of a unified purpose-built information set. Based on the FY20 assessment of current tools, techniques and data sources within scope for the JADC2 platform, the approved architecture and a repeatable data curation and fusion pipeline, the JW NMI will design and build AI enabled workflows related to the identification, tracking and targeting within a well understood and appropriately governed data-driven command and control eco system.
In FY21 the JAIC will continue the Warfighter Health NMI to accelerate health classification, individual diagnoses, and enable resilient field medicine. In FY21, this NMI will leverage the structured Medical Readiness repository of data created in FY20 to reduce the time it takes to perform Readiness and Disability Adjudications hours to minutes per warfighter.  In FY21 this NMI will expand on early successes dynamically classifying disabling conditions. The NMI will leverage the Medical Readiness data, architecture, and repeatable AI pipeline to train a machine to recognize all 50 categorically disabling conditions, in anticipation of wide deployment during subsequent fiscal years.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), manages the Department’s Interoperability Test, Evaluation, and Certification process that is structured to provide meaningful and independent test results in order to increase stakeholder confidence.  The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities, are to validate that DISA’s (and the Department’s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&amp;E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA’s T&amp;E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA’s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&amp;E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. 

As the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: 
  •  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.
  •  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical Data systems.
  •  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. 
  •  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.
  •  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD’s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT/NSS). 
  •  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

JITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: 
  •  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  
  •  Conducting assessments during one of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).
  •  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. 
  •  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. 
  •  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).
  •  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
  •  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. 
 
As the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.

JITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) events to determine if IT/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  

JITC focuses its efforts towards core T&amp;E improvements, better T&amp;E policy for IT/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.

The T&amp;E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA’s MRTFB each year are to:  
  •  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.
  •  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. 
  •  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&amp;E on changing or emerging technologies. 
  •  Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As the only non-Service activity of the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) provides the only dedicated Information Technology (IT) environment investing in a single end-to-end infrastructure for testing the Enterprise Edge to the Tactical Edge.  As an MRTFB, Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) provides tested IT infrastructure products to the DoD, Federal/non-Federal Government, Commercial vendors, and Allied partners.  

The DISA MRTFB infrastructure:

  •  Encompasses two geographic locations (Ft. Huachuca, AZ; Ft. Meade, MD). 

  •  116K square feet of raised floor space comprised of multiple test environments and test networks supporting over 100 programs on an annual basis.
  
  •  Complies with multiple levels of security and is scaled to support approximately 1,000 annual testing events to evaluate the DoD's converged information environment, Cyber, Cloud services, Mobility, and National Security Systems (NSS).

  •  Encompasses a significant portfolio of reference implementations, test tools, and supporting IT systems to aid both test execution and data collection/analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Infrastructure Engineering and Integration effort encompasses two projects: Modeling and Simulation and DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support. There are two major activities under the Modeling and Simulation project: Modeling and Simulation and DODIN Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE).

The DODIN EWSE activity resolves near term (one to three years) high-priority technical issues defined by DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), that impact operational capabilities affecting DODIN End-to-End (E2E) interoperability and performance. 

The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.

The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support project performs discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technologies through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) Emerging Technology Directorate (EM) (formerly OCTO) to fill capability shortfalls and technology gaps across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  EM identifies these gaps/shortfalls, pursues leading innovative solutions from industry, academia, and the Federal sector, and engages industry partners for commercial best practices.  EM conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight of DISA and DoD enterprise products and services.  EM resolves mission partner gaps and agency challenges requiring technical and/or process innovation in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI), Mobility, Assured Identity, Rapid Transition, Cyber Defense, and Blockchain among other technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease in FY 2019 is due to the decrease of -$0.556 for a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs and the decrease of -$2.025 was reprogrammed to support Other Transaction Authority (OTA) requirement. 

The decrease of -$5.000 in FY 2020 reflects a congressional general reduction.

The increase of +$0.098 is due to the expansion to resolve mission partner gaps and agency challenges requiring technical and or process innovation.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and end-to-end (E2E) analytical functions for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Modeling and Simulation activities support the Department of Defense (DoD) communications planning and investment strategy, including: application performance assessments, contingency planning, network capacity planning and diagnostics, and systems-level modeling and simulation. Project efforts provide across-theater information awareness for Combatant Commands through application solutions for integrated networks, including DoD’s missions in Afghanistan and the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) by: (1) supporting the development and implementation of DoD Information Network (DODIN) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) processes essential to evolving the DODIN in a manner that enables interoperability and E2E performance for critical DODIN programs; (2) developing standardized DISA systems analyses and integration processes to improve systems integration across DISA for all DISA developed communication systems and services; and (3) providing the underlying modeling and simulation and analytical support for E2E DISA and DoD systems engineering and assessment. 

Project efforts provide DoD decision makers with services and a suite of tools capable of identifying key points of impact on DoD command and control information systems and recommending trade-offs within the DODIN configuration with regard to prioritized performance, availability, and security. This effort will reduce the risk in products deployed to the warfighter through improved network performance and traffic analysis, and an efficient means of troubleshooting and subsequent redesign.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) uses contractors to assist/supplement the Government lead/team for technical activities. Subject matter experts in both large and small businesses are sought for the engineering support. Firm fixed price contracts with one option year are typically used in open competition. Furthermore, technical work with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) such as MITRE and MIT Lincoln Lab are established and coordinated when the Government can leverage their expertise and R&amp;D in the key technology.  

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects. Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving DoD programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) are also considered depending upon the task.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support project identifies key technology areas that are essential for Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) including:  Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI), Mobility, Assured Identity, Rapid Transition, Cyber Defense, and Blockchain among other technologies.    

The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support Project ensure the technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) are in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and the latest Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO) Capabilities Planning Guidance (CPG) through the Emerging Technology Directorate (EM). These strategies will establish the foundation for DISA's technology investments and technical development. The EM leverages emerging technology to drive efficiencies and cost savings to the DoD, the Warfighter, and other Federal Agencies, and provides actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.

Cyber security and cloud computing present critical near term challenges, especially the ability to securely leverage commercial cloud service offerings. The EM’s partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions. Included are applications with a security wrapper that detect and mitigate cyberattacks; smart routing and managed reputation capability; embedded system defense capabilities; and resilient and intrusion-tolerant network capabilities.

Partnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services. The EM will conduct technology assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DODIN architecture and standards. Enabled by the Technology Assessment Framework (TAF) and the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR), the EM will perform “quick looks” and deeper technology evaluations to provide critical awareness, characterization, and suitability of specific technologies. These include the assessments of advanced cloud management capabilities; physical containers to enable mobile data center; emerging open source Storage Service Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and/or abstractions and global standards for storage services; analytic platform performance baselines of emerging commercial analytic platform products; advanced approaches to Continuity of Operations (COOP) in a hybrid cloud environment; and the next generation software defined networks for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The CTO will expand its focus on laboratory prototyping known as Software Defined Everything (SDE) which is based on the notion of using software to keep redefining itself, rather than being locked into operating in a specific way.  It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler to leverage capabilities from five principal areas. These five areas are; Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, Communication (DODIN, Mobile/End-User Devices).   CTO will conduct technical assessments for future cloud computing technologies and innovative service delivery models, mobile devices, application development and vetting best practices, and next generation virtualized Software Defined Networks (SDN) for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.  CTO will partner with commercial partners, academia, technical analysis centers, as well as organizations within the Intelligence Community, to bring state of the art capabilities to the DISA/DoD resulting in better communications and monitoring tools, enterprise services and improved end-user services and capabilities.  CTO will continue to pursue and refine methods, processes and strategies to assist in the acceleration of capability into the operational environment.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Federal Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defenses (DoD's) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) (formerly known as National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes engineering for Networking capabilities and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.

PNVC:  The PVNC provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military, satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   
 
DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Systems Engineering Support project encompasses four activities:

Next Generation Networking Technologies (formally known as Internet Protocol (IP) and Optical Transport Technology Refresh):  Provides engineering technical expertise to support and integrate newer, more efficient technologies required to replace end of lifecycle equipment and to achieve more efficient Networking technologies.  These new technologies provide protected and assured services for critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.	
																								
Element Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).																			
																			
Peripheral and Component Design (Secure Voice Switches):  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multi-level security (i.e., extensive conferencing/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  

DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Engineer with plans and procedures, systems analysis, operational assessments, systems engineering, and development of concepts of operation and architectures. The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war. MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the mission of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Systems Engineer to the Joint Staff and Executive Leadership. It also provides NC3 expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office. Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provide the sole means for verification of NC3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) mission focuses on developing Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise solutions to Combatant Commands, Services, and Defense-wide agencies to ensure critical mission execution in the face of cyber attacks.  The ISSP ensures that, the network, the computing centers, and core enterprise services will evolve to better support a joint cybersecurity/information assurance model that has common enterprise-scale perimeter defenses and will support a broad range of sharing policies from completely unclassified to tightly-held within a classified community.  The ISSP will test and develop active-active defensive capabilities; test and integrate software defined networking and orchestration closed-loop security; perform research, development and engineering of emerging cyber situational awareness technologies; harden the network by providing architecture support, systems engineering and analytical functions for Endpoint and Perimeter defense capabilities; cyber IT infrastructure and automation support to deploy enterprise-wide next generation identity technologies; and develop and evolve an integrated cyber domain security workforce to be on the leading edge of defensive capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The increase of +$22.651 in FY2019 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs (-$0.066) and an increase of +$22.717 received through a congressional reprogramming action for Secure Application Development (DevSecOps) (+$4.500); Identity Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) (+$12.200) and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) (+$6.000).  DevSecOps is to develop integrated tools and standards that enable users and partners to develop, deploy, and operate applications in a security and flexible environment.  ICAM will standardize credentialing capabilities for secure access to mobile devices and ZTA implements the Department's security protocols by continuously verifying everyone within the network.

The decrease of -$2.398 in FY 2020 is attributable to the Congressional directed transfer of Sharkseer from NSA to DISA ($1.882) and a Congressional general reduction of -$4.280 for unjustified growth.  

The decrease of -$3.982 in FY 2021 is due to an increase for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to further develop the DoD architectures for Zero-Trust Architecture and lab development (+$2.462) and a decrease due to the elimination of the DISA Cybersecurity Information Assurance Range, to avoid duplication of effort with the CYBERCOM Range under development. Also a reduction to cyber innovation and "DWR".</r2:SummaryExplanation>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

The GCCS-J Program is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint C2 system of record.  It incorporates core planning and assessment tools required by Combatant Commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs. It provides support for commanders and staffs as they conduct joint and multinational operations by providing a fused picture of the battle space within an integrated system that is supporting joint warfighter needs today.  GCCS-J is currently focused on sustainment, synchronization, and modernization to meet emerging operational needs by modifying and enhancing elements or capabilities in order to implement new requirements, enhance functionality, increase efficiency and lower operating and deployment costs while taking advantage of the progress made by current operational systems and technologies.  The GCCS-J program is also executing incremental modernization of C2 capabilities using the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved needs.

JPES is a portfolio of capabilities supporting joint policies, processes, procedures, and reporting structures. It is supported by communications and information technology used by the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC).  JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor the following activities: planning, execute mobilization, deployment, employment and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization.   At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment. One of the key capabilities residing within the JPES portfolio of sustaining the existing Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) while modernization of JOPES is planned and implemented.  The JPES portfolio also includes a core set of infrastructure services consisting of  the JPES Framework (JFW) and a variety of mission applications to include Joint Force Projection (JFP), Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM) and eventually the capabilities that will replace JOPES.

JC2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns closely to the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture.  The JC2 Architecture describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  It is the authoritative source of information and technical direction for the JC2 arena.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) is DoD’s Joint Command and Control (JC2) system of record and provides the foundation for migration of service-unique C2 systems into a Joint, interoperable environment. The Defense Information System Agency’s (DISAs) portfolio includes funding to support GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the JC2 Architecture.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  Additionally, DISA provides critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  

JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DOD’s Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 December 2005) and Adaptive Planning Roadmap II (5 March 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter a fully interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

The JC2 Architecture is a foundational element of JC2 capabilities for the Department.  The JC2 Architecture provides a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  Each year, the DISA architecture team produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities, anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the JC2 community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

  •  Continue to decompose applicable existing applications into services
  •  Limit local deployment and move as much to the enterprise as possible
  •  Continue to expose data and scale services to support an enterprise implementation
  •  Continue to evolve more economical hardware and software architecture without impact to the operational user or Family of Systems (FoS)/interface partners
  •  Reduce overall sustainment cost through use of more cost effective and appropriate Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Hardware (HW) products
  •  Evolve to use of agile development practices
  •  Consolidation of clients and tools</r2:Description>

The GCCS-J "must haves" is the set of capabilities identified by the Joint Staff and C2 community as absolutely critical to allow GCCS-J sites to migrate away from the current costly legacy hardware and COTS platform to more cost effective solutions.  The modernization effort will improve the current GCCS-J system's limitations and its ability to address current and projected cybersecurity and the increasing fragility of old code that puts the joint warfighter (front line to President) at risk jeopardizing operations and increasing fratricide risk.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Use of performance-based contract awards is maximized while use of Time and Material contracts is minimized to those providing programmatic support versus software development, integration, or testing.  All development, integration, and migration efforts within the portfolio are primarily supported through Cost Reimbursable Task Orders issued under competitively awarded contracts.  Acquisition Strategies are structured to retain contractors capable of satisfying cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  Contract awards incorporate provisions requiring contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data.  This strategy mitigates risk by requiring monthly Contract Performance Reviews (CPRs) and utilizing award fee contracts where appropriate to incentivize performance.  Both GCCS-J and JPES apply formal acquisition rigor to include reporting requirements, as appropriate, by acquisition program designation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) provides a full array of electromagnetic spectrum services and capabilities, ranging from short notice on-the-ground operational support at the forward edge, to long range planning in pursuit of national strategic objectives. These services/capabilities are in direct support of Combatant Commanders, the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer, Military Services, and Defense Agencies. The DSO is the focal point for electromagnetic spectrum analysis and the development of integrated spectrum plans and strategies to address current and future needs for DoD spectrum access. In addition, DSO serves as DoD's spectrum advocate at national and international forums and conducts extensive outreach to both industry and government. DSO also implements enterprise spectrum management capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency and agility to improve spectrum-dependent capabilities in support of United States and Coalition operations. This includes acquiring, implementing and sustaining the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS) which provides an integrated catalog of joint net-centric spectrum management tools and services. Electromagnetic Spectrum Management enables information dominance through effective spectrum operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$0.210 in FY 2019 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The decrease of -$1.499 in FY 2019 is due to a decrease in the number of prototype assessments that were accomplished for future capabilities during FY 2019.

The decrease of -$2.170 in FY 2020 is due to a Congressional general reduction.

The increase of $10.277 in FY2021 is a result of increase to develop Joint Electromagnetic Battle Management (EMBM) capabilities that provide situational awareness and joint integrating leveraging in the Electronic Warfare Planning Management Tool, the Joint Spectrum Data Repository and the Global Command &amp; Control System – Joint (GCCS-J).</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Spectrum Center (JSC), which is a division of Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO), designs, develops, and maintains Department of Defense (DoD) automated spectrum management systems, evaluation tools, and databases. The databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment (EME). Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts.
 
Improved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use. This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DISA provides a portfolio of services that includes legacy capabilities delivered by the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program supporting a resilient and flexible infrastructure that enables a collaborative environment for secure information sharing across the Department of Defense (DoD). These critical warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area services enable more than two million authorized DoD users to collaborate across the Combatant Commands (COCOMs)/Services/Joint Staff/Agency/Mission Partners using a suite of web-accessible services. The portfolio also includes the DoD Visitor service that transitioned from a Government developed service to a Commercial-Off-the-Shelf annual right-to-use licensed service operating on domain controllers throughout the DoD.  This service allows personnel to "go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive".  It includes the privilege management Authentication Gateway Services (AGS) and the DoD Enterprise Portal Service.  The AGS is integrated with the Identity and Access Management services supporting brokered Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication for DoD applications without a native PKI authentication capability.  The DoD Enterprise Portal Service provides users with a flexible web-based hosting solution to create and manage mission, community, organization, and user focused sites.  The individual suite of capabilities within the portfolio of services provides the user with the flexibility to couple the services in varying ways to support their mission needs. This flexibility provides unprecedented secure access to web and application content, critical imagery, intelligence and warfighter information from anywhere, at any time, on any DoD authorized device. The portfolio of enterprise services delivers tangible benefits to the Department by providing capabilities that are applied by the US Forces, Coalition forces, and Allied forces to support full spectrum joint and expeditionary campaign operations. These enabling benefits include the ability to:

•	Enhance collaborative decision-making processes
•	Improve information sharing and integrated situational awareness
•	Share and exchange knowledge and services between enterprise units and commands
•	Share and exchange information between previously unreachable and unconnected sources
•	Schedule and coordinate meetings with people across the DoD Components
•	"Go anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive"
•	Create and manage mission, community, organization, and user-focused sites from global locations
•	Exchange knowledge to enable situational awareness, determine the effects desired, select a course of action, the forces to execute it, and accurately assess the effects of that action

The portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint Warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Information Environment (JIE) construct is a consolidated secure and defensible environment across Department of Defense (DoD).  This is comprised of unified, consolidated and shared information technology (IT) infrastructure, enterprise services, and standardized security architectures throughout the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) to achieve full spectrum superiority, improve mission effectiveness, increase security and realize IT efficiencies.  

The target objective state of JIE is a DODIN that optimizes the use of DoD's IT assets from the administrative and operational planning at the Pentagon to the tactical edge; to include our mission partners through converging communications, computing, enterprise services, and defense of the DODIN that can be leveraged for all Department missions. 

When implemented, JIE will reduce DoD's Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), improved security by reducing the attack surface of our networks, and enable Combatant Commands/Services/Agencies (CC/S/A) to more efficiently access information to perform their missions from any authorized IT device, any time, from anywhere in the world.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Decrease in FY 2019 of -$0.290 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.

Decrease in FY 2020 of -$1.808 is due to a Congressional general reduction.

Increase in FY 2021 of $6.846 is due to transferring funds from the Services to DISA for planned deployment and operations.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a joint Department of Defense (DoD) security architecture deployed regionally throughout the world. Each of the 23 Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) and 25 Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The savings are realized by coupling the JRSS and JMS. The JRSS collapses replicated IT security functionality for all DoD components into relatively few regionally located stacks.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM). Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The net increase of +$4.470 in FY 2019 is attributed to (1) a decrease of -$1.467 which reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs and (2) an increase of  +$5.937 for additional support required for eApplication (eAPP) development which is the replacement for Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (eQIP) and additional prototype development to support investigations management. 

Decrease of -$14.500 in FY 2021 is due to the transfer of the National Background Investigation Services (NBIS) Program Executive Office (PEO) manpower and funding from DISA to Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA). Ensures compliance with National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018, Section 925.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act (CSEA) of 2004 created the Spectrum Relocation Fund (CSEA, Title II of P.L. 108-494) to provide a centralized and streamlined funding mechanism through which Federal agencies can recover the costs associated with relocating their radio communications systems from certain spectrum bands, which were authorized to be auctioned for commercial purposes. 

On January 29, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission completed an auction of Advanced Wireless Service licenses in the 1695-1710 Megahertz (MHz),1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz bands (collectively, the "AWS-3” bands). On June 23, 2015, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) notified Congress of the forthcoming transfer of $5.030 billion to federal agencies with systems affected by the AWS-3 transition. Following the conclusion of the 30-day statutory waiting period, OMB transferred the funds to the federal agencies. 

The Department of Defense (DoD) received $3.500 billion of the auction proceeds and created a $500 million Spectrum Access Research and Development Program (SAR&amp;DP) to investigate new DoD technologies. The SAR&amp;DP encompasses spectrum technology development that enables the DoD to perform its missions using spectrum-dependent systems in a manner that preferably enhances operational readiness and capability. Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for pursued technology solutions. DoD's transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are sufficiently resilient (survivable and electronically protected) to operate in both the United States and congested/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed. 

This program represents the DISA investment within the SAR&amp;DP.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual, operationally-relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue to plan, develop and execute enterprise-level data collection during multiple yearly test events.  Continue to support DDTE, provide enhanced functionality, expand T&amp;E capability, and perform automated evaluations of net-centric capabilities with improved assessment methodologies and practices due to incorporating new technologies such as cloud computing, mobile technology, and “big data”.  Continue enhancement of instrumentation and automated data collection tools to support testing on multiple network domains and enclaves where the DCGS PoRs, National Agencies and Coalition Partners test and operate.  Continue to develop T&amp;E methodology and tools to support testing of enterprise cybersecurity solutions to determine if they comply with standards, support interoperability between the DCGS PoRs, and meet the DCGS Enterprise cybersecurity requirements.  Continue to conduct compliance testing of data, metadata, and web services against established standards to enhance the sharing and promote reuse of net centric solutions.  Continuing to expand Testing as a Service (TaaS) capabilities that enable DCGS entities and other Communities of Interest (COIs) to test for standards compliance during the development and acquisition processes.  All data collected by these assessment efforts are reflected in an annual DCGS Enterprise Assessment Report that delineates how well the DCGS Enterprise shows progress over time in meeting the capabilities and closing the gaps reflected in the 2016 DCGS Enterprise Initial Capabilities Document.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Continue to revise and evolve test and evaluation (T&amp;E) data collection techniques and analysis strategies in support of DCGS Enterprise community members acquisition programs’ interoperability as they integrate capabilities and services solutions to address the operational gaps identified in the OUDS(I) sponsored Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Enterprise Capabilities Based Assessment.  Continue to plan, develop and execute enterprise-level data collection during multiple yearly test events.  Continue to support DDTE, provide enhanced functionality, expand T&amp;E capability, and perform automated evaluations of net-centric capabilities with improved assessment methodologies and practices due to incorporating new technologies such as cloud computing, mobile technology, and “big data”.  Continue enhancement of instrumentation and automated data collection tools to support testing on multiple network domains and enclaves where the DCGS PoRs, National Agencies and Coalition Partners test and operate.  Continue to develop T&amp;E methodology and tools to support testing of enterprise cybersecurity solutions to determine if they comply with standards, support interoperability between the DCGS PoRs, and meet the DCGS Enterprise cybersecurity requirements.  Continue to conduct compliance testing of data, metadata, and web services against established standards to enhance the sharing and promote reuse of net centric solutions.  Continuing to expand TaaS capabilities that enable DCGS entities and other COIs to test for standards compliance during the development and acquisition processes.  All data collected by these assessment efforts are reflected in an annual DCGS Enterprise Assessment Report that delineates how well the DCGS Enterprise shows progress over time in meeting the capabilities and closing the gaps reflected in the 2016 DCGS Enterprise Initial Capabilities Document.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated through post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This is not a new start.  Effort continues from FY 2020, funded in PE 0303150K, Global Command and Control System. The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

The GCCS-J Program is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint C2 system of record.  It incorporates core planning and assessment tools required by Combatant Commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs. It provides support for commanders and staffs as they conduct joint and multinational operations by providing a fused picture of the battle space within an integrated system that is supporting joint warfighter needs today.  GCCS-J is currently focused on sustainment, synchronization, and modernization to meet emerging operational needs by modifying and enhancing elements or capabilities in order to implement new requirements, enhance functionality, increase efficiency and lower operating and deployment costs while taking advantage of the progress made by current operational systems and technologies.  The GCCS-J program is also executing incremental modernization of C2 capabilities using the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY21, continue to support the Operational Community by incrementally developing, testing, and fielding additional GCCS-J 6.0 capabilities, as identified and prioritized by the Joint Staff and User community.  Most notably, this will involve enhancements to the following capability sets: 1) Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), 2) Personnel Recovery Report &amp; Locate (PRRL), and 3) Early Missile Warning.  In addition, in FY21, continue to support the Operational Community by incrementally developing, testing, and fielding upgrades to modernize, and enhance the cyber security posture of, the existing baseline in the following areas: 1) pursue IPv6 compliance, 2) modernize the server deployment, 3) enhance cyber security by addressing high priority focus areas, and 4) conducting database consolidation to increase overall system efficiency and performance.  These activities will be accomplished utilizing the GCCS-J 4 - 8 weeks Maintenance Release Process (MRP).

FY 2021 RDT&amp;E Plans: $23.026
Cyber security analysis is an ongoing aspect of the software lifecycle required to keep the system securely deployed. Continue to maintain the synchronization across DOD of GCCS-J, joint interfaces and the GCCS Family of Systems; continue to deliver capabilities as prioritized by the warfighter; and meet emerging operational priorities.  

Continue the development of the GCCS-JE Framework to meet the programs Initial Operational Capability.  In addition we will execute a development, integration and sustainment contract that will develop the functional capability that will be integrated in the framework design and sustain the capability as it is operationally deployed to the warfighter.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Use of performance-based contract awards is maximized while use of Time and Material contracts is minimized to those providing programmatic support versus software development, integration, or testing. All development, integration, and migration efforts within the portfolio are primarily supported through Cost Reimbursable Task Orders issued under competitively awarded contracts. Acquisition Strategies are structured to retain contractors capable of satisfying cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Contract awards incorporate provisions requiring contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data. This strategy mitigates risk by requiring monthly Contract Performance Reviews (CPRs) and utilizing award fee contracts where appropriate to incentivize performance. Both GCCS-J and JPES apply formal acquisition rigor to include reporting requirements, as appropriate, by acquisition program designation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

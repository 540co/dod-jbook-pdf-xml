            <proc:Description>This program funds replacement of organizational and intermediate level support equipment for all out-of-production missile systems, including ballistic, tactical and other missile weapon systems. Equipment procured is used for missile weapon systems maintenance and testing at organizational/intermediate (base/field) launch control facilities, as well as missile testing facilities. Programs will include analysis of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) risks and procurement activities related to DMSMS.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0101213F.

Ballistic Missile Items Less Than $5 Million:  Support Equipment Less Than $5M procures low cost new, modified or replacement support equipment.

MM Power Panels (PPM):  Minuteman Power Panels replaces obsolete and unsupportable power distribution panels within Launch Control Centers and Launch Facilities.

Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR):  Provides nuclear certified tractor and trailer to emplace, extract and transport the reentry system, Propulsion System Rocket Engine, and guidance systems. Replaces current payload transporter to meet USSTRATCOM security requirements and addresses supportability issues. Required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Perf Assess Data Sys Comm Equip Interface Unit (PADS CEIU II):  Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) is used to collect and analyze Missile Guidance Computer (MGC) data, Launch Facility (LF) faults and anomalies, as well as LF security and Environmental Control System (ECS) data. PADS is a critical MM III legacy data system, developed in the late 1970s and redesigned in 1996—1999, using commercial software. This program addresses PADS reliability, by updating software to meet Air Force software security requirements and to conform to the Air Force standard desktop configuration.

Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE):  RFSE replaces the current reentry system test set. RFSE will increase the Mean Time Between Failure, eliminate unneeded Mk12 functions, and add new Mk21 functions. It will provide capability to meet Department of Energy mandated Limited Life Component warhead swaps and to test electrical continuity during buildup of Minuteman III reentry systems.

Squadron Data Simulator (SDS):  The SDS simulates the command and control message traffic between a MM squadron of Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and the Launch Facilities (LFs). The system is used extensively to support Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) weapon system modification testing, field anomaly investigations, and the Hardened Surveillance Electromagnetic Pulse Program (HSEP). It provides extensive faulting and troubleshooting features and verifies operational status of LCCs and LFs following site modifications or extensive site maintenance.

Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP):  The Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP) replaces the current transporter erector used to emplace, extract and transport MM III boosters to and from launch facilities. TERP will update existing drawings, specifications and technical orders to eliminate parts obsolescence and address the intended usage through 2030.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY19 funding provides replacement support equipment items for an aging inventory of equipment which has become increasingly more costly to maintain. These items will increase ballistic missile system reliability and maintainability by providing state-of-the-art maintenance repair and testing capability. The program supports missile weapon systems such as the Minuteman III (LGM-30G), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120), Air Launched Cruise Missile (AGM-86A), and High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (AGM-88A). Requirements are jointly determined by Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) and are based on established allowance standards.

Items requested in FY19 are displayed on the attached P-40A. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements.

Ballistic Missile Items Less Than $5 Million:  Procures low cost support equipment required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

MM Power Panels (PPM):  Procures power panel replacements required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR):  Procures replacement payload transporters required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Perf Assess Data Sys Comm Equip Interface Unit (PADS CEIU II):  PADS Communications Equipment Interface Unit (CEIU) is used to transmit MM III Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Performance Data (IPD) from the Launch Control Center (LCC) to the PADS at the support base via telephone lines. CEIU is unclassified equipment, but interfaces with both classified and non-classified systems. This program will update the current CEIU. No modem will be needed for the updated version.

Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE):  The RFSE replaces unsupportable and unreliable support equipment and is required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Squadron Data Simulator (SDS):  SMIC SDS Replacement Program replaces failing SDS assets (a total of 12 systems). It is critical to operational certification of field LCCs and LFs, weapon system testing for modification programs, anomaly investigations, and HSEP.

Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP):  Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP) replaces current transporter erectors exhibiting structural integrity issues and addresses supportability issues. TERP is required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) is used to collect and analyze Missile Guidance Computer (MGC) data, Launch Facility (LF) faults and anomalies, as well as LF security and Environmental Control System (ECS) data. PADS is a critical MM III legacy data system, developed in the late 1970s and redesigned in 1996—1999, using commercial software. This program addresses PADS reliability, by updating software to meet Air Force software security requirements and to conform to the Air Force standard desktop configuration.

PADS Communications Equipment Interface Unit (CEIU) is used to transmit MM III Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Performance Data (IPD) from the Launch Control Center (LCC) to the PADS at the support base via telephone lines. CEIU is unclassified equipment, but interfaces with both classified and non-classified systems. This program will update the current CEIU. No modem will be needed for the updated version.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>The Reentry System Field Support Equipment (RFSE) program is producing test sets to replace the aging and obsolete Reentry System Test Set (RSTS) and the Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) Field Test Set (SFTS).  The RSTS was built in the late 1960s, using early 1960s technology.  The RSTS was designed to have a Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) of approximately 3000 hours but has degraded to about 24 hours at RFSE program initiation.  The replacement effort will consist of procuring Reentry System Test Consoles (RSTC), Forward Section Test Sets (FSTS), and sets of support equipment consisting of a RSTC Alignment Console and two FSTS calibration boxes per set.  This procurement action will be done to fulfill the requirements of AFGSC. 

The test sets will be used to test and functionally check out the MK12A and MK21 Reentry Systems and the MK12A Reentry Vehicle's Forward Sections.  The test sets support the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system ensuring its viability to 2030 and beyond. The RSTC will be able to check-out all possible SERV RS configurations.  The MK12A Forward Section will be checked-out by the FSTS, allowing simultaneous processing efforts to take place, reducing overall processing time in the Weapon Storage Area.  The MK21 Forward Sections will continue to be checked by the current SERV Arming and Fuzing Assembly Test Set (AFATS).</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>The SDS simulates the command and control message traffic between a MM squadron of Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and the Launch Facilities (LFs). The system is used extensively to support Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) weapon system modification testing, field anomaly investigations, and the Hardened Surveillance Electromagnetic Pulse Program (HSEP). It provides extensive faulting and troubleshooting features and verifies operational status of LCCs and LFs following site modifications or extensive site maintenance.
SMIC SDS Replacement Program replaces failing SDS assets (a total of 12 systems). It is critical to operational certification of field LCCs and LFs, weapon system testing for modification programs, anomaly investigations, and HSEP.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) is an ACAT 1 program. This program provides a long range, conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision guided, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft able to attack a variety of fixed or relocatable targets. There are two variants of the JASSM missile: JASSM baseline and JASSM extended range (JASSM-ER). Aircraft integration for the baseline missile is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 40-52), B-1, B-2, and F-15E. Aircraft integration for JASSM-ER is complete on the B-1B. Objective aircraft are the B-52H, F16C/D (Block 40-52), B-2 and F-15E. JASSM Lots 1 - 10 are covered under a warranty; 15 years for JASSM-ER and 20 years for JASSM baseline. Lots 11 and beyond are covered under a Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract and missile initial/replenishment spares program funds are required to fill the initial spare parts pipeline under this program.  Procurement quantities are estimates only and fall within a range of quantities based on negotiations for each specific lot contract. Total procurement of 4,900 includes JASSM baseline missiles (2,034) and JASSM-ER missiles (2,866). However, funding and quantity information prior to FY16 is identified in P-1 line Item 654515.

The JASSM program consists of two separable increments, JASSM baseline and JASSM extended range (JASSM-ER) - both with separate milestone decision points. Each version is broken out in P-5, P-5A, and P-21 in this document. The quantity, flyaway unit cost and weapon system unit cost lines in P-40 reflect JASSM PE (0207325F) only, which is a combination of both JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER. JASSM baseline has been in Full Rate Production (FRP). JASSM-ER started Full Rate Production in FY15, and JASSM-ER achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in December 2014 on the B-1B. FY18 will be the 16th production lot for the JASSM program. The program also plans to use some funds to evaluate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) material shortages, obsolescence issues, and reliability improvement, including flight testing.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207325F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY19 funding totals include $430.708M to procure 312 missiles and $61.6M in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) to procure 48 missiles. Production will remain at the most efficient rate, procuring 360 JASSM-ER missiles total.

Test Support/Reliability/Obsolescence increase due to inventory level increases. The program will continue reliability initiatives including Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP) flight testing of current production missiles.  

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S. Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) is a near-term solution for the Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW) air-launch capability gap that will provide flexible, long-range, advanced, anti-surface capability against high-threat maritime targets.  The Navy is the lead service for the LRASM program.  

The missile is developed based on JASSM-ER (Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range). Early operational capability for the LRASM is slated for 2018 on the U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancer and 2019 on the U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

The Department will transition the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)/Office of Naval Research (ONR) LRASM demonstration design into a fielded weapon system which will support an increased offensive strike capability with an Early Operational Capability (EOC) in 2018 for Air Force platforms and 2019 on Navy platforms.  FY17 was the first year of LRASM procurement and the program procures missiles over a three year period.  The program is also evaluating Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and reviewing obsolescence issues. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207325F, LRASM 
Additional production funding for this exhibit is also contained in Navy PE 0604786N Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare Weapon Dev</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The funds in FY19 will procure 12 LRASM missiles.

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S. Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The AIM-9X Block II/II+ Sidewinder (AIM-9X Blk II/II+) continues the evolution of the AIM-9 series of missiles. This missile program delivers a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive Infrared (IR) energy to acquire and track enemy air targets and complements the radar guided Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM).  Air superiority in short range engagements is essential to the Department of the Air Force, and this missile provides first shot, first kill opportunities against enemy targets employing IR countermeasures.  Anti-Tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  The AIM-9X Block II missile is critical to project power and win decisively in accordance with the Fiscal Year 2015 Defense Planning Guidance and Chief of Naval Operations' Navigation Plan for 2015-2019. 

AIM-9X is a Post Milestone C, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT-IC) joint service program led by the Department of the Navy.  In June 2011, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) established the AIM-9X Block II missile program which was approved for entry at Milestone C for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  The 2366 A/B certification and Acquisition Program Baseline for AIM-9X Block II was signed December 23, 2011, and the Block I program was terminated.  In August 2015, the program received approval for Full Rate Production (FRP), and the Acquisition Program Baseline was re-established.  FRP-3 was awarded in 2017.  The program plans to award FRP-4 in 2018 and FRP-5 in 2019.

In FY 2017, the program procured a third variant of the missile labeled the AIM-9X Block II PLUS (Block II+) to satisfy the requirements of the Joint Strike Fighter platform.  This version of the missile will be produced on the same production line as the regular AIM-9X Block II missile.  For contracting purposes, the nomenclature of the AIM-9X Block II missile will be identified as AIM-9X-2 and the AIM-9X Block II+ missile will be identified as AIM-9X-3.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207161F.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2019 provides funding to procure the fifth lot of Full Rate Production (FRP) AIM-9X Block II (Blk II) missiles, as well as the third lot of AIM-9X Block II Plus (Blk II+) missiles for the Navy.  FY 2019 also continues the procurement of missiles for the Army Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC2) program.  The program unit costs are based on quantities procured by all the US Navy, US Air Force and US Army as well as Foreign Military Sales customers.

Total Program quantity by service includes a mix of All Up Round (AUR) missiles and Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) as such:

The US Air Force will procure 5,030 total missiles under Budget Line Item 3479 (P1-4): 1,678 Block I missiles (1,093 AURs and 585 CATMs) and 3,352 Block II missiles, including Block II+ (2,859 AURs and 493 CATMs). In addition, the US Air Force procured 67 Block I missiles in FY 2001 under the AIM-9M Modification program (45 AURs and 22 CATMs).

The US Navy will procure 3,937 total missiles under Budget Line Item 2209: 1,289 Block I missiles (885 AURs and 404 CATMs) and 2,648 Block II missiles, including Block II+ (1591 AURs and 581 CATMs). In addition, the US Navy procured 63 Block I missiles in FY 2001 under the AIM-9M Modification program (48 AURs and 15 CATMs).

The US Army will begin to procure AIM-9X Block II missiles under Budget Line Item C6100 (P1-3).

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>The program is in production and any changes that will occur, prior to or after fielding, are software changes.  Hardware specs are available and being used to manufacture the missile.  Baseline software specs are known.

The FY19 Contract is scheduled for award in February 2019 and procures the Full Rate Production (FRP) missile.

Quantities decreased in FY19 - FY23 due to increased costs associated with the AIM-9X Block II+ missile. 

Block I is concluded and all funding/quantity data in the documents are associated with Block II activities.  The Block I program costs were $472.086M.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>Due to system limitations, the Annual Production Rates do not accurately reflect the programs limitations. The Minimum Sustainment Rate is 300 missiles of any mix required of All Up Rounds (Item 1), Captive Air Training Missiles (Item 2), Missile Container (Item 3) and All Up Round Block II Plus (Item 4). The ECON rate is 600 missiles of any mix required, and the MAX production rate is 1,400 missiles of any mix required. 

The MSR is for the combination of CATM, AUR Block II and AUR Block II+. Each individual item does not have an MSR. The MSR needs to be met by the overall program and not just per service. The MSR is shared by the USAF, USN, Army and FMS. 

Annual Production Rate limitations are based on 4 missiles per 1 container ratio.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>The Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) is the premier all-weather, all-environment radar guided missile developed jointly by the Air Force and Navy. The Air Force is the lead service. AMRAAM is a small, light, fast missile with improved capabilities against very low and high-altitude targets in an electronic attack (EA) environment. Funding also used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

FY19:  Due to parts limitations with Processor Replacement Program (PRP) missile configuration and a delay in the Form, Fit, Function Refresh (F3R) effort, the program office has adjusted FY19 production quantities to ensure a smooth production cut-in of F3R design.  There is a delta between USAF and USN All Up Round Unit Cost based on the different ratios of each missile type for each service. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207163F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY19 continues procurement and support of AMRAAM for the Air Force and Navy in Lot 33. USAF funds will procure 220 AIM-120D missiles.  Also, will modify existing and build additional tooling and test equipment to support production of the AIM-120D.  Continue to update the AMRAAM Technical Data Package to ensure a viable, producible design through the expected production life of the AMRAAM program.  Maintain a robust supplier base capable of sustaining AMRAAM production for the life of the program, while continuing to develop second source suppliers for critical items.  Resolve production Diminishing Manufacturing Sources/Material Shortages/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier/parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.  Continue to procure Telemetry (TM) Instrumentation Units for Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP).

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY2017 funding totals include $141.375M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.
FY2018 funding totals include $294.480M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations. 


The Army is the lead service for the Hellfire Missile program with Air Force missiles being procured through the Army's Redstone Arsenal. Hellfire missiles (all variants) provide precision-kill capability and has become a key weapon in Overseas Contingency Operations. Laser Hellfire uses semi-active laser terminal guidance. The latest variant provides for point target precision strike and is effective against countermeasures. The Hellfire missiles are used by the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper aircraft. HELLFIRE procurement funding supports the entire HELLFIRE system to include resolution of obsolescence, end of-life buys, safety, insensitive munitions, reliability, weapon integration activities, test sets, engineering changes, modifications, facilitization, production ramp-up activities and production issues. Funds may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues. Unit cost may vary depending on lead Service, other Services and/or FMS procurement quantities. Prior to FY2008, Hellfire missiles were procured under the Predator PE 0305219F. 

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0201109F.

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on  negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>FY2017 funding totals include $151.000M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations for SDB I.

FY2018 funding totals include $183.160M appropriated for SDB I Base and $90.920M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations for SDB I. 

1. Small Diameter Bomb Increment I (SDB I) is an Air Force ACAT II program providing increased kills per sortie on current and future aircraft platforms. SDB I addresses the following specific warfighter requirements: multiple kills per pass; multiple ordnance carriage; adverse weather, precision munitions capability; capability against fixed and stationary targets; reduced munitions footprint; increased weapons effectiveness; minimized potential for collateral damage; reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures; and standoff or Close Air Support (CAS) operational capability. Threshold aircraft is the F-15E. Objective aircraft include the F-22A, F-16, F-35A, B-1, A-10, B-52, MQ-9, and AC-130J. SDB I completed IOT&amp;E in Jun 2006 and commenced Full Rate Production (FRP) in Dec 2006. SDB I weapons and weapon containers are procured together as a system. Individual containers can be procured separately as requirements dictate.  SDB I procurement supports current combat operations and replenishment of SDB I weapons used in these operations.

Integrated platforms include:  F-15E, F-22A, AC-130W, and F-16 Block 30/40/50.  

2. GBU-53/B: Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II) is a joint interest United States Air Force (USAF) and Department of Navy (DoN) ACAT IC program with the USAF as the lead service. SDB II provides the warfighter the capability to attack mobile targets from stand-off, through adverse weather. SDB II addresses the following warfighter requirements: attack moving and stationary targets, adverse weather operations, multiple kills per pass, multiple ordnance carriage, precision munitions capability, reduced munitions footprint, increased weapons effectiveness, minimized potential for collateral damage, reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures and provides a network enabled weapon capability via Link-16 and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Weapon Data Link (WDL). The threshold aircraft for the USAF is the F-15E, and the threshold aircraft for the DoN are the F-35B and F-35C. Objective aircraft include the F-22, F-16, F-35A, B-2, A-10, MQ-9, B-1, B-52, F/A-18 E/F, and AC-130. SDB II will be compatible with the BRU-61 (Bomb Rack Unit) miniature munitions carriage, the Type II carriage system, the CNU-660/E carriage system, the Common Munitions Built-in-Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The SDB II program will develop and field a single weapon storage container (USAF) and a dual weapon container (DoN).

2a. SDB II is an events-driven program. SDB II completed a 42-month competitive Risk Reduction phase in October 2009 and entered the Milestone B Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase in August 2010. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm EMD contract was awarded on 09 August 2010. The SDB II Program received Milestone C approval to enter Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) on 3 June 2015. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm Contract for Lot 1 production of 144 weapons was awarded on 12 June 2015, Lot 2 production contract option for 250 weapons was exercised on 8 September 2016, and Lot 3 production contract option for 312 weapons was exercised on 27 January 2017. An updated Milestone C Acquisition Program Baseline is complete. Developmental Testing (DT), including Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) and Live Fire (LF) test missions is nearing completion. A 28-shot Government Confidence Test program began in FY2016 as part of DT. There are no significant software-related issues with the program at this time. Required Assets Available (RAA) for the F-15E is to be completed in FY2019. The DoN Initial Operational Capability (IOC) on the F-35B and F-35C will occur once all F-35B and F-35C operational testing is completed. SDB II is a key component of the Air Force Global Strike Task Force CONOPs. Department of the Navy first Lot (Lot 4) will support F/A-18E/F Initial Operational Capability. 

Funds may be used to resolve production DMS/MS/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier/parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.

Note: ID Code A is applicable to SDB I only.

            <proc:Description>1. GBU-53/B: Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II) is a joint interest United States Air Force (USAF) and Department of Navy (DoN) ACAT IC program with the USAF as the lead service. SDB II provides the warfighter the capability to attack mobile targets from stand-off, through adverse weather. SDB II addresses the following warfighter requirements: attack moving and stationary targets, adverse weather operations, multiple kills per pass, multiple ordnance carriage, precision munitions capability, reduced munitions footprint, increased weapons effectiveness, minimized potential for collateral damage, reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures and provides a network enabled weapon capability via Link-16 and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Weapon Data Link (WDL). The threshold aircraft for the USAF is the F-15E, and the threshold aircraft for the DoN are the F-35B and F-35C. Objective aircraft include the F-22, F-16, F-35A, B-2, A-10, MQ-9, B-1, B-52, F/A-18 E/F, and AC-130. SDB II will be compatible with the BRU-61 (Bomb Rack Unit) miniature munitions carriage, the Joint Miniature Munitions (JMM) BRU, the CNU-660/E carriage system, the Common Munitions Built-in-Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The SDB II program will develop and field a single weapon storage container (USAF) and a dual weapon container (DoN).

1a. SDB II is an events-driven program. SDB II completed a 42-month competitive Risk Reduction phase in October 2009 and entered the Milestone B Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase in August 2010. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm EMD contract was awarded on 09 August 2010. The SDB II Program received Milestone C approval to enter Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) on 3 June 2015. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm Contract for Lot 1 production of 144 weapons was awarded on 12 June 2015, Lot 2 production contract option for 250 weapons was exercised on 8 September 2016, and Lot 3 production contract option for 312 weapons was exercised on 27 January 2017. An updated Milestone C Acquisition Program Baseline is complete. Developmental Testing (DT), including Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) and Live Fire (LF) test missions is nearing completion. A 28-shot Government Confidence Test program began in FY2016 as part of DT. There are no significant software-related issues with the program at this time. Required Assets Available (RAA) for the F-15E is to be completed in FY2019. The DoN Initial Operational Capability (IOC) on the F-35B and F-35C will occur once all F-35B and F-35C operational testing is completed. SDB II is a key component of the Air Force Global Strike Task Force CONOPs. Department of the Navy first Lot (Lot 4) will support F/A-18E/F Initial Operational Capability.

1b. The total planned SDB II procurement is 17,000 weapons; 12,000 for the AF and 5,000 for the DoN. SDB II total procurement costs in this document only include the 10,771 AF weapons, weapon containers, trainers, reliability captive/test vehicles, tactical to guided test vehicles conversion for WSEP, and associated production support.

Funds may be used to resolve production DMS/MS/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier/parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207327F.

            <proc:Description>Funding for this mod in FY15 ($4.7M) and FY16 ($13.7M) was in PE0101213F, M30MLG, MM III Modifications.

The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will replace the current Mk21/W87 fuze to meet warfighter requirements to support both Minuteman III (MM III) and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The new fuze will be a form, fit, and functionally equivalent replacement for the legacy Mk21/W87 and will provide a 30-year design life. The program will support the current force of 400 deployed and 50 non-deployed ICBMs.

The program will provide needed MM III weapon system modifications, system testing, support/test equipment, data and training required to accommodate, field, and support the new Mk21 fuze along with the W87 warhead as defined in the AFGSC Requirements Traceability Memo dated 2 December 2013. In addition, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) signed the program's JROC Memorandum validating the operational requirement for the program on 6 December 2016. Currently available Mk21/W87 fuze quantities do not meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) requirements and the legacy fuze is three times beyond its original ten year design life. A replacement Mk21/W87 fuze is urgently required to meet warfighter requirements and to ensure operational capability. ICBM Fuze Modernization will procure 693 Mk21/W87 replacement fuzes. Fuzes will be delivered and placed in supply for installation by organizational/intermediate maintenance on a schedule to be determined by USSTRATCOM and Air Force Global Strike Command.

Life of Type Buy
The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will continue acquiring Life-of-Type Buys (LOTB) materials and components through FY19 to support both the Mk21/W87 and future Mk21A/IW1 Life Extension Program (LEP). The Mk21A/IW1 LEP will utilize similar replacement fuze components being developed by the ICBM Fuze Modernization program. Executing LOPB for Mk21A/IW1 LEP ensures this future program can fully leverage the material design, component design, and nuclear certification and qualification activities.

                    <proc:Description>FY15-19 non-recurring costs include Life-of-Type Buys (LOTB) critical to affordably buy qualified Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts for use during and after exposure to nuclear environments and to ensure commonality between the Air Force and the Navy. LOPB will be executed jointly with the Navy to provide a pool of interchangeable, qualified, and certified parts for each service's fuze.  Procured parts will be delivered to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) for use in producing common component modules for the Air Force and Navy fuzes.  Some component modules will be entirely interchangeable between the Services while others will have interchangeable sub assemblies. Pre-production planning activities will begin in FY18, accomplishing three Production Readiness Reviews (PRR) and two Product Definition and Documentation Reviews (PDDR).  The purpose of the PRR is to evaluate the manufacturing system readiness.  The purpose of the PDDR is to ensure the requirements necessary for production are in place and mapped from design to production.

Program Overview
The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will replace the current Mk21/W87 fuze to meet warfighter requirements to support both Minuteman III (MM III) and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The new fuze will be a form, fit, and functionally equivalent replacement for the legacy Mk21/W87 fuze and will provide a 30-year design life. The program will support the current force of 400 deployed and 50 non-deployed ICBMs.

The program will provide needed MM III weapon system modifications, system testing, support/test  equipment, data and training required to accommodate, field, and support the new Mk21 fuze along with the W87 warhead as defined in the AFGSC Requirements Traceability Memo dated 2 December 2013. In addition, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) signed the program's JROC Memorandum validating the operational requirement for the program on 6 December 2016. Currently available Mk21/W87 fuze quantities do not meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) requirements and the legacy fuze is three times beyond its original ten year design life. A replacement Mk21/W87 fuze is urgently required to meet warfighter requirements and to ensure operational capability. ICBM Fuze Modernization will procure 693 Mk21/W87 replacement fuzes. Fuzes will be delivered and placed in supply for installation by organizational/intermediate maintenance on a schedule to be determined by USSTRATCOM and Air Force Global Strike Command.

Life of Type Buy
The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will continue acquiring LOTB materials and components through FY19 to support both the Mk21/W87 and future Mk21A/IW-1 program. The Mk21A/IW-1 program will utilize similar replacement fuze components being developed by the ICBM Fuze Modernization program.  Executing LOTB for Mk21A/IW-1 program ensures this future program can fully leverage the material design, component design, and nuclear certification and qualification activities.

            <proc:Description>This line item funds modifications to the LGM-30, Minuteman III (MM III) Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system. The MM III is a strategic missile capable of delivering special weapons against a wide range of targets. The purpose of the modifications budgeted in FY19 is to support the operational capability of the Minuteman ICBM through 2030. Programs will include analysis of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) risks and procurement activities related to DMSMS.

The modifications being performed on LGM-30 include: Minuteman Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) modification, LGM-30G ICBM Fuze Modernization, LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit (LCCB), LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3), Automatic Switching Unit (ASU), LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II) and LGM-30G T-9 Launch Facility Trainer Conversion.  

Automatic Switching Unit (ASU) is a production new start program in FY19.

Funding for modifications other than MEECN is contained in PE 0101213F (PE 0604851F prior to FY15); MEECN is contained in PE 0303131F.

In FY17 and FY18, ICBM Modernization was transferred to PE0101213F, M30FLH, ICBM Modernization to provide transparency.

Starting in FY19, ICBM Modernization was transferred to PE0101328F, M30FLH, ICBM Modernization to align with new reentry vehicles program element.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The Minuteman Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) Program Upgrade (MMPU) modernizes existing Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Launch Control Center (LCC) Extremely High Frequency (EHF) communications to provide an Advanced EHF (AEHF) capability and a capability for Missile Combat Crew Members to have operator control of the terminal in the LCC to switch between satellites. This upgrade is compatible with AEHF satellite and the supporting key management infrastructure (Crypto Interoperability). AEHF is an Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform that provides more secure transmit/receive at high data rate frequencies than the lower data rate frequencies currently used on Milstar satellites. The AEHF terminal will provide both receive and report-back capability. These modifications comply with USSTRATCOM requirements for strategic terminals to communicate at higher data rates. MMPU includes upgrades to 45 missile wing LCCs and 1 test LCC at Vandenberg AFB, CA; 3 Organizational Maintenance System (OMS) terminals; and 1 test terminal at Hill AFB, UT Space Missile Integration Complex (SMIC). The program also includes modifications to the Missile Procedures Trainers (MPT) and regression testing of fielded systems with AEHF and Milstar satellite and supporting infrastructure. Seven (7) MMP Upgrade terminals were procured for RDT&amp;E purposes and will be upgraded and installed at test and sustainment facilities to support MMPU systems.

Milestone/Development Status

Minuteman MEECN Program Upgrade (MMPU) entered Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) 15 January 2008. Production and Deployment phase began 27 December 2011.  Force Development Evaluation (FDE) was completed on 7 February 2015.  A provisional fielding decision was received on 25 September 2015, then rescinded on 2 May 2016.  Successful OMS installation on 30 March 2016.  System Operational Test (SOT) was successfully completed in October 2017.  Fielding decision approved on 29 December 2017.  Installation of the operational LCCs begins in FY18 with Initial Operational Capability (IOC) planned for 1QFY19.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>LGM-30G MM Crypto Mods / ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) procures and fields upgraded A4 Drawers that implement KS-60 remote key/code change, irreversible transformation and continuous signal lockout capabilities that increases code security and prevents widespread loss of status monitoring.  Cryptography modifications will increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually while reducing associated labor costs.

FY18 included support equipment required for operational units and the depot repair facility to perform fault isolation, component replacement, and functional testing.

Milestone/Development Status

ICU II Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development has been ongoing since FY13.  In FY16, ICU II was restructured to address an emerging supply chain requirement.  ICU II testing with the initial integrated circuit solution (Field Programmable Gate Array - FPGA) has been completed and identified several issues requiring additional development.  Follow-on testing for the integrated circuit solution (Application Specific Integrated Circuit - ASIC) will continue through Jul 18.

Key development activities include:

                    <proc:Description>The LCCBU program will address several elements within the Launch Control Center (LCC) that are experiencing supportability issues and negatively impacting voice communications in the MM missile fields. Components will be procured as a single modification kit and installed as a single kit at each LCC. It will consist of five primary replacement efforts: 

1) Journal Memory Loader (JML) - replaces the JML with a modern data storage solution which will increase the available memory required to support annual software changes and mitigate Floppy Disk obsolescence concerns. 
2) Floppy Disk Drive (FDD) - replaces the legacy FDDs which are no longer manufactured with a modern, supportable hardware solution. 
3) Voice Communications Control Panel (VCCP) - replaces the current deficient communication equipment to provide the voice communications quality required to perform the ICBM mission. 
4) Weapon System Control Console (WSCC) Printer - replaces the current printer that is no longer produced and is unsupportable due to aging hardware and a lack of qualified vendors for replacement/repair components. 
5) Oxygen Regeneration Unit (ORU) - replaces the current unsupportable system to provide the crew with breathable air during periods when the LCC is locked down. All LCCBU efforts will support the 45 operational LCCs and additional support equipment/test/maintenance locations.

All LCCBU efforts will support the 45 operational LCCs and additional test/maintenance/training locations.
RDT&amp;E efforts are included in PE 0101213F. Development for applicable components will begin in FY15 and transition to production in FY19.

                    <proc:Description>This program, P-3A Mod 5925, MM III Auto Switching Unit (ASU) , is a new start.
 The ASU Program will replace the obsolete Auto Switching Unit, Diesel Electric Unit, and Minuteman Power Processor with modern COTS components to improve reliability and supportability.  All Launch Facilities and Missile Alert Facilities will be impacted by this program at all missile wings. The ASU program will also modify Minuteman trainers and facilities at Vandenberg. The new equipment is expected to have a design life of 10 years and will replace equipment that has exceeded its original design life.

                    <proc:Description>LGM-30G T-9 Modification (T-9) modifies the Launch Facility (LF) trainer at Malmstrom AFB to match the current Minuteman configuration necessary to support maintenance training for Missile, Facilities and Electro-mechanical Maintenance Team technicians. The T-9 modification will reduce reliance on workarounds using non-training LF assets improving efficiency and reducing costs related to training. Required modifications will be performed by contractor, organizational, and intermediate maintenance teams.

                    <proc:Description>The LGM-30G RVA II program will provide the following capabilities: situational awareness for both ground and airborne security forces; increasing cybersecurity posture; adding video archival capability; providing additional backup power; and complementing the existing security intrusion detection systems located on each LF - Improved Minuteman Physical Security System (IMPSS) alarm.

The RVA system consists of real-time video surveillance, display, and data transmission elements. During an intrusion, this system works in conjunction with the existing nuclear-certified intrusion detection system to report LF assessment information to monitoring locations.

                    <proc:Description>LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination (FT3), will replace the current Instrumentation Wafer and Flight Destruct System (FDS) capability, and modify the Launch Support System (LSS), used during MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs). The current system is becoming unsupportable and does not meet updated Range Safety Standards as directed in Range Commanders Council (RCC) 319 and RCC 324. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) approved the AF Form 1067 for the instrumentation wafer in Jan 2014 and the AF Form 1067 for LSS/FDS in Jan 2015.

The Instrumentation Wafer and FDS replace the currently unsupportable Mod 7 wafer and Automated Ordnance Destruct System prior to supplies becoming exhausted in FY19.  LSS replaces the current unique, specialized test system at Vandenberg AFB used to monitor and control test launch flights and ground support equipment.  The current LSS is experiencing supportability issues with failure trends increasing due to hardware aging and obsolescence.  A new LSS is required to field the Instrumentation Wafer and the FDS.  All capabilities must be replaced to continue MM III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Milestone/Development Status

In FY14, development was initiated under the Instrumentation Wafer Replacement Program (within PE 0604851F).  In FY15, capability for the Flight Destruct System and Launch Support System were added to provide a full FT3 capability.

Full development for FT3 use on MM III OTLs began in FY15 and will continue through transition of the instrumentation wafer and flight destruct capabilities into procurement and delivery of the launch support system capability.

                    <proc:Description>FY17-21 funding related to this effort has been transferred to PE 0101213F, M30FLH, ICBM Fuze Mod, to provide transparency.

FY15-16 non-recurring costs included Life-of-Program Buys critical to affordably buy qualified Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts for use during and after exposure to nuclear environments and to ensure commonality between the Air Force and the Navy. The purchase of COTS parts will be executed jointly with the Navy to provide a pool of interchangeable, qualified, and certified parts for each service's ballistic missile weapon system. Procured parts will be delivered to the National Nuclear Security Agency's  National Security Campus (NSC) in Kansas City  for use in producing common component modules for the Air Force and Navy fuzes. Some component modules will be entirely interchangeable between the Services while others will have interchangeable subassemblies.

Milestone/Development Status

This program is tailored to use the joint DoD-DOE Phase 6.X processes for routine nuclear stockpile activities to align with Navy and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) operations.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The ADSR program designs, develops, fabricates and tests replacements for the aging Arm/Disarm (A/D) switches currently on the MM III Missile fleet.  The A/D switch is responsible for completing or interrupting ordnance electrical circuits.  A/D switches are placed at five key locations in the system: Inter-stage I-II, Stage II Liquid Injection Thrust Vector Control (LITVC) and Roll Control, Inter-stage II-III, PSRE Staging, and PSRE Isolation Valves.  Aging and surveillance is an ongoing study to generate a tradeoff curve between reliability/availability and cost.  Reliability/availability are monitored by periodic testing to discover unforeseen issues.  Because all existing A/D switches cannot be repaired/refurbished, the number in inventory will eventually be inadequate to meet the need of the PDM cycle.  Supply is estimated to deplete by approximately FY24 with repair/refurbish mitigation.  Repair/refurbish is a reliable mitigation plan to meet the ongoing needs of the fleet while a manufacturer is selected and the manufacturing system is selected to develop a replacement A/D switch that meets requirements and PDM production quantities. ADSR is required to continue Booster and PSRE PDMs through 2036.

            <proc:Description>FY17 funding totals include $26.620M requested for Overseas Contingency Operations to fund the modification of 302 legacy AGM-65 Maverick missiles to Laser Maverick missiles.

FY18 funding totals include $10.000M requested for Overseas Contingency Operations to fund the modification of 91 legacy AGM-65 Maverick missiles to Laser Maverick missiles.

AGM-65L is the Air Force Laser Maverick missile that aids in striking moving targets traveling at high velocities with proven accuracy and low collateral damage. The missile is a modification of inventory baseline Maverick missiles. The AGM-65L Maverick missiles replaced electro-optical TV seeker components with new Semi-Active Laser (SAL) components. The AGM-65A/B Guidance Control System (GCS) is modified to Laser which is the "L" variant. For the backend, the AGM-65G Center Aft Section (CAS) mates with the laser GCS for a tactical All-up Round (AUR) laser missile. The modification program is with Raytheon Missile Systems.  Additional baseline Maverick missiles will be modified to Laser Maverick missiles with accrued Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exchange credits. Funding also covers the movement of Maverick GCS units (AGM-65A/B/G) between the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant &amp; Raytheon Missile Systems (Tucson, AZ). The older Maverick GCS units are upgraded/modified to Laser Maverick seekers. 

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>AGM-65L is the Air Force Laser Maverick missile that aids in striking moving targets traveling at high velocities with proven accuracy and low collateral damage. The missile is a modification of inventory baseline Maverick missiles and responds to an Air Combat Command modification proposal requirement (AF1067) approved on 16 Aug 07.  The AGM-65L Maverick missiles replaced electro-optical TV seeker components with new Semi-Active Laser (SAL) components. The AGM-65A/B Guidance Control System (GCS) is modified to Laser which is the "L" variant. For the backend, the AGM-65G Center Aft Section (CAS) mates with the laser GCS for a tactical All-up Round (AUR) laser missile. The modification program is with Raytheon Missile Systems. Additional baseline Maverick missiles will be modified to Laser Maverick missiles with accrued Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exchange credits. Funding also covers the movement of Maverick GCS units (AGM-65A/B/G) between the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant &amp; Raytheon Missile Systems (Tucson, AZ). The older Maverick GCS units are upgraded/modified to Laser Maverick seekers. 

The FY19 Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) request will fund the modification of 293 legacy AGM-65 Maverick missiles to Laser Maverick missiles.  Missile modifications will replenish the Laser Maverick missiles expended in combat operations.

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.

                    <proc:Description>In FY19, the program segregated the SLEP 2 components Guided Missile Flight Controller (GFMC), Rotary Switch (RS), and Warhead Arming Device (WAD) into separate efforts. Ref AGM-86B Service Life Extension Program (SLEP-2) modification number 860002 for prior years information.

AF Long Range Planning required the service life of the ALCM to be extended through 2030. In order to satisfy the life extension requirement, several phases of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) were implemented, a proactive approach. Through studies and surveillance and analysis programs, various components were identified as candidates for replacement due to aging and obsolescence issues before they become fleet-wide problems. Up to 24 SLEP WAD kits per year will be delivered to the depot for installation in conjunction with Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) missiles. The remaining SLEP WAD kits will be delivered to the organizational-level maintenance units for installation via Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) in conjunction with scheduled maintenance activities.  Service life extension of this critical weapon is essential to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) and United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) operational needs.   

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

In 2015, AFGSC updated requirements to move 14 missiles from attrition reserve to the active fleet.  An additional 14 kits will be procured in FY20 to fulfill this requirement.

SLEP funds will continue to support AFGSC and USSTRATCOM requirements to keep the ALCM viable through 2030

In March 2017, Boeing Guidance and Repair Center (BGRC) recalled 90 WADs due to quality defect for rework. This is a firm fixed price (FFP) contract, no change in contract price.  Government has approved BGRC Recovery Plan and deliveries resumed June 2017.  Installations delayed until Jul 2017, thereby extending installation completion into FY2023.

Milestone/Development Status

Engineering studies and analysis programs identified SLEP components for replacement due to aging and obsolescence issues.  Solutions to these aging and obsolescence issues were identified through engineering studies conducted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>In FY19, the program segregated the SLEP 2 components Guided Missile Flight Controller (GFMC), Rotary Switch (RS), and Warhead Arming Device (WAD) into separate efforts. Ref AGM-86B Service Life Extension Program (SLEP-2) modification number 860002 for prior years information.

AF Long Range Planning required the service life of the ALCM to be extended through 2030.  In order to satisfy the life extension requirement, several phases of the service Life Extension program (SLEP) were implemented as a proactive approach.  Through studies and surveillance and analysis programs, various components were identified as candidates for replacement due to aging and obsolescence issues before they become fleet-wide problems.  This modification executes a remanufacture of the RS.  The RS kit will be issued via a Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO).  The remanufactured RS will be available for installation at Hill AFB, Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) at an annual rate of 24 kits.  The RS TCTO kit will also be available to the organizational-level maintenance units for installation at a rate of 70 per year in conjunction with scheduled maintenance activities.  This effort is critical to meet Air Florce Global Strike Command (AFGSC) and Unites States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) operational needs.  Installations are expected to occur FY20-FY26.  RS will be done in phases: 1)Remanufacture Plan, 2) Remanufacture Readiness, 3)Production.  

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.  

In 2015, AFGSC updated requirements to move 14 missiles from attrition reserve to the active fleet.  An additional 14 kits will be procured in FY24 to fulfill the requirement.  

SLEP funds will continue to support AFGSC and USSTRATCOM requirements to keep the ALCM viable through 2030.

Milestone/Development Status

Engineering studies and analysis programs identified SLEP components for replacement due to aging and obsolescence issues.  Solutions to these aging and obsolescence issues were identified through engineering studies conducted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>In FY19, the program segregated the SLEP 2 components Guided Missile Flight Controller (GFMC), Rotary Switch (RS), and Warhead Arming Device (WAD) into separate efforts. Ref AGM-86B Service Life Extension Program (SLEP-2) modification number 860002 for prior years information.

AF Long Range Planning required the service life of the ALCM to be extended through 2030. In order to satisfy the life extension requirement, several phases of the Service Life Extension program (SLEP) were implemented, a proactive approach. Through studies and surveillance and analysis programs, various components were identified as candidates for replacement due to aging and obsolescence issues before they become fleet-wide problems.  This modification executes a remanufacture of the GMFC. The GMFC kit will be issued via a Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO). The remanufactured GMFC TCTO will be available for installation at Hill AFB, Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI)at an annual rate of 24 kits. The GMFC TCTO kit will also be available to the organizational-level maintenance units for installation at a rate of 70 per year in conjunction with scheduled maintenance activities. This effort is critical to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) and United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) operational needs. Installations are expected to occur FY21-FY26. GMFC will be done in three phases: 1)Remanufacture Plan, 2)Remanufacture Readiness, 3)Production. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. 

In 2015, AFGSC updated requirements to move 14 missiles from attrition reserve to the active fleet. An additional 14 kits will be procured in FY26 to fulfill the requirement. 

SLEP funds will continue to support AFGSC and USSTRATCOM requirements to keep the ALCM viable through 2030.

Milestone/Development Status

Engineering studies and analysis programs identified SLEP components for replacement due to aging and obsolescence issues.  Solutions to these aging and obsolescence issues were identified through engineering studies conducted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>GBU-39/B: Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I) is a weapon system that provides fighter and bomber aircraft with a tactically significant standoff attack or direct attack/close air support capability from outside point defenses, against fixed/stationary targets. The SDB I weapon system consists of a 250-pound class weapon, a 4-place common carriage system, logistics support and mission planning module. The FY2018 modifications are to the bomb rack unit (BRU-61/A) carriages. This modification adds capability to operate on 270 volts direct current (VDC) aircraft power in addition to the current configuration of 115 volts alternating current (VAC) capability. This will reduce risk to F-35A integration of SDB I and provide future aircraft loadout options to the inventory carriages. It will also increase weapon loadout by 200% and provide risk reduction for future SDB II integration. The original procurement of BRU-61/As was 2,000. This effort will procure 245 dual power modification kits. The BRU-61/A carriage requirement document is the Combat Air Forces Operational Requirements Document 304-97-C-A for Miniature Munitions and Carriage System dated April 2005.

Funds may be used to resolve production DMS/MS/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier/parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.

            <proc:Description>Missile Initial Spares (Budget Program 26) and Replenishment Spares (Budget Program 25)

Program Description: MISSILE INITIAL SPARES (Budget Program 26).  Missile Initial Spares are required to fill the initial spare parts pipeline or inventory for all new ballistic and non-ballistic  missile systems, including modifications, support equipment, and other production categories.  Initial spares include peculiar reparable and consumable components, assemblies, and subassemblies that must be available for issue at all levels of supply in time to support and maintain newly fielded end items.  

Initial spares are funded in the two program segments described below.

Working Capital Fund (WCF) Spares.  Since FY94 most spares are purchased using obligation authority in the WCF.  When the spares are delivered, this central procurement account reimburses the WCF.  Types of spares in this program segment are Readiness Spares Packages, New Acquisition Spares, Modification Spares, Support Equipment, Other Production, and Consumables.

Exempt Spares.  This program segment finances spares that are not purchased through the WCF.  The budget authority is a direct cite on the contract.  Types of spares in this program segment are Contractor Logistics Support, Simulators/Trainers, Classified Equipment, and Munitions.

Program Description: MISSILE REPLENISHMENT SPARES (Budget Program 25).  The Missile Replenishment Spares program funds all ballistic and non-ballistic missile replenishment spares.  The replenishment and repair spare parts are needed to support and maintain ballistic and non-ballistic missile systems.  Replenishment spares include such items as rocket motors, cables, telemetry packages, and electronic components.  Procurements will include spares with long production lead items.

The following Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) have funding in this line:

AMRAAM, 185
SDB II, 439
AIM-9X Blk II, 442
JASSM, 555

This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PEs 11120F, 11213F, 27161F, 11122F, and 27163F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Missile Initial spares will be used to fill the intial spare parts needed to support the Flight Test Telemetry and Termination Systems (FT3) and the ICBM Cryptography Upgrade (ICU II) programs. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Missile Initial Spares program funds all Minuteman III initial spares. The repair spare parts are needed to support and maintain Minuteman III missile system. Initial spares are needed to support the major sub systems of the weapon systems including the Re-entry System, Re-entry Vehicle, Guidance System, Propulsion System, Launch Facility and Launch Command Center.  This includes items such as batteries, ordnance, cables, telemetry packages, and electronic components.

AIM-9/AIM-9X:  The Missile Initial Spares program funds depot level post warranty repairs and procures initial spares for all variants.  These spares are essential for repairs that do not have parts available. The Missile Replenishment Spares program funds repairs for CATMs and AURs. These repairs include items such as live and inert batteries, Control Actuation System (CAS) and Inert Measurement Units.

AMRAAM:  The Missile Initial Spares program funds depot level post warranty repairs.  The Missile Replenishment Spares program funds AMRAAM field unit repairs and intermediate level repairs on Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM). These repairs include such items as filter rectifiers, harness assemblies, wings and fins.

JASSM:  The missile initial spares program funds are required to fill the initial spare parts pipeline and replenishment/repair spare parts under the contractor logistic support program.  These parts include items such as cables, telemetry packages, and electronic components to support and maintain fielded end items.  These spares meet Air Combat Command's bed-down plans for JASSM.

AGM-88A (HARM):  The Missile Replenishment Spares program funds all HARM replenishment spares parts are needed to support and maintain the HARM weapon system. The Missile Replenishment Spares program procures parts required for depot level repairs that are necessary to sustain HARM.  This includes items such as wing dampers, telemetry kits, batteries and fuzes.

AGM-65D Maverick:  The Missile Replenishment Spares program procures telemetry kits for annual reliability testing to ensure inventory health and warfighter readiness.  These funds also support limited procurement of obsolete components in launcher assemblies, missile guidance sections and test support equipment essential to maintain the Maverick Weapon System.

Hellfire:  The Missile Replenishment spares funding supports repair and replacement of Hellfire parts not covered by warranty.

Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I):  The Missile Replenishment Spares program supports procurement of flight termination and telemetry kits to covert GBU-39/B's into SDB I Guided Test Vehicles for the Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP).

AGM-86 (ALCM):  The missile replenishment spares program funds support and maintain the ALCM service life extension program components. Spares funding for ALCM currently includes the fuze assembly and related parts.</proc:Justification>

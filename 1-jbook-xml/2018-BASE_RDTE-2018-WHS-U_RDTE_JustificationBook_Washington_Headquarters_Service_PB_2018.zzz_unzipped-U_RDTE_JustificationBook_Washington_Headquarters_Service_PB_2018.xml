            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) transfer from OSD (PE 0602230D8Z) to WHS - (Non-Management Headquarters)

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) relies on innovation to maintain our nation’s ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict.  Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) increases the Department’s access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter.  Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIUx is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include “non-traditional” companies that never imagined the military as a potential customer, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their tremendous talents on the vital and difficult mission of our nation’s defense.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was established in April 2015 and DIUx 2.0 in May 2016.  

DIUx mission is to accelerate innovation the majority of which resides in the commercially- focused technology sector to the warfighter.  Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, (USD, AT&amp;L) when it was established in July 2015.  In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the operational control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) with a functional realignment of $148.8 million across the FYDP to WHS.

DIUx funds the acquisition and/or prototyping of leading-edge technologies from commercially-focused companies (i.e., “non-traditionals”) from Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and across the country; as well as from traditional defense contractors that either partner with non-traditionals or offer one-third in cost sharing.  DIUx acquires and/or prototypes these commercially viable technologies solutions, in direct response to particular capability gaps faced by our nation’s warfighters.  As such, solution proposals are assessed to ensure alignment with DoD’s strategic objectives to increase and strengthen our nation’s security.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

* Project BE5 Personnel &amp; Airdrop Safety Advanced Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates equipment and innovative techniques for precision aerial delivery of cargo and personnel. Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.

Work in this Project is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology) and supports Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) and manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) operational concepts by demonstrating precision aerial delivery and airdrop from non-traditional platforms.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates advanced medical technologies including drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic devices, measures for identification and vector control, and developing medical practices and procedures to effectively protect and improve the survivability of United States Forces across the entire spectrum of military operations. Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.  Starting in Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), the principal area of Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine is replaced with the area of Medical Assist Support Technologies.

Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for human medical products, and environmental protection agency (EPA) regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides). The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small group human study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct safety and effectiveness clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large pivotal trials in diverse populations will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and small safety and effectiveness studies involving humans according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA or EPA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.

Blast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center. This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by: the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), Fort Detrick, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 this Project is being realigned to the following Projects within this Program Element (PE):
*	MM9 Tech Base/Enabling Rsrch for Infect Dis Adv Tech
*	MN8 Drugs to Prevent and Treat Malaria Advanced Tech
*	MO9 Vaccines to Prevent Dengue Fever Advanced Tech</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project maturates and demonstrates United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic (identification of the nature and cause of a particular disease) systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases that are threats to deployed United States military forces. The focus of the Project is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This Project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this Project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from arthropods to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Research conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:

(1)	Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases
(2)	Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3)	Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4)	Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control

Research is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).

Work is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A (Medical Systems - Adv Dev), Project 808 (DoD Drug &amp; Vacc Ad).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY20 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Work in this Project is performed by USAMRDC at Fort Detrick, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Studies have shown that the malaria parasite can become resistant to existing drugs, which makes it necessary to continually develop new and more effective and safe treatments. This effort selects candidate vaccines for various types of malaria, including the severe form of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (Plasmodium vivax), prepares technical data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans, and conducts testing of promising malaria vaccine candidates in humans. A malaria vaccine would minimize the progression and impact of drug resistance and eliminate the need to take preventive anti-malarial drugs.</r2:Description>

This tool will use machine learning and predictive analytic techniques to infer the patient's condition based on diverse sources of information (e.g. sensor data, medic observations, etc.) and provide recommendations based on established care guidelines.  It will mature and demonstrate a tele-monitored and remote-controlled medical module to support medical resupply and casualty evacuation. The medical module will be optimized to be self-contained and provide a "roll-on, roll-off" medical capability to future multi-purpose Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).

Program Element (PE) 0603466A Air and Missile Defense Advanced Technology
* Project AD1 High Energy Laser Tactical Vehicle Demo Adv Tech</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates advanced technologies for future High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons technology. The major effort under this Project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon. SSL technology has demonstrated the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges. HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance. This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and validates applied behavioral and social science technologies that enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g. unit cohesion). These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, assignment methods, and performance metrics for individuals and units, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Work in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.

Work in this PE complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602785A (Manpower/Personnel/Training Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Vision, the Army's Talent Management Strategy, and the Army Modernization Strategy

Work in this PE is performed by the United States Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft. Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) this is a New Start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Military Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Research Program develops vaccine candidates, to assess their safety and effectiveness in human subjects, and to protect military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection. All HIV technology development is conducted in compliance with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement between the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The cited work is also consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas.

The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Vaccine Pilot Bioproduction Facility (PBF) is the Department of Defense (DOD) only facility capable of producing good manufacturing practices (GMP) quality biologic products for use in early phase clinical trials. The mission of the WRAIR PBF is to support the development and licensure of vaccines and relevant biologics critical to the global health of our Warfighters serving domestically or abroad in compliance with United States FDA regulations. This project supports vaccine development efforts of strategic importance to the DoD, including Service medical research and development programs, those of other DoD organization such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and pandemic bio preparedness for emerging infectious disease threats in the Global Health Security Agenda.

The Underbody Blast (UBB) Testing medical research project will provide new data on the biomechanics of human skeletal response that occurs in an attack on a ground combat vehicle, it will provide better protection to mounted warriors from the effects of underbody blast caused by landmines or improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The data will provide a biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin (the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin or WIAMan project) and the required biomedically-valid injury criteria that can be used in Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) to characterize dynamic events, the risk of injury to mounted warriors, and to support acquisition decisions. The data produced by this project will be used to satisfy a critical need for a scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB.

The Deployed Warfighter Protection project, the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB), plans to develop new or improved protection for ground forces from disease-carrying insects. The focus of this program is to develop new or improved systems for controlling insects that transmit malaria, dengue, chikungunya and other emerging infectious diseases under austere, remote, and combat conditions; understand the physiology of insecticidal activity to develop new compounds with greater specific activity and/or higher user acceptability; examine existing area repellents for efficacy and develop new spatially effective repellent systems useful in military situations; develop new methods or formulations for treating cloth to prevent vector biting; and expand the number of active ingredients and formulations of public health pest pesticides, products and application technologies available for safe, and effective applications. The AFPMB partners with the President's Malaria Initiative and the World Health Organization Global Malaria Program to lead development of new tools for insect-borne disease prevention.

The Medical Operational Data System (MODS) deploys modernized data visualization capabilities to enhance Army Unit and Individual Medical Readiness Reporting. MODS provides Army leadership with a responsive and reliable human resource and readiness information management data system for all categories of military and civilian medical and support personnel. MODS provide Tri-Service support through applications such as Electronic Profile, Behavioral Health, and Medical Education.

The Pharmacovigilance Defense Application System (PVDAS) provides military providers Defense Patient Safety reports from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after a drug's release to market. The program identifies, explores, and demonstrates key information technologies to overcome medical and military unique technology barriers. 

The Mobile HealthCare Environment (MHCE) is the capability of secure, bidirectional messaging and data exchange between patients, providers and clinics using any electronic device. The program identifies, explores, and demonstrates key information technologies to overcome medical and military unique technology barriers.

The Civilian Authorized Salaries and Other Operational requirements provide funding for authorized civilian workforce performing medical research, development, acquisition management and oversight that support the medical research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) programs at the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, Maryland.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 this Program Element (PE) was previously funded, with continuity of effort realigned from the following PEs:
* 0603001A Warfighter Advanced Technology
* 0603004A Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology
* 0603015A Next Generation Training &amp; Simulation Systems

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE matures and demonstrates Soldier Lethality technologies that improve Soldier operational performance by increasing lethality, mobility, protection, and optimizing situational awareness across the spectrum of operating environments and missions. This PE matures Soldier weapons and enabling components / subsystems, demonstrates lethal weapons systems with potential to provide greater lethality, target acquisition, fire control, and range at a significantly reduced weight for optimized Soldier and Small Unit system performance. The major focus areas for Soldier Lethality Science and Technology are Soldier weapons and ammunition technologies, protection technologies, cognitive and physical performance measures, training in synthetic training environments, and mission support capabilities such as situational awareness sensors and displays, dismounted power and energy technologies, and Soldier and Small Unit sustainment capabilities. This technology diverse PE also matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage all targets and threats at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments), and for advancing live training technologies that accurately replicate and realistically represent the effects of current and future weapons systems during force-on-force and force-on-target training. This PE matures and demonstrates effective technology in personal combat clothing, protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear, combat rations, shelters, logistical support items for aerial delivery of personnel and cargo, and energy systems to power current and emerging Soldier-born ISR, sensor, optical, and communication systems with the least weight and sustainment burden on the Soldiers and Small Combat Units. This PE matures and demonstrates technologies supporting the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE), a single, interconnected synthetic training system that will enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon / multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. A specific research thrust area is applying systems-based practices to mature and demonstrate scientific and tailored knowledge of Soldiers' physical and cognitive architecture to facilitate rapid and efficient designs, assessments and trade-off analyses of technology insertions on the Soldier. Significant S&amp;T investments are directed to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes while reducing the size and weight of the form factor of the equipment.

Work in this PE complements PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology).

All FY21 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

* Project J50 Future Warrior Technology Integration</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project demonstrates optimized Warfighting function (e.g. shoot, move, perceive, decide, and communicate) with Soldier centric technologies, systems and/or subsystems designed to augment Soldier ability during missions. This Project capitalizes on operational partnerships by providing Science and Engineering subject matter experts (SMEs) the ability to assist Commanders in course of action development for potential near term solutions and condition setting for mid/far term science objectives. Provides Soldier assessments to optimize, improve performance, validate and integrate technologies and methodologies with users. Research focuses on the Warfighter as the capability and will rapidly iterate user driven solutions that maximize their tactical performance. This Project also matures and demonstrates Soldier centric technologies for the Soldier/Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT) to support the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE). The STE is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units where they will fight, with whom they will fight with, and in complex operational environments to include dense urban and sub-terrain; within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi-Domain Operations. The S/SVT system combines and integrates several individual Soldier and Squad training capabilities, STE Squad Capability (SSC), Weapon Skill Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF), into a single capability that can be conducted simultaneously or individually and enable physical movement/exertion related to the execution of Soldier/Marine individual and Squad collective training tasks. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.  

This Project is fully coordinated with work done in PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) as well as work conducted by Medical Research &amp; Development Command (MRDC), Army Research Institute (ARI), U.S. Military Academy (USMA), and other academic and industry partners. This work is in partnership with Forces Command (FORSCOM) operational units and the appropriate Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) organizations as well as established transition partners, including Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) &amp; Program Executive Offices.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project integrates research, theory and applied operations to maximize effectiveness of Soldiers and their equipment. Efforts in this Project support early application of Human Systems Integration (HSI) during Advanced Technology Development by translating research findings into performance-based prototype subsystem, component, and software interface design criteria for use in the Army's requirements definition process and materiel acquisition process for Army Modernization. Application of this work will yield reduced workload, fewer errors, reduced task times, enhanced Soldier protection, user acceptance, and allow the Soldier to extract maximum performance from the equipment. Representative major efforts address Soldier cognitive load and cognitive fusion research, advanced aircraft design to include flight in degraded visual environments, and development of human performance measures and methods to address current and future human system integration challenges. Individual efforts exploit adaptive learning methods and strategies, applied methods to accelerate expertise development, integration of displays for ease of use and optimized situational awareness, and development of technical frameworks for crew automation integration in Command and Control Systems (C2). Efforts also support flight crew decision-aiding and autonomy, advanced crew station design for aircraft, full mission operations in degraded visual environments, and advanced manned-unmanned teaming concepts.

Results of these efforts are transitioned to the Program Executive Offices (PEO), Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). This Project complements work done in PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) / Project BC3 (Soldier Decision Making &amp; Communications Performance Technology).

Program Element (PE) 0603115A Next Generation Training &amp; Simulation Systems:
* Project S29 Modeling &amp; Simulation - Advanced Technology Development
* Project S31 Modeling And Simulation Infrastructure Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates technologies supporting the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE).  The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units where they will fight, with whom they will fight with, and in complex operational environments to include dense urban and sub-terrain; within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi- Domain Operations. STE Information Systems (STE-IS) delivers the Common Synthetic Environment consisting of Global Terrain/One World Terrain (OWT), Training Simulation Software (TSS), and Training Management Tools (TMT). The STE will be available where training occurs (home station, combat training centers, armories, institutions, shipboard, deployed) and will include Air and Ground Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers (RVCTs), a Soldier/Squad Virtual Training (S/SVT), and a live training capability. The STE will be cloud-enabled, compatible with the Army Enterprise Network, and service-based through the Common Operating Environment, including Live and Constructive. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.  

This Project complements work done in PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) / Project BE8 (Synthetic Training Environment (STE) Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the STE Cross Functional Team efforts.

This Project is a New Start for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project develops technology for detecting and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The goal of this research is to increase the ability of deployed forces to positively identify IEDs with minimal false alarms and increase the rate of advance of deployed forces as well as to identify vehicle and personnel borne IEDs at fixed sites.  Additionally the objective is to positively neutralize or mitigate the effects of IEDs with minimal collateral damage.

                                <r2:Description>This effort develops technology to detect IED threats at standoff distances.  Technologies include electro-optical, radar, light range and distance (LIDAR), atomic magnetometer and other technologies applicable to detecting IEDs and their components that can be integrated on dismounted Soldiers, ground, water-based and aerial systems or at fixed sites.  This effort also develops technologies and network techniques to detect the electronic signature of radio-controlled IEDs.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) addresses the supercomputing requirements of Department of Defense (DoD) scientists and engineers by: (1) demonstrating and maturing the most advanced, leading-edge computational architectures while exploiting the resulting systems by employing complementary specialized expertise; (2) demonstrating and maturing the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), which investigates, demonstrates, and matures leading-edge digital networking and security technologies to securely deliver computational capabilities to the distributed DoD Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) community; and (3) leveraging specialized expertise from DoD, other federal departments and agencies, industry, and academia to demonstrate and mature leading-edge software application codes. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive computational capabilities to demonstrate and mature emerging technologies that address the supercomputing requirements of the DoD RDTE community in the areas of hardware, software, and programming environments. All HPCMP sites are interconnected to each other, the DoD High Performance Computing (HPC) RDTE community, and other major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which investigates, demonstrates, and matures (a) state-of-the-art digital networking technologies to ensure a robust distributed environment and (b) the most advanced digital security capabilities to protect the intellectual property of the DoD and its contract entities as they employ HPCMP capabilities. The HPCMP's software application effort (a) optimizes, enhances, demonstrates, and matures critical DoD physics-based and engineering software to allow scientists and engineers to execute calculations with precision and efficiency on leading-edge supercomputers, (b) demonstrates and matures immersive collaborative programming environments to improve science and engineering workflows, and (c) demonstrates and matures leading-edge computational technology from academia and industry. These synergistic activities collectively demonstrate and mature horizontal technologies that are exploited across the DoD RDTE community, ensuring the DoD maintains the most advanced research and development ecosystem in computationally-intensive modeling and design.

For fixed-wing aircraft, this included, but was not be limited to, high-fidelity physics-based analysis capabilities for coupled aerodynamics, structural dynamics, propulsion, and flight controls in support of flight certifications (e.g., air worthiness, store carriage and release, etc.), mission planning for fielded and new systems and associated upgrades, and acquisition decisions associated with exploration and design analysis of future manned and unmanned aerial vehicle concepts. Additionally, it included implementation of foundational software improvements necessary to begin development of physics-based design analysis tools for future hypersonic weapon systems (High Speed Strike, Tactical Boost-Glide, and Manned/Unmanned Conventional Prompt Global Strike). For rotorcraft, exemplars included aeromechanics analysis associated with maneuvers, airframe-propulsion system integration, and weapons carriage and release, as well as infrared suppression analysis, chaff trajectory prediction, debris ingestion analysis, and loads prediction capability necessary for structural airworthiness assessments. These capabilities were deployed in support of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Program, as well as for sustainment of existing rotorcraft-based programs and associated upgrades. For RF antenna design analysis, further matured computational electromagnetics capabilities to assist in design and evaluation of next generation radar for aircraft, ships, and ground-based platforms; demonstrated capability for assessment of electromagnetic hazards on ordnance and will optimize computational methods for electronic warfare assessments and evaluation of multiple antenna systems on a single platform. For Naval Ships (surface and submarine), further matured conceptual and early modeling capabilities in sync with detailed design and analyses, to realize full-lifecycle management of systems and platforms, and for conducting AoAs.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enables the Defense Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly, and with more precision, using advanced, physics-based computer simulation supported by high performance computing (HPC) technology. The computational expertise and resources enable Department of Defense (DoD) personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state-of-the-art computer network technologies. The Software Application effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Autonomous Ground Resupply (AGR) will mature and demonstrate an improved ground supply distribution system across multiple levels of strategic and tactical sustainment operations. The effort will equip existing military ground vehicles with scalable robotic technology through the integration of modular kits, common interfaces, and a common architecture to improve inter-node supply movement. Further, the system will modernize and optimize the operations within the supply nodes to improve accountability and throughput. The objective of AGR is to integrate new and emerging technologies into the Army's sustainment system to improve throughput, accountability, and safety and provide the Warfighter with the flexibility needed to meet future needs.

The work under this Project will transition to the Leader Follower Program of Record (PoR). The architecture and safety work under this Project also lays the groundwork for the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV).

This Project matures and demonstrates simulation tools that predict autonomous vehicle performance. This Project matures and demonstrates a real-time simulator that provides the ability to design and assess ground vehicle autonomous behaviors in adverse environmental conditions, reducing the need for field testing. These simulation technologies can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware such as computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command/control/driving mechanisms as well as vehicle software to enhance crew performance, increase vehicle fuel efficiency, reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) burdens and reduce vehicle maintenance costs. This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture approach provides an open architecture such as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance / Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), to allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures infrastructure that enables the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test/evaluation.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies to increase autonomy and mobility to perform teamed operations with manned and unmanned air and ground vehicles in a military relevant environment through data collection on relevant platforms. Data collection will involve both simulation and live collection. Simulation will provide a baseline to correctly collect, clean, and analyze data that meets the need for improving algorithms for both formation control and unmanned aerial vehicle map input for unmanned ground vehicle mobility. Live data will start with Surrogate platforms in local areas. This will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligent methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI/ML techniques to mature and demonstrate intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for GPS. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to improve algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI/ML techniques to optimize intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) mapped areas. Data collected from air vehicle will be converted to maneuverable information for unmanned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20) this Program Element (PE) was realigned with continuity of effort to the following PEs:
* PE 0603118A Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology 
* PE 0603462A Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology
* PE 0603463A Network C3I Advanced Technology
* PE 0603465A Future Vertical Lift Advanced Technology</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage targets at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments). Project K70 pursues technologies that provide our Warfighters with a Common Operating Picture (COP) to enable increased situational understanding and combat overmatch. Specific areas of maturation and demonstration include technologies that integrate disparate sensor architectures, perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), enable passive long range target identification (ID), improve day/night visualization systems, allow rapid wire area search, and facilitate augmented reality. Project K86 matures and validates airborne platform sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment, and deception. This Project provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots/crew members independently to enhanced operations in day/night/adverse weather conditions.

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates software and architectures for geospatial mapping applications and decision aids for the Warfighter. Project components, systems, system of systems, and decision aids enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, and counter-mobility to impede movement of threat forces. Additional components, systems, system of systems for survivability support protection of personnel, facilities, and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and for force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops and critical fixed and semi-fixed assets. Protection measures support force projection in areas such as air and sea ports of debarkation, dispersed small units, and units operating in complex and urban environments, which may include subterranean challenges. Work is in support of current and future ground force operations and future vertical lift. Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility of geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services, and coalition, and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information, and analytical tool suites. Methods to characterize and visualize behavior and population dynamics mature and validate efforts to portray the operational environment including culture, demographics, terrain, climate, and infrastructure, into geospatial frameworks. Force protection activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating in disbursed small units over complex and urban terrain and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems, and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and nonline-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; and passive protection to mitigate blast and weapon effects from advanced and emerging threats. Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and supports design and decision aids. Force protection activities are also focused on protection of critical assets and infrastructure required to project forces into denied access areas. Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces, including autonomous ground resupply and manned-unmanned teaming and demonstrates infrastructure health monitoring assessment technologies to support emerging projection challenges in complex, contested environments such as distributed sustainment over large distances. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) activities focus on developing capabilities for "upfront engineering" that will result in more operationally efficient and resilient systems that are more affordable in a more rapid fashion. This effort develops and demonstrates an end-to-end thread involving analysis to inform requirements, reduce risk, and assess lifecycle cost pre-milestone A through tradespace analytics for selected systems of interest. 

This work is being fully coordinated and is complementary to the ERS work described in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Element (PE) 0603832/Project D8Z.

This venue performs field based risk reduction (FBRR) and technology readiness assessments (TRAs) by evaluating the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of candidate Army science and technology (S&amp;T) and best of Industry efforts to support tactical network modernization. The yearly themes for the integrated capabilities event are determined by the maturity of the tech base programs across the Army S&amp;T command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I) portfolio. On an annual basis, those programs at or approaching TRL 6 will be solicited for participation based on their maturity to enter TRA in the FBRR environment located at Joint Base McGuire-Dix- Lakehurst (JB-MDL) (Fort Dix). Upon the completion of technology selection, themes will be developed that inform Army S&amp;T, CERDEC Thrust Areas, Army Warfighting Challenges, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) key technology imperatives, and the overall development of the Mission Command Network of 2025 and beyond.</r2:Description>

The HD R&amp;D program coordinates with the Department of State's Weapons Removal and Abatement Program, the Department of Defense DoD Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) programs of the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), and international mine action organizations and foreign militaries.   New technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at annual Requirements Workshop and UXO/IED Working Group Meetings.  Technology investments are prioritized using the results of these meetings and CCMD security cooperation and theater campaign plan HMA objectives.  The HD R&amp;D program advances the state-of-the-art of demining technologies and evaluates these technologies utilizing host nation humanitarian demining partners.

The HD R&amp;D program supports and bolsters the CCMD stability operations mission as directed under Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 3000.05 to foster mil-to-mil engagement, and bolster economic security and development with partner nations worldwide.  Additionally, the HD R&amp;D program fosters nations' mine action capacity while improving DoD's visibility and access, generating long-term positive perceptions of DoD and the US, and fostering collaborative relationships with host nation governments. It also directly supports the National Defense Strategy through ensuring common domains remain open and free.

The HD R&amp;D Program utilizes a research and development plan based on operational test data gained through Operational Field Evaluations (OFEs).  These OFEs provide the HD R&amp;D program a unique capability to collect this data against live mines/UXO in actual minefields around the world.  This data is unavailable to any other DoD organization. This OFE data drives future HD R&amp;D program investment decisions and is shared and leveraged by the U.S. Army's Army Futures Command programs to further improve U.S. forces' technologies. In addition, the HD R&amp;D program provides mine and UXO detector training to the CCMDs at the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) in support of Military to Military training and partnerships. Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 234 evaluations in 43 countries, including Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Colombia, Iraq, Kosovo, Ukraine, and Vietnam. The program's technologies have cleared 71.2 million square meters of the world's toughest minefields, and found or destroyed 213,220 mines and UXO.

The HD R&amp;D program supports the DoD's strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with (DODI) 3000.05 (Stability Operations) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3207.01C (Department of Defense Support to Humanitarian Mine Action) to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance.

This PE will be executed by the Army Futures Command (AFC).

Work in this PE was previously conducted under DoD PE 0603920D8Z, Humanitarian Demining.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

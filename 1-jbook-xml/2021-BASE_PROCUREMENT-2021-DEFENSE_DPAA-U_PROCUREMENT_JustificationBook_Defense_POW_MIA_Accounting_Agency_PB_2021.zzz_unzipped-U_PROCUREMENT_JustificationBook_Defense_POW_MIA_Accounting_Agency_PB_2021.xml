            <proc:Description>Purchase non-US manufactured, trucks, light trucks, and sport utility vehicles (SUV) for DPAA investigation and recovery activities in southeast Asia.  Vehicle prices vary depending on the type of vehicle replaced.  Likely range between $25,000 and $47,000.  Quantities of specific vehicles will vary from year to year depending on available programmed service life.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) provides families and the Nation with the fullest possible accounting for missing personnel from past conflicts.  As a Defense Agency, the DPAA leads the national effort to develop and implement DoD policy on all matters relating to personnel accounting from past conflicts, conduct global search, recovery, and laboratory operations to identify personnel from past conflicts, provide information and answers to the families of missing personnel, share their stories, and, when possible, bring home their remains.  This includes those who are unaccounted for from World War II, the Korean War, Cold War, Indochina (Vietnam) War, Persian Gulf War, the Iraq Theater of Operations, and other conflicts or incidents as the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) directs.  The DPAA also provides analytical support to official United States delegations and technical discussions with host nation officials.  Additionally, the DPAA is continuing to implement the transformation of DoDs personnel accounting for past conflicts as directed by the SECDEF, involving such things as enhanced strategic partnerships to more effectively account for missing personnel and to ensure their families receive accurate information.

DPAA maintains a number of vehicles at OCONUS detachments in southeast Asia (Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand) to transport investigation and recovery teams.  Due to the poor road conditions and inadequate repair facilities, the service-life of the vehicles is considerably shorter.</proc:Justification>

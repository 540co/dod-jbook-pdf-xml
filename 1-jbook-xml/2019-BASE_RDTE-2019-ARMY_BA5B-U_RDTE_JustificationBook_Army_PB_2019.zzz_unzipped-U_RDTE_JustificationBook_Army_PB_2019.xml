            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P) is the cornerstone of Joint Forces' Command and Control (C2), Situational Awareness (SA), and Communications. JBC-P provides secure Blue Force Tracking (BFT) capability at the Platform and Command Post levels, and continuous near-real-time identification of friendly locations, reported enemy, and hazardous locations populating the tactical Common Operating Picture (COP). JBC-P enables Joint, Net-Centric C2/Battle Command by seamlessly passing/sharing relevant information vertically and horizontally, within all tactical levels of command and control. JBC-P is designed to be used on L-Band Satellite Networks and terrestrial radios.

PdM JBC-P, under PM Mission Command (MC), is collaborating with the Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center's (CERDEC) Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD) on evolving BFT network. Systems engineering studies/planning activities are underway to develop the evolution path of the BFT network. In addition, there are two RDT&amp;E contractual efforts underway for FY 2018 and FY 2019 that will aid in assessing the feasibility of reusing existing BFT-2 transceivers (hardware) and replacing them with advanced, government owned hardware/software. The goal is to have a BFT-3, full and open solicitation to industry, ready for FY 2020.  

To better understand how potential changes to the BFT network would affect overall operations, S&amp;TCD is working on developing a model of the current BFT-2 waveform to test in the BFT portion of their Network Test Lab. This Test Lab provides the Government the ability to test proposed fixes, conduct regression testing of future Software and Firmware releases, and replicate any problems the system may experience without impacting the operational network.

FORSCOM users have identified a need for an expeditionary JBC-P capability to better connect the Lower Tactical Internet (LTI) to the BFT network when dismounted.  PdM JBC-P has partnered with CERDEC's Command, Power and Integration Directorate to develop the capability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JBC-P includes a network which enables the movement of data and provides secure Blue Force Tracking (BFT) capability in Platforms and Command Posts, providing soldiers and commanders a map-based Common Operating Picture of the battlefield, as a result, reducing fratricide.

PdM JBC-P, under PM Mission Command (MC), is collaborating with the Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center's (CERDEC) Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD) on evolving BFT network. Systems engineering studies/planning activities are underway to develop the evolution path of the BFT network.

The goal is to have a BFT-3, full and open solicitation to industry, ready for FY 2020.  

To better understand how potential changes to the BFT network would affect overall operations, funding was increased in both FY17 and FY18 to assist PdM JBC-P to fully model the operational BFT network; S&amp;TCD is working on developing a model of the current BFT-2 waveform to test in the BFT portion of their Network Test Lab. This Test Lab provides the Government the ability to test proposed fixes, conduct regression testing of future Software and Firmware releases, and replicate any problems the system may experience without impacting the operational network.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JBC-P Capabilities Development Document in lieu of Capabilities Production Document (CDD ILO CPD) was Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved March 2013. Completed Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) as part of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.2 in 3QFY2013. The IOT&amp;E tested the JBC-P system software on existing FBCB2 hardware (non-dismountable vehicle systems) and future production-representative hardware. On completion of Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Interoperability Test Certification (JITC), MDA authorized Full Rate Production (FRP) in 1QFY2014. First unit equipped (FUE) was successfully conducted 3QFY2015.

Developmental efforts are being performed through intra-government collaboration.  System engineering efforts are being performed by CERDEC's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD); Command, Power and Integration (CP&amp;I) &amp; the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD). Hardware along with fielding, training and field support efforts are obtained through existing competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds advanced development of medical materiel within the System Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production portions of the acquisition life cycle using 6.5 (System Development and Demonstration) funding. It supports products successfully developed in the Systems Integration portion of the Systems Development and Demonstration phases through completion of the Milestone C Decision Review. Commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for military use, when available. This PE primarily includes pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials necessary for licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

Projects in this PE include the following:

Project 812 funds military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. These funds provide for engineering and manufacturing development of candidate vaccines and drugs to permit large-scale field testing. Development focused on military unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. Products from this project will normally transition to Department of Defense (DoD) Health Programs or Other Procurement, Army (OPA) Funds.

Project 832 funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. Mature COTS medical products are also evaluated for military use. Consideration will also be given to reduce the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel. Products from this project will normally transition to OPA Funds. 

Project 849 funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for military relevant infectious diseases. These products fall in four major areas: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures to limit exposure and disease transmission. FDA approval is a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members for human use. Products from this project will normally transition to DoD Health Programs or OPA funds. 

Project VS8 program receives products that transition from VS7 and funds effort to complete research and development for the medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) Mission Essential Packages (MEPs) to support 256 Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters. The Army's force design increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  

These Projects are managed by United States (U.S.) Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. Specifically funds pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials or mechanical engineering evaluations for effectiveness of devices or biologics (products derived from living organisms) to fulfill unique military requirements. Consideration is also given to reducing the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel. This work is frequently completed through a laboratory/contractor team with the contractor obtaining the U.S. FDA licensure for sale of the product.

Major contractors/intra-governmental agencies include: IGR Enterprises,Inc.;Army Medical Department Board Test Center;Se Qual Technologies,Inc.; Enginivity, Inc.;Ultrasound Diagnostics,Inc.;HemCon Medical Technologies,; Cerdak Ltd;Hemerus Medical,LLC; Fast Track Drugs &amp; Biologics,LLC; Integrated Medical Systems,Inc;the National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and Institute of Surgical Research (ISR) for user evaluation. Other military agencies include Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, PEO Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS &amp; CSS), and Naval Undersea Warfare Center.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures (MCM: e.g. vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices) for militarily relevant infectious diseases. This also funds methods to determine if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms thereby posing a risk to service members' and control insect exposure/prevent Warfighters form being bitten by those insects. It funds research that supports conclusive human clinical trials to demonstrate MCM effectiveness  safety  and related manufacturing tests. This work, which is jointly performed by military laboratories, civilian contracted pharmaceutical firms and foreign research partners, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed. Medical products approved for human use must meet the U.S. FDA approval before MCM can be used on Warfighters. Development priority is based upon four major factors: (1) the extent of the disease within the Combatant Commands' theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development, production, and sustainment). Malaria, dysentery, hepatitis , and Dengue diseases (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), which are found in all Combatant Command areas and are at the top of the infectious diseases risks list.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Original models of Army Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters continue to play a major role in maintaining high U.S. troop survival rates in Iraq and Afghanistan by evacuating wounded troops in less than one-hour. In 2009, a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs. In 2010, the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation. In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP upgrades and retrofits the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and demonstration of networked munitions, countermine systems, and counter improvised explosive device capabilities.  This PE also implements the National Landmine Policy to develop alternatives to the non-self-destructing counter mobility anti-personnel landmine systems. The PE contributes to area access and area denial (A2/AD) to support unified land operations and improve soldier survivability. 

Project 016, Close Combat Capabilities provides for developing improvements to legacy dismounted lane breaching, specifically the Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS), and in so doing, provides a pathway to the next generation of dismounted lane breaching systems such as the Rapid Assault Lane Line Charge (RALLC) and the Dismounted Explosive Breaching System (DEBS).  The efforts will address capability gaps identified during combat operations and will focus on weight reduction, improved scalability, collateral damage reduction, metallic content elimination, deployment accuracy improvement, and increased effectiveness against the current threat.

In FY 2018 this project includes Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS). This effort will increase the Warfighter lethality and mobility, by optimizing Soldier protection for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel while effectively managing all life cycle aspects of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

Project 415, Mine Neutralization/Detection provides for development of next generation standoff, detection, and neutralization capability programs such as Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS), Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS), Vehicle Optics Sensor System (VOSS), Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD), formerly known as the Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS), Route Clearance Vehicles (RCV) and Enablers, Multi-Function Video Display (MVD) and Add on Armor (AoA) kits.   It also supports development of Explosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) capability to neutralize/detonate a broad spectrum of improvised explosive hazards while on the move to support area access route clearance missions.  Provides funding to the Tank Automotive Research Development Engineering Center (TARDEC)  Software Engineering Center (SEC) to integrate enhancements and test Explosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) software releases incorporating support for MVD.   

For RCIS Type I, FY 2019 funding supports the continued incremental funding of two symbiotic EMD contracts that will digitize and automate the High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE). EMD contract efforts include system design, integration, technical/test reviews, logistics development, testing and delivery of RCIS prototypes. 

Project 434, Spider Increment 1A will build upon the existing M7 Spider system.  The M7 Spider system is a hand-emplaced, remotely controlled (Man-In-The-Loop) system that provides highly responsive terrain-shaping and protection capabilities.  M7 Spider replaces persistent anti-personnel landmines, is compliant with US National Landmine policy, and has been fielded to US forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and currently being fielded to Engineers and Brigade Combat Teams in the Active and Army National Guard components.  Additional capabilities will be developed to enhance the Spider Remote Control Station and demonstrate the ability to employ legacy Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) lethal and non-lethal anti-personnel (AP) munitions and counter mobility obstacles.  Spider Increment 1A will utilize an open system architecture to facilitate future munition integration.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DLBS acquisition strategy is for developing product improvements such as making the system lighter and more module to the Antipersonnel and Obstacle Breaching System.  These improvements will then be incorporated into the technical data package for future procurements.

The Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS) Program is a single-step to full capability acquisition program utilizing full and open competition to ensure best value to the Army. Acquisition strategy for this program is a traditional development program that include an Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase ranging in duration from 12 to 48 months due to the level of design complexity and testing required. MS B / MDD is now scheduled for FY18 and MS C for FY22.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for the next generation of capabilities to detect, identify and neutralize hybrid threats and explosive hazards such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and landmines.  These capabilities are a Family of Systems (FOS) encompassing handheld, vehicle mounted, small robotic mounted, aerial platform mounted and area access, and neutralization systems operating in manned, remotely controlled, semi-autonomous or fully autonomous modes.  Continued development of this FOS is necessary to support Route Clearance Platoons located within both Engineer Companies and Brigade Engineering Battalion Brigade Combat Teams.

The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) is a counter-explosive device capability that provides standoff detection and marking of metallic encased caches and metallic and low-metallic antitank landmines, unexploded ordnance, trigger mechanisms, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of route and area-clearance operations. HMDS is a mission equipment package mounted on the Husky route clearance vehicle. The program was restructured in Sep 2016 to align with emerging shallow buried Wire Detection (WD) capabilities integrated onto the HMDS Increment A1 configuration (includes Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)).  These changes are necessary to adapt to changing IED threats. WD Technology will be fully integrated through Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) beginning in FY18.  Prototypes developed under the concluded HMDS Increment A2 effort may be leveraged in development of future capabilities.  Future capabilities may include detection of deep buried IEDs and caches, and semi-autonomous control of the Husky vehicle and HMDS from inside a follow-on vehicle.

Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) consists of two semi-autonomous vehicles, RCIS Type I and RCIS Type II, and includes designated control vehicles and Operator Control Units (OCUs) which provide a standoff capability to detect and neutralize the full spectrum of explosive hazards. RCIS Type I and Type II are being procured as separate increments. Type I integrates a semi-autonomous kit onto a High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE) for remote control from a Buffalo Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle (MPCV). RCIS Type I semi-autonomous kit will be integrated onto the HMEE and be capable of interrogating and classifying explosive hazards. Type II integrates a semi-autonomous kit on a route clearance lead Medium Mine Protected Vehicle (MMPV) for operation from another MMPV. The RCIS Type II semi-autonomous kit will be able to detect, neutralize and proof explosive hazards.  An OCU will be integrated into a Buffalo MPCV for Type I and an MMPV for Type II. RCIS capabilities will be fielded to Route Clearance Squads and Engineer Platoons.

For RCIS Type I, FY 2019 funding supports the continued incremental funding of two symbiotic EMD contracts that will digitize and automate HMEE.  EMD contract efforts include system design, integration, technical/test reviews, logistics development, testing and delivery of RCIS prototypes. 
 
The Vehicle Optics Sensor System (VOSS) provides a telescoping, gyro-stabilized, high-resolution, triple sensor (daylight, night-vision, and thermal-imaging) surveillance system to optically detect from standoff distances, explosive hazards (IEDs and landmines) and their trigger sources.  VOSS will be mounted on the MMPV Type I for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and MMPV Type II for Engineers.  VOSS will integrate and qualify a Geo-location capability, and develop and integrate a new, less costly, more reliable, sustainable and durable Infrared (IR) camera.  VOSS will not require any FY2019 base funding.

The Multifunction Video Display (MVD) provides view/control capability of the enablers (Interrogation Arms, VOSS, Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS), Drivers Vision Enhancement, Vehicle Situational Awareness Cameras) in the MMPV Type II to all Operators.  New capabilities will be added into that display to view and control future Unmanned Ground Vehicle Systems (UGVs) programs Route Clearance &amp; Integration System (RCIS) and Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS), Explosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) Roller and view Unmanned Aerial Vehicles video feeds.  Additional software will need to be developed to add these capabilities.  In addition, a new capability to push the video feeds of all of the enablers (Interrogation Arms, VOSS, Man Transportable Robotic System, Drivers Vision Enhancement and Vehicle Situational Awareness Cameras) from various vehicles within a Route Clearance Patrol will be developed.

 Route Clearance Vehicle (RCV) &amp; Enabler Improvements:  Develop the hardware used to improve POR RCVs and Enablers
 -   Develop product upgrades to MMPV Type II Interrogation Arm so it can be operated by the MVD.
 -   Next Generation HMDS A2 to include Deep Buried Detection on the Husky and semi-autonomous control capability on the Husky and MMPV Type II 
 -   Explosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) hardware upgrades
 -   Develop Interrogation Arm upgrades to the Buffalo MPCV
 -   Route Clearance Vehicle Acceleration Study
 -   Vehicle C4I Convergence
 -   Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) Vehicle Integration

Force Protection Improvements/Add On Armor (AoA) to execute system level design cycle for Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) and explosive formed projectiles (EFP) AoA kits for Husky and Buffalo. Kits will be developed so that RPG and EFP protection can be installed at the same time.  In order to do this lighter weight design solutions will be developed.  

Explosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) capability to include a debris blower, Wire Neutralization System (WNS) and Mine Roller to neutralize/detonate a broad spectrum of improvised explosive hazards while on the move, to support route clearance mission.

TARDEC Software Center (SEC) provides support for the Explosive hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) Roller, updating software throughout Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) activities.  The SEC will continue development of the EHP Roller software to integrate EHP Roller functionality with Multi-Visual Display (MVD).  In addition, the SEC will develop a Software Integration Lab (SIL) to support integration as well as maintenance and troubleshooting improvements.

Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD), formerly known as the Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS), provides increased survivability through mine and explosive hazards stand-off detection, marking and neutralization capability for the dismounted soldier.  It provides area access and freedom of movement for the Commander.  SREHD consists of payload modules to be mounted on man-portable unmanned ground vehicles.  The payloads are for surface laid and buried threats to include mines and explosive hazards.  SREHD transitioned from Technical Development to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2014.  This capability allows a soldier to remain in a protective posture while detecting and neutralizing a wide variety of hybrid and conventional explosive threats.

FY2019 Base funding of $38.945 million includes $27.681 million to support the continued development of the Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS); $9.350 million to support development and testing of RCIS Type I &amp; II; $0.500 million to support continued MVD development; $0.425 million to support RCV and Enabler improvements; and $0.989 million to support SREHD Developmental Testing (DT) corrective actions and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) planning.

Explosive Hazard Protection for Mounted Clearance (EHPMC) provides a solution to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and system survivability to defeat improvised explosive devices and explosive hazards.  Specific capability gaps include:  limited vehicle force protection and system survivability capabilities and capability to extract casualties from the vehicles; and lack of capability to protect Soldiers heads, necks, and backs from the effects of explosive hazards blasts while seated inside vehicles, suppress external vehicle fires, and disconnect towed vehicles in emergency situations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) program is pursuing an acquisition approach that delivers capability increments - Increment A, Configuration 1 (A1) to the Warfighter by leveraging the Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) currently deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).  In FY2019, the program will continue to execute an Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to add a wire detection capability to address evolving threat, and Infrared illumination to enable nighttime operation. A second ECP to improve operational availability of the HMDS during inclement weather and address obsolescence and Cyber Security deficiencies will begin in FY19.  

The Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) program executes an Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase for Type I systems with an OEM contract award for Delta High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE) support and a contract award to one EMD contractor for the Semi-Autonomous Control (SAC) Kit in FY 2018.  The SAC Kit award will be based on a source selection from full and open competition.  The SAC EMD contract awardee will execute Preliminary Design Review (PDR), design, integration, and build phase of seven Semi-Autonomous Capability (SAC) kits, integrated onto six vehicles, with one kit available for engineering and System Integration Lab (SIL) evaluations.  These assets will be used for the Government to execute a full Pre-Production Qualification Test (PPQT) and be evaluated against Capability Production Document (CPD) and performance specification requirements. Production and Technical Data Package (TDP) procurement options on the EMD contract take advantage of competition to assist in cost reduction. The RCIS Type I program Lifecycle Cost Estimate (LCCE), and associated budget request, was updated based on costs associated with modifying the base HMEE platform to accept the SAC kit, changes in the acquisition strategy and alignment of development and test activities in support of a production decision. To support EMD, ALUGS is funding Reset/Recap of up to six Buffalo Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle (MPCV) test assets at Letterkenny Army Depot.  These will be provided to the SAC contractor for Operator Control Unit (OCU) integration.  

The Vehicle Optics Sensor System (VOSS) program is pursuing an acquisition approach which harvests Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) procured systems for refresh and insertion into the Program of Record (POR).  In FY 2018 VOSS will transition a qualified Geo-location capability and full technical data package for Government fabrication / manufacture, and complete requirements, interfaces and technical data to enable integration of a less costly, more sustainable and durable IR Camera. There are no planned activities in FY 2019.

EHP Debris Blower was procured as a COTS item from a commercial vendor in FY 2016.  EHP Roller ad EHP Wire Neutralization System (WNS) will be procured starting in FY 2018.  MVD will be procured through a sole source contract FY 2017. Spiral development of software upgrades to MVD will be procured in FY 2018.  MMPV Type II Interrogation Arm Engineer Change Proposals/upgrades would be procured in the out years once the user identifies the upgrades needed.

The Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) (formerly known as AMDS) is currently in the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and is being developed to provide standoff detection, marking, and neutralization of explosive hazards (e.g., landmines, improvised explosive devices (IED), booby-traps (explosive), and unexploded ordnance (UXO)) in complex and urban terrain, including confined areas and subterranean environments (e.g., buildings, bunkers, tunnels, etc.).  The EMD phase consists of a preliminary design phase, which culminates with the Preliminary Design Review (PDR), a Risk Reduction Test (RRT) to evaluate the preliminary design, a critical design phase, which culminates with the Critical Design Review (CDR), integration with the Talon IV chassis and the Remote Activation Munition System (RAMS), a prototype build of 11 systems, which will be used for integration activities and to conduct the Government Development Test (DT), and a Logistics Demonstration (LogDemo).  Transition to Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) is scheduled to occur in the 3rd Quarter of FY 2018 under PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335, for the neutralization capability, as well under OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) for the detection and marking capabilities.  Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) will start in the 4th Quarter of FY 2019 and conclude in the 1st Quarter of FY 2020 with LRIP assets.  Award of the Full Rate Production (FRP) contract is scheduled to occur in the 2nd Quarter of FY 2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Spider Increment 1A will build upon the existing M7 Spider system.  The M7 Spider system is a hand-emplaced, remotely controlled (Man-In-The-Loop) system that provides highly responsive terrain-shaping and protection capabilities.  M7 Spider replaces persistent anti-personnel landmines, is compliant with US National Landmine policy, and has been fielded to US forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and currently being fielded to Engineers within Brigade Combat Teams in the Active and Army National Guard components.  Additional capabilities will be developed to enhance the Spider Remote Control Station and demonstrate the ability to employ legacy Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) lethal and non-lethal anti-personnel (AP) munitions and counter mobility obstacles. Spider Increment 1A will utilize an open system architecture to facilitate future munition integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 323, the Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program, acquires and sustains highly flexible, customized, cost effective, common, and simplified non-developmental Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) solutions that improve interoperability and connectivity on the battlefield while garnering efficient competition to integrate the latest commercial technology onto the Army tactical network. CHS provides technical support, environmental and evaluation testing, system design, and end of life/configuration management across Army tactical programs  to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the development of capabilities. CHS hardware evaluations facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across the operational battlefield. CHS creates efficiencies through the acquisition of streamlined common hardware configurations across the Common Operating Environments (COE)s, the sustainment community, and tactical programs. CHS also provides logistical services to include worldwide 72-hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements. 
 
Project 334, the Common Software (CS) program, is the suite of systems through which the Army develops, integrates and tests common software products and/or components used for communication between Army Mission Command Systems and Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Mission Command (MC) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort.  The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems.  The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's COE modernization efforts. There is no FY19 RDTE funding since Common SW will be transitioning into sustainment in FY19.
 
Project C29, the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF), is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of system verification/validation checkout, testing, and configuration management for the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. 
 
Project C34 funds the PEO Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Technical Management Division (TMD), which effectively manages the System-of-Systems engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts for the continuing evolution of the network within the PEO C3T portfolio of technology across the capability enhancement packages to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solutions.  

Project EJ5, the Mounted Computing Environment (MCE), is one of the six computing environments (CEs) formalized by the AAE under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative. MCE standardizes end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications. The JBC-P is the foundational hardware element of the MCE. MCE enables Mission Command capability development to echelons from dismounted command nodes to echelons above corps, providing enhanced interoperability, and simplified end-user interface. Requirements for the MCE are established in the draft Mounted Computing Environment Information System Initial Capabilities Document (MCE IS CDD).  FY2019 funding provides the means to continue to manage and develop MCE in concert with CPCE.
  
Project EJ4, the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), is one of the computing environments under the Common Operating Environment (COE).  It provides a common framework (Common Infrastructure / Common Services) upon which future Warfighter capabilities can be built. The CPCE targets Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA) capability development at tactical echelons that span from Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to company level. The CPCE will be the most critical computing environment developed to support the command posts and combat operations. 
 
Project EJ7, Tactical Digital Media (TDM), is comprised of photo, video and audio recording and editing equipment that will be assembled and issued as variant kits tailored to unit mission requirements. TDM kits address modernization gaps associated with all operational Combat Camera (COMCAM), Public Affairs (PA), and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) units. TDM provides essential imagery, multimedia products, and live interview capabilities that directly contribute to successful execution of a Commander's strategic engagement and communications strategy across the full range of military operations.  No FY19 RDTE funding.
 
Project EK9, Tactical Network Operations (NetOps) Management (TNOM), will support the development and integration of the Tactical NetOps software capabilities in support of Network Operations (NetOps) Convergence, Army Objectives and emerging Cyber Center of Excellence (CCOE) requirements. The end state program is designed to synchronize LandWarNet, Network-enabled Mission Command, and Global Information Grid 2.0 Network Operations (NetOps) efforts in an integrated and interoperable framework, spanning all echelons of command and supporting the full range of military operations for Army, Joint, and Coalition Forces in order to ensure converged NetOps. The initial mission is convergence of DoD Information Network (DoDIN) functions into a single integrated set of Tactical NetOps and Management software. This integrated solution provides NetOps capability to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Theater network entry point and supports the implementation of integrated NetOps for Unified Network Operations (UNO). UNO will deliver a standardized visualization capability (integrating both Upper and Lower Tactical Internet NetOps) in order to reduce complexity and inform the military decision making processes. UNO will also provide enhanced capability to detect, respond, and restore from cyber incidents.

Project ER9, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2), fields mobile Command Post Nodes by integrating supporting mission command solutions in accordance with Directed Requirement with a FY20 First Unit Equipped in order to enhance the survivability and mobility of brigade and below command post formations. On order, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure will replace selected elements of the legacy command post to provide improved expeditionary capability, survivability, agility, and scalability for Corps and Division Main and Tactical Command Posts, Brigade Main and Tactical Command Posts, and Battalion Command Posts. It will ensure information and support systems are introduced into the Command Post through physical integration allowing the commander to tailor the Command Post as missions dictate.

Project EQ8, Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment, supports the Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program.  The program leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations.  The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader.  

Project EW3, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR), is the process performed by the S6 and their staff to affect change on the network in order to support the operational mission and dynamic nature of the Army.  Currently network challenges exist during this process with regard to:  maintaining accurate and up to date information,  distributing configuration files and activating / re-establishing the network.  UTR strives to make authoritative NETOPS available across all systems, reduce cognitive burden for soldiers to plan and manage the network and reduce manual touch labor.   

Project EJ6, Tactical Enhancement, supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Modular Communications Node - Advanced Equipment (MCN-AE), Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Site and beyond line of sight radio systems. SIGMOD Capabilities include: 
MCN-AE: Provides Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) communications to Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Signal Battalions over the WIN-T network; TRILOS: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS). 
TRILOS: Enables Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) radio verses the aging HCLOS system.
TROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System. TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program acquires and sustains highly flexible, customized, cost effective, common, and simplified non-developmental C5ISR solutions that improve interoperability and connectivity on the battlefield while garnering efficient competition to integrate the latest commercial technology onto the Army tactical network. CHS provides technical support, environmental and evaluation testing, system design, and end of life/configuration management across Army tactical programs to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the development of capabilities. CHS hardware evaluations facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across the operational battlefield.  CHS creates efficiencies through the acquisition of streamlined common hardware configurations across the Common Operating Environments (COE)s, the sustainment community, and tactical programs. CHS also provides logistical services to include worldwide 72-hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements.

FY 2019 funds support CHS to continue to manage the acquisition and delivery of CHS equipment and associated services in support of customer requirements. It will also provide technology insertions and the continued support for hardware and systems engineering, and evaluations. CHS will continue CHS-5 contract post-award activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The overall goal is to improve interoperability, compatibility and sustainability and lower life cycle costs by standardizing battlefield command and control automation and other warfighting systems (net centric, etc) through centralized buys of modified/ruggedized non-developmental items. CHS will provide seamless, rapid, and consolidated procurement of commercial IT, customizable sustainment strategies, non-personal services, and continuous technology upgrades to support tactical programs fielding schedules. CHS provides a coherent migration strategy for acquisition of warfighting systems and new technology through the use of technology insertion. CHS also conducts common environmental testing of hardware items thereby reducing the testing requirements for individual Project Managers. CHS provides contractual tools that enable supported programs to effectively and efficiently establish organic sustainment support for commercial IT and utilizes hardware failure data and logistical analysis to support programs sustainment strategy decisions.

An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity firm fixed priced, full and open competition contract was awarded to General Dynamics in May 2003, for ruggedization and production. In August 2011, CHS awarded, on a best value basis, the follow-on CHS-4 contract via full and open competition.  CHS-5 is to be awarded in FY18 to provide flexibility for Tactical Programs of Record (PoR)s to meet hardware and associated services requirements through full and open competition and to provide an agile solution to support COE, network integration activities, capability set development, and logistical requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 334 Common Software (CS): CS is the suite of systems through which the Army develops, integrates and tests common software products and/or components used for communication between Army Mission Command Systems and the greater Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) community. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous C4ISR and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort. The CS program is the hub of interoperability for the Army's current C4ISR systems.

FY18 funding supports any remaining adjustments to ensure backwards compatibility with previous versions of Common Software products implementations.

There is no FY19 funding since CS will be transitioning into sustainment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The overall acquisition goal of the CS project is to provide common products that are used horizontally across programs, preventing duplication of effort by Army and Joint programs and facilitating life cycle cost efficiencies. All software development efforts will be competed among Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) certified developers.

In accordance with the approved Net-enabled Mission Command Initial Capabilities Document (NeMC ICD), software capability will be developed in 3-year increments to facilitate messaging, mediation and addressing for Army, Joint and Coalition Partners. The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the C4ISR systems, and a core communication component of the virtualized infrastructure and will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command (PM MC) General Services Administration (GSA) engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on a single development solicitation. This strategy is designed to optimize opportunities for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition, and to ensure the rapid integration of new capabilities into warfighter systems. This strategy is also designed to reduce the physical footprint, the logistics support requirements, and to increase operational efficiency by integration of additional system interoperability services which reduce duplication of effort and cost; and allows for development of communication standards across the DoD community.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project C29 - Centralized Technical Support Facility:  The Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF) is the Army's premier test and certification facility for System of Systems interoperability, functioning as CIO/G6's designated independent test agent.  CTSF is the Army's sole strategic facility responsible for conducting engineering support associated with test integration of Army LandWarNet/Mission Command (LWN/MC) architectures and baselines into the Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of systems environment, performing AIC testing and conducting configuration management for all operational and tactical level applications (individual systems, System of Systems, and Families of Systems) prior to fielding.  The CTSF provides validated test data to the Department of the Army and Joint agencies to accredit interoperability certifications.  The distributed test environment of the CTSF is accomplished through the Federation of Net-centric Sites (FaNS) construct.  This FaNS construct addresses distributed integration development and testing using the core infrastructure of the CTSF to harness AMC, Army, and Joint expertise/resources.  Through these federated resources, the CTSF executes interoperability development and certification testing of the Warfighter mission areas, to include Network Evaluation spinouts, as they digitize and become part of the Army's LandWarNet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The goal of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), one of the six computing environments under the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative, is to eliminate "stove-piped" legacy systems and provide an integrated, interoperable, cyber-secure, cost-effective computing infrastructure framework to serve as the basis for multiple warfighting functions. CPCE will provide Programs of Record a core infrastructure, including a common operating picture (COP) tool, common data strategy, common applications, common hardware configurations, and common look and feel (user interface) that allows rapid development of future capabilities within that construct.  This effort eliminates duplicative or redundant implementations, simplifies future development efforts, and enhances interoperability and data sharing across multiple echelons.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CPCE is not a Program of Record (PoR).

CPCE is being developed over time, with the initial set of v3 Minimum Essential Capabilities (MECs) being delivered in 4QFY19.  Subsequent deliveries of capabilities are expected on a 5 year cycle (FY22, FY25, FY28), in accordance with the draft COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD).  This cycle may be adjusted depending on many factors, including fielding priorities, effectiveness of backwards compatibility, and time required to develop and test new capabilities. The CPCE is a capability integration effort, based on a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf / Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) software infrastructure package that allows for immediate third party development of warfighting capability applications in support of integrated Command Post, Mounted and Dismounted tactical computing capabilities.  

Efforts are being accomplished through a Commercial-of-the-Shelf/based product that will provide the infrastructure foundation, along with a mixture of organic Government and industry partners whose services will enhance the capabilities to meet DoD requirements and security standards.  Government partners to include the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Weapons Software Engineering Center (WSEC), Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Software Engineering Center (SEC), Aviation and Missiles Research and Development Center (AMRDEC) Software Engineering Directorate (SED) and Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  Commercial suppliers are assigned efforts through GSA Mission Command Engineering Services vehicles and Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contracts. Hardware, core software and associated licenses to support converged system architecture is Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and procured through existing vehicles from GSA, Common Hardware Systems (CHS) and the Army Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Release 2 (ER2) and ER3, and formal lab-based Integration Events to evaluate the performance and interoperability of each ER with other Mission Command systems.  FY17 efforts also include DT and the Interoperability Integration Event (I2E). Planning and conduct of a Limited Objective Experiment (LOE) at the Mission Command Battle Lab is also in progress to gain user feedback from the initial system prototype. Cyber vulnerability testing is ongoing at the National Cyber Range (NCR). FY17 will conclude with planning for Operational Test and planning for Joint Warfighting Activity (JWA). MCE has also begun the development of a Test Instrumentation application that will reside on the developed end-state system to record data during test events, saving future formal Test Instrumentation costs.  Additionally, development of the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) is a major FY17 effort.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MCE is not a Program of Record (PoR).

MCE is being developed over time, with the initial set of v3 Minimum Essential Capabilities (MECs) being delivered in 4QFY19. Subsequent deliveries of capabilities are expected on a 5 year cycle (FY22, FY25, FY28), in accordance with the draft COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD). This cycle may be adjusted depending on many factors, including fielding priorities, effectiveness of backwards compatibility, and time required to develop and test new capabilities.

To accomplish the goals of the MCE, PEO C3T PM MC architects, designs, and develops the hardware, software, network solutions and capabilities required to achieve compliance with the COE. Primary systems architecture engineering is conducted by in-house Government engineering staff with support from CACI/Agile matrix elements and MITRE Corp, a Fully Funded Research and Development Centers. Test and Evaluation support is provided by in-house PM MC TMD staff, with support from contractor firms, for preparation and conduct of specific risk reduction events and test events. Developmental testing is being conducted by the software development teams with Government oversight and coordination. Hardware to support system architecture and software development is comprised of standardized equipment and is procured using existing contract vehicles such as Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Enhancement supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter  Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Site and beyond line of sight radio systems. In addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current WIN-T SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti-jam capability and resiliency to WIN-T Program of Record satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on currently fielded WIN-T satellite modems as well as those planned to be fielded for tech refresh in the near term.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY28/29).  The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events.  FY19 funding begins the Army's concentrated effort for near term satellite anti-jam protection.


SIGMOD Capabilities: 
TRILOS: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS).  TRILOS will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) radio verses the aging HCLOS system. 
TROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System.  TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth.
No FY18 funding:   Testing requirements for TROPO moved from FY18 to FY19  due to a delay in requirements definition and availability of COTS products to meet the requirement.

FY19 funds support TROPO test requirement and NCW-R future development and developmental testing effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>These funds will be used to conduct System Evaluation and Formal Testing of the various Signal Mod capabilities, specifically the TROPO and Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) systems.  This is in order to facilitate integration into the WIN-T tactical ground networks.  Testing and evaluation efforts will leverage the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events, specifically NIE 17.2 (TRILOS) events. TROPO test is anticipated in 3QFY19.   These test events will meet all mandatory testing requirements with full ATEC oversight. This Acquisition Strategy will integrate proven Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) capabilities into existing WIN-T nodes to expand and enhance network capacity and user access. The TROPO and TRILOS capabilities will be acquired as ACAT III programs to replace legacy equipment in the field while utilizing DoDI 5000.02 standard acquisition approaches, starting with Milestone C Determination for TRILOS (3QFY17) and TROPO (2QFY18). The Army will continue NCW-R development in FY19 and conduct developmental testing in 4th quarter FY19, followed by certification for operational use over Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites by Army Space and Missile Defense Command.  The Army projects to begin fielding this improved, resilient satellite communication waveform in 4th Quarter FY20.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Digital Media (TDM) is comprised of photo, video and audio recording and editing equipment that will be assembled and issued as variant kits tailored to unit mission requirements. TDM kits address modernization gaps associated with all operational Combat Camera (COMCAM), Public Affairs (PA), and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) units. TDM provides essential imagery, multimedia products, and live interview capabilities that directly contribute to successful execution of a Commander's strategic engagement and communications strategy across the full range of military operations. TDM also provides specific imagery, video, and multimedia support to commanders through the National Command Authority (NCA) level to assist with operational planning, decision-making, combat adversary misinformation/disinformation, alter perceptions regarding coalition efforts, and provide accurate and timely information to national and international audiences. Proposed TDM equipment is entirely commercial off the shelf (COTS) which is currently in use by military organizations and commercial industry.

FY17 Base funding in the amount of $2.467 million will be used to procure and evaluate representative candidate commercial off the shelf (COTS) camera and video equipment for effectiveness, suitability, and reliability.  FY17 efforts will include planning for full rate production decision, type classification, and award of a production delivery order to support future procurements.

No FY18 RDTE funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with the approved TDM Capabilities Production Document (CPD), the Army will be purchasing state-of-the-art COTS equipment to field media variant kits tailored to unit mission requirements. The equipment will be purchased on the Common Hardware Systems (CHS) contract, and will include warranties.

The program strategy for reaching full capability is to identify, and field a modern standardized set of digital media capabilities that enables the Army user community to acquire, and process digital media/visual information products able to be disseminated within a fully integrated Army tactical network operations environment, which includes commercial networks, and interfaces. The TDM program will replace legacy analog devices by providing state-of-the art COTS equipment supporting acquire and process operations that is centrally managed and resourced. New technologies and improvements of COTS equipment will be inserted as part of unit reset, New Equipment Fielding's or upgrades as necessary to provide users with state-of-art capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Network Operations (NetOps) Management (TNOM) will support the development and integration of the Tactical NetOps software capabilities in support of NetOps Convergence, Army Objectives and emerging Cyber Center of Excellence (CCOE) requirements. The end state program is designed to synchronize LandWarNet, Network-enabled Mission Command, and Global Information Grid 2.0 Network Operations (NetOps) efforts in an integrated and interoperable framework, spanning all echelons of command and supporting the full range of military operations for Army, Joint, and Coalition Forces in order to ensure converged NetOps. The initial mission is convergence of DoD Information Network (DoDIN) functions into a single integrated set of Tactical NetOps and Management software. This integrated solution provides NetOps capability to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Enterprise network entry point and supports the implementation of integrated NetOps for Unified Network Operations (UNO). UNO will deliver a standardized visualization capability (integrating both Upper and Lower Tactical Internet NetOps) in order to reduce complexity and inform the military decision making processes. UNO will also provide enhanced capability to detect, respond, and restore from cyber incidents.

FY19 funding will continue supporting the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to include supporting efforts for the development of Network Operations software, enhancing Network Visualization and Monitoring of the tactical network, standardizing data definition and storage to support Common Operational Picture, and simplify planning and configuration process for multiple network devices and radios. FY19 funding will continue supporting NetOps capability enhancements via an adapt and buy strategy. The UNO Program Office Management will utilize FY19 funding in support of requisite milestone documentation preparation prior to a projected 4QFY20 milestone decision.  FY19 funding will continue supporting the NetOps capability enhancements via an adapt and buy strategy. The NetOps capability enhancements that will be developed through the adapt and buy strategy supporting Unit Task Reorganization (UTR) prototypes, Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) prototypes, Commercial Net Management System (NMS) prototypes, and Initiating Planner Consolidation prototypes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Tactical Network Operations (NetOps) Management (TNOM) is built to deliver the capabilities described in the LandWarNet, Network-enabled Mission Command, and Global Information Grid 2.0 Initial Capabilities Documents (ICD) as refined by the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The AoA is replacing the ITNO Capability Production Document (CPD) strategy to align with Army priorities. An AROC decision followed by MDD is anticipated in 3rd Quarter 2018 to initiate the AoA. FY19 will complete AoA development to include supporting efforts for the development of Network Operations software, enhancing Network Visualization and Monitoring of the tactical network, standardizing data definition and storage to support Common Operational Picture, and simplify planning and configuration process for multiple network devices and radios. FY19 will also include Program Office Management support and subsequent efforts for capability development documentation.

The AoA will scope an integrated solution which provides NetOps capabilities to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Theater network entry point and supports the implementation of integrated NetOps for Unified Network Operations (UNO). After AoA completion, anticipate an UNO Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) to support a Milestone B decision anticipated for 4th Quarter FY20 with a contract award immediately following approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. The program plans to develop and deliver software, and conduct developmental and operational tests. A Limited Fielding Decision will follow testing.

In FY18-FY20, TNOM will continue supporting the NetOps capability enhancements via an adapt and buy OTA prototyping strategy. The NetOps capability enhancements that will be developed through the adapt and buy strategy supporting Unit Task Reorganization (UTR) prototypes, Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) prototypes, Commercial Net Management System (NMS) prototypes, and Initiating Planner Consolidation prototypes.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to the tactical vehicle-mounted leaders so that when dismounted, the leader still maintains the common operating picture (COP) and has continuous situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and enhanced communications to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight.  Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.

The continued development and integration of the NW program also integrates applications from other programs aimed at considerably reducing the weight and bulk of the dismounted Soldier's load by using a single End User Device. The NW program harnesses Soldiers' experience in combat operations and employs combat veterans for Soldier feedback enhancing human factors design and fightability of the system. This project funds the following: 1) Incorporation of additional new hardware applications and capabilities into Nett Warrior, 2) Yearly developmental and operational tests of the NW with continually advancing commercial smart device technology inserted, 3) Software development for planned updates, 4) Integration of new End User Devices with the existing and re-competed Army Tactical Radios, including vehicle power integration, 5) Government led integration and system engineering and program management, and 6) Integration with emerging transport systems.

Note:  FY16 and prior funding for Nett Warrior resided in 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem/Val) Project S75 (Ground Soldier Ensemble).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Nett Warrior (NW) program provides unparalleled situational awareness and mission command to dismounted combat leaders through a secure commercial smart device, power source, cables and tactical radio.  The NW is focused on Team Leader and higher echelons and provides an integrated secure information-centric Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) mobile application-based computation platform with data collection, enhanced SA, mission planning, and navigational aid functions overlaid on geo-referenced maps and high resolution imagery throughout a brigade.  The NW enables real-time ground tactical-level knowledge sharing and command and control (C2), directly impacting combat effectiveness and decision-making.  The NW also improves lower echelon intelligence production and analysis capabilities which are central to efficient and effective counter-insurgency warfare.  NW program completed LRIP/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&amp;E under DOT&amp;E oversight in 4QFY14-1QFY15.  This IOT&amp;E event led to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision is planned for early FY18.  From this decision NW will complete annual production and fielding events based on yearly development, integration and testing of emerging advanced smart devices to lower cost, weigh and power.  To capitalize on commercial industry's investment in advanced smart device technology as well as innovation and changes within Army, NW requires annual RDT&amp;E funding for integration and evaluation.  Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Command Post is line of effort 4 of the Army Modernization strategy.  Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications - Tactical (PEO C3T) will develop mobile Command Post solutions by integrating supporting mission command and communications systems in accordance with a Directed Requirement (14 Dec 2017) and Capability Development Document.  CPI2 replaces legacy command post systems at Corps, Division, and Brigade Combat Team and below command post formations with more capable, survivable, agile, and scalable command post solutions.   It will ensure information and support systems are introduced into the Command Post through physical integration allowing the commander to tailor the Command Post as missions dictate. CPI2 was established to meet the emerging threat environment to improve the survivability and mobility of current Command Posts.  The Directed Requirement First Unit Equipped is in FY20.

FY19 funding provides for acquiring  platforms for System Design, Prototyping and integration solutions for select Mission Command Platforms (MCP) and Command Post Support Vehicles (CPSV).    The CPSV is a formation appropriate vehicle that hosts mission command servers, radios, local area network systems and unified voice management capability and secure wireless in support of the Integrated Command Post at the Halt.  The MCP is a formation appropriate vehicle that provides a digitally connected workspace to support commanders and staff at the Corps/Division Command Group, Main and Tactical Command Posts and at the Brigade and Battalion Command Posts and Command Groups.  FY19 funding will also support the procurement of two brigade sets of coalition gateways to prototype and assess existing solutions to provide the Army a seamless information network exchanges and integration of Joint and legacy radios as an interim solution toward the future transport layer.  It will provide commanders a rugged and portable air-to-ground command and control capability that enables Link 16, a simultaneous line-of-sight and/or satellite communication.  The Army seeks an integrated message translation capability to form incompatible messages from disparate networks into a clear common operating picture, improving the prevention of fratricide and collateral damage while also raising ISR visibility.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FY18-FY21 Directed Requirement for CPI2 will leverage existing contracts managed by Project Manager (PM) Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Project Manager (PM) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) for integration efforts associated with JLTV and Stryker. CPI2 will use a Functional Support Agreement for the prototype development of the M1079 Command Post Support Vehicle (CPSV) and an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contract for the prototype development of the M1087 Mission Command Platform (MCP).  One Early User Test (EUT) will be executed with the intended First Unit Equipped (FUE) unit to allow feedback into the initial Command Post (CP) design. A Request For Proposal (RFP) will be released for a production contract for the M1079 CPSV in 1QFY20 with a projected award in 3QFY20 to produce four brigade sets.  The OTA contract will be used to produce four brigade sets of M1087 MCPs.

The CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD) is projected for Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approval in FY18 with a Milestone B projected for 1QFY20. Competitive contract award planned for 1QFY21 based on Request For Proposal (RFP) responses and source selection process. This contract will be a 5-year Firm Fixed Priced/Cost Plus Fixed Fee (FFP/CPFF) contract for the design, engineering, prototyping, Developmental Test (DT), new equipment training, one Limited User Test (LUT), and one Operational Test (OT) which will encompass CPI2 variants at Division HQ and BCT echelons with Option Years for production. CPI2 will leverage existing contracts managed by PM JLTV and PM SBCT for integration efforts associated with JLTV and Stryker.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The UTR effort supports the Army's modernization strategy number 4:  an "Army Network with hardware, software and infrastructure - sufficiently mobile and expeditionary - that can fight in any environment where the electromagnetic spectrum is denied or degraded."    The program sub-divides UTR into Network Sustainment, Network Planning, and Network Re-Establishment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This system is a component of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and will provide for an incrementally fielded Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System/capability for the composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades.  The Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) element and is a key component to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture via the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.

The Sentinel currently consists of two primary variants: the enhanced radar variant AN/MPQ-64A3 system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and the AN/MPQ-64A3 mounted on a 2.5 ton trailer and towed by an armored Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV) platform to meet force protection and IBCS system requirements. The fielding of the FMTV configuration AN/MPQ-64A3 assets will be complete in FY19. Sentinel also consists of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command, Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces. The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 kilometers.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.

The Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization/upgrades, hardware/software issue resolution, resolution of obsolescence issues, engineering studies, and cost reduction initiatives.  The funding for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 through FY 2023 development activities addresses the following Sentinel system capability gaps and obsolescence issues identified by the User:  1) Target Detection gap; 2) Target Tracking gap; 3) Net Readiness gap; 4) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) gap; 5) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Defense gap; and 6) Rockets, Artillery &amp; Mortars (RAM) gap. 

Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect (EA/EP) addresses the electronic countermeasures (ECM) gap.  This effort conducts additional design and testing to verify initial EA/EP results and updates the database and associated software and hardware with more extensive EA/EP signatures to address evolving threats. Addresses further EP modifications and methods to be determined based on analysis of results.

Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) addresses the Target Detection, Target Tracking, and Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability gaps and funds the mitigation of the SDP and NFM obsolescence issues.   SDP cards are estimated to go obsolete every four to six years. Provides for new SDP kit to address obsolescence issues and allow for additional Electronic Protect capability.

Medium Bandwidth Waveform upgrade will address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  This development effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  This effort will provide better target resolution and more accurate tracking in the slant range coordinate.  This improved target resolution and tracking accuracy will provide improved retention of target identification and more robust tracking that addresses the latent tracking issues.  

Mode S upgrade to existing Sentinel Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) will address Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate IFF mode S which is currently not being met.  Mode S transmissions are a key component of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) surveillance technology being used by the Federal Aviation Administration for tracking aircraft as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  In the United States, all aircraft required to have transponders (most aircraft) must transition to Mode S capable units by 2020.  Without the Mode S upgrade, Sentinel will have to rely on these aircraft transponders responding to the legacy mode 3/A interrogations.  The data available in the Mode S response will be valuable in identifying the aircraft and correlating Sentinel tracks with civil aviation tracks/data and other track data sources. Develops the Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) software to address the delayed Mode M Global Positioning System (GPS) capability requirement with the new interrogator.

The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) (Sentinel A4) is the next generation of radar technology to replace the current phase and frequency scanned array used by Sentinel today.  The AESA Antenna will provide increased capability including extended range for ground-based surveillance and situational awareness, faster and more accurate Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) for clearing fires and preventing fratricide, improved Fire Control (FC) quality track accuracy, and management of larger track loads.  The AESA will also provide improved operation in severe/urban clutter.  The system will detect and track small targets, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles, in clutter and will detect and track slow targets, such as UAS and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft, at low altitudes in clutter.  The system will detect, track, and classify Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats and will support Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) requirements and can contribute sensor support for mitigating current and future Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 mission requirements.

Sentinel System of Systems: Software Development in support of a system of systems architecture (IAMD and IFPC Inc 2-I) for a required simulation capability. The simulation capability will add a high fidelity representation of Sentinel to IAMD to allow for optimum engagement management and mission planning.  Supports Sentinel Digital Simulation Software (SDS/SENTSIM) development efforts for testing of future capabilities.  Includes software development for Low Slow Small in a test fix test environment as well as integration and testing of the IAMD B kit on board the Sentinel FMTV platform.

Adjunct sensor technology effort will integrate and test a supplemental technology for the Sentinel A3 radar to detect and identify current and emerging threats.  Adjunct sensor technology compliments current radar capabilities to improve system performance and reduces adversaries countermeasure abilities by improving system electronic protect capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This system is a component of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and will provide for an incrementally fielded Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System/capability for the composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades.  The Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) element and is a key component to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture via the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.

The Sentinel currently consists of two primary variants: the enhanced radar variant AN/MPQ-64A3 system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and the AN/MPQ-64A3 mounted on a 2.5 ton trailer and towed by an armored Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV) platform to meet force protection and Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) system requirements. The fielding of the FMTV configuration AN/MPQ-64A3 assets will be complete in FY 2019. Sentinel also consists of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command, Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces. The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 kilometers.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.

The Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization/upgrades, hardware/software issue resolution, resolution of obsolescence issues, engineering studies, and cost reduction initiatives.  The funding for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 through FY 2023 development activities addresses the following Sentinel system capability gaps and obsolescence issues identified by the User:  1) Target Detection gap; 2) Target Tracking gap; 3) Net Readiness gap; 4) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) gap; 5) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Defense gap; and 5) Rockets, Artillery &amp; Mortars (RAM) gap. 

Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect (EA/EP) addresses the electronic countermeasures (ECM) gap.  This effort conducts additional design and testing to verify initial EA/EP results and updates the database and associated software and hardware with more extensive EA/EP signatures to address evolving threats. Addresses further EP modifications and methods to be determined based on analysis of results.

Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) addresses the Target Detection, Target Tracking, and Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability gaps and funds the mitigation of the SDP and NFM obsolescence issues.   SDP cards are estimated to go obsolete every four to six years. Provides for new SDP kit to address obsolescence issues and allow for additional Electronic Protect capability.

Medium Bandwidth Waveform upgrade will address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  This development effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  This effort will provide better target resolution and more accurate tracking in the slant range coordinate.  This improved target resolution and tracking accuracy will provide improved retention of target identification and more robust tracking that addresses the latent tracking issues.  

Mode S upgrade to existing Sentinel Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) will address Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate IFF mode S which is currently not being met.  Mode S transmissions are a key component of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) surveillance technology being used by the Federal Aviation Administration for tracking aircraft as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  In the United States, all aircraft required to have transponders (most aircraft) must transition to Mode S capable units by 2020.  Without the Mode S upgrade, Sentinel will have to rely on these aircraft transponders responding to the legacy mode 3/A interrogations.  The data available in the Mode S response will be valuable in identifying the aircraft and correlating Sentinel tracks with civil aviation tracks/data and other track data sources. Develops the Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) software to address the delayed Mode M Global Positioning System (GPS) capability requirement with the new interrogator.

The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) (Sentinel A4) is the next generation of radar technology to replace the current phase and frequency scanned array used by Sentinel today.  The AESA Antenna will provide increased capability including extended range for ground-based surveillance and situational awareness, faster and more accurate Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) for clearing fires and preventing fratricide, improved Fire Control (FC) quality track accuracy, and management of larger track loads.  The AESA will also provide improved operation in severe/urban clutter.  The system will detect and track small targets, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles, in clutter and will detect and track slow targets, such as UAS and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft, at low altitudes in clutter.  The system will detect, track, and classify Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats and will support Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) requirements and can contribute sensor support for mitigating current and future Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 mission requirements.

Sentinel System of Systems: Software Development in support of a system of systems architecture (IAMD and IFPC Inc 2-I) for a required simulation capability. The simulation capability will add a high fidelity representation of Sentinel to IAMD to allow for optimum engagement management and mission planning.  Supports Sentinel Digital Simulation Software (SDS/SENTSIM) development efforts for testing of future capabilities.  Includes software development for Low Slow Small in a test fix test environment as well as integration and testing of the IAMD B kit on board the Sentinel FMTV platform.

Adjunct sensor technology effort will integrate and test a supplemental technology for the Sentinel A3 radar to detect and identify current and emerging threats.  Adjunct sensor technology compliments current radar capabilities to improve system performance and reduces adversaries countermeasure abilities by improving system electronic protect capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Sentinel was procured from Raytheon as a non-developmental item.  Raytheon owns the Technical Data Package (TDP) for the Sentinel A3 and its predecessors and therefore no other contractor has the technical ability to modify the Sentinel radar or Sentinel software.  The modifications planned for the Sentinel that fall into this category are:  Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect, Signal Data Processor/North Finding Module, Medium Bandwidth, and Mode S.  For the Active Electronically Scanned Array, the product office will issue a new contract to develop a modified Sentinel with a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna.
 
Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect (EA/EP) (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to verify the initial EA/EP Database and update the database, software and hardware with more extensive EA/EP signatures to address evolving threats.  The updated database will be tested, documented and released for installation.   

Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) Obsolescence (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to upgrade and mitigate the Signal Data Processor and North Finding Module issues.  The updated SDP and NFM hardware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Medium Bandwidth Waveform (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  The effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  The updated medium bandwidth waveform software and firmware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Mode S (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to address Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) mode S on board commercial aircraft.  The updated software will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) (Sentinel A4): The Sentinel Product Office will award a new contract to develop the new AESA antenna for integration with the existing Sentinel A3 hardware and software.  The CMDS Product Office will support requirement documentation and conduct design analysis to include analysis of technology, decision review preparation, and contract package development for acquisition of the AESA antenna to upgrade the current Sentinel A3. The software and hardware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Sentinel System of Systems (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon for risk reduction efforts in the development of the software package to support the identification and engagement of Low Slow Small target sets.  The Sentinel Product Office will work with Other Government Agencies to finalize integration and test of the IAMD B Kit on board the Sentinel platform and to add simulation capability to allow a high fidelity representation of Sentinel to IAMD.

Adjunct Sensor (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will integrate and test a government off the shelf adjunct sensor.  The sensor will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Effective February 2, 2017 DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) for Defense Business Systems, applying to the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS).  This DoDI supersedes DoDI 5000.02, improving the alignment of business systems to commercial best practices as well as optimizing efficiencies and effectiveness across DoD for the acquisition of business systems.  Decisions rendered by the Milestone Decision Authority, as outlined in DoDI 5000.75, are referred to as "Authority To Proceed (ATPs)" and replace DoDI 5000.02 "Milestones."</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DV6 - General Fund Enterprise Business System-Sensitive Activities (GFEBS-SA): GFEBS-SA is a designated National Security System (NSS) and is leveraging the GFEBS base system that is a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning System certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council. The GFEBS base system has reached Full Deployment and is currently in sustainment. The Army still has classified and sensitive financial activity remaining in legacy systems that cannot be processed in the fully-fielded GFEBS system; therefore, GFEBS-SA is an essential financial program designed to enable the auditability that is needed to comply with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), and prevent compromise of data that could cause grave harm to U.S. forces. To protect sensitive information and enable clean auditability, the Army requires a separate instance of GFEBS operated on a secure network for processing sensitive and classified financial transactions. GFEBS-SA will integrate with GFEBS to provide secure, web-based financial execution and reporting capabilities for the Army's classified and sensitive activities. GFEBS-SA is envisioned as a fully functional GFEBS application operated on a secure network (SIPRNET), leveraging off of the sustained system design and implementation that includes additional performance requirements designed to protect sensitive intelligence operations and special operations missions. It will process Secret Collateral and below information while providing GFEBS capabilities such as distribution and execution of appropriated funds, cost management, financial reporting, and asset management. GFEBS-SA will be implemented and deployed to 3,000 users across 100 locations worldwide. GFEBS-SA will support information exchanges with organizations that support the Army's sensitive activities mission, including cross-security domain integration between SIPRNet and NIPRNet with GFEBS and other system partners. Services will be capable of being upgraded throughout the life of the program in order to incorporate advances in best business practices and technology. The funding requested in FY19 supports continued system development in order to allow communication to other systems supporting the auditability of classified financial data, system hosting in the DISA environment, testing, and pre-deployment activities. Overall, the RDT&amp;E funding in FY19 supports the transition from development to deployment of the GFEBS-SA effort.   

EV4 - General Fund Enterprise Business System Increment II (GFEBS Inc II):  GFEBS Increment II is in support of the Army's Standard Labor Time Tracking (SLTT) Problem Statement approved by the Office of the Secretary Defense (OSD). The program plans to use an enterprise approach for development and deployment consisting of GFEBS, Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), Global Combat Support System Army (GCSS-A), and Logistics Modernization Program (LMP). SLTT is designed to expand on the time and attendance from supporting payroll processing to enable labor tracking for cost of products/services. Currently, the program is repositioning due to funding being reprogrammed to fund higher priority efforts. Two of the original three GFEBS Increment II requirements [Integrated Resource Management (IRM) &amp; Enhanced Financial Integration (EFI)] have been merged into the GFEBS baseline based on a new acquisition approach in accordance with the DoD 5000.75); until a program office is designated as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), GFEBS will request funding for the remaining requirement (Standard Labor Time Tracking [SLTT]) through the Program Objective Memorandum (POM).

GF5 - General Fund Business Enterprise System (GFEBS): GFEBS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program currently in the sustainment phase. It follows the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act, The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS subsumed the capabilities, in full or in part, of financial systems operating in excess of 40 years including the Standard Finance System and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS is used to administer the Army's General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions with virtually real time information. On 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed Wave 1 to end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, and several other organizations. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011, and Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012. Current efforts include sustaining the system and infrastructure, making modifications needed for audit readiness, compliancy, and upgrades required to maintain the system and meet SAP standards. Additionally, GFEBS continues to make changes as requested by the user community through the Process Owners Group; an SES and General Officers level board that prioritizes user needs.  Some of these changes require RDT&amp;E funding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Overall, the RDT&amp;E funding in FY19 supports the transition from development to deployment of the GFEBS-SA effort. 

BACKGROUND: Initial implementation of the GFEBS-SA project did not require development funds beyond FY16. However, based on a detailed analysis of the original System Integrator, an Army determination was made that they could not deliver a solution to meet the GFEBS-SA requirement. The program was restructured with an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 9 September 2016 in alignment with an Army-validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS). A new System Integrator contract began work on 1 May 2017 with a schedule that supports the Army's timeline; minimizing operational risks to the Army's sensitive activity commands.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Procurement dollars for GFEBS-SA will be used for Organizational Change Management System Integrator/Government/Functional roadshows, SAP HANA licenses (for system access and data storage), on-site support, user training, and deployment to all users.

GFEBS-SA OMA requirements are minimal in FY19, and will be covered under the base program. Requirements after FY19 have been incorporated into the FY20-FY24 POM request.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Plan, develop, and manage GFEBS-SA as a separate instance from GFEBS base program on the SIPRNet to support delivery of capabilities for this designated National Security System (NSS) in support of the sensitive activity commands. The GFEBS-SA solution will be acquired as a sole source contract with Accenture Federal Services as a single increment. The contract will be a hybrid of Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, and Cost Plus Fixed Fee CLINs to support development efforts and to encourage Accenture Federal Services to deliver a solution in support of the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army recommendation to accelerate the schedule to ensure operational security and Army audit requirements. The contract was awarded in April 2017.

Software will be developed through a single build to achieve full capability. GFEBS-SA will consist of a single release delivered in a limited deployment (size not capability) to the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) unit, followed by a full deployment to all other users upon successful completion of IOT&amp;E.

The program will require continuous process and product improvements after full deployment. These continuous process and product improvements will require a stream of RDT&amp;E funding to keep the GFEBS-SA system synchronized with the base system by making modifications needed for audit readiness, compliancy, and upgrades required to keep the system up-to-date with SAP standards and Functional Governance Board requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GFEBS Increment II is in support of the Army's Standard Labor Time Tracking (SLTT) Problem Statement approved by the Office of the Secretary Defense (OSD). The program plans to use an enterprise approach for development and deployment consisting of GFEBS, Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), Global Combat Support System Army (GCSS-A), and Logistics Modernization Program (LMP). SLTT is designed to expand on the time and attendance from supporting payroll processing to enable labor tracking for cost of products/services. Labor costs account for over 60% of the Army budget and currently there is no standard process or materiel solution to enable the capture and analytical review of the information. This effort will eliminate redundant labor tracking systems, increase efficiencies, ensure the workforce is the right size and mix, and will be financially auditable. These labor hours will be accurate and the costs associated with this labor will be mapped in a timely manner (especially since some Army organizations are fully reimbursable). By doing this, the Army can terminate other time tracking systems or processes currently being used. Furthermore, it will support the audibility of reimbursable intra-Army work.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GFEBS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program currently in the sustainment phase. It follows the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act, The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS subsumed the capabilities, in full or in part, of financial systems operating in excess of 40 years, including the Standard Finance System and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS is used to administer the Army's General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions with virtually real time information. On 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed Wave 1 to end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, and several other organizations. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011, and Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012. Current efforts include sustaining the system and infrastructure, making modifications needed for audit readiness, compliancy, and upgrades required to maintain the system and meet SAP standards. Additionally, GFEBS continues to make changes as requested by the user community through the Process Owners Group; an SES and General Officers level board that prioritizes user needs.  Some of these changes require developmental funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds design, development and test of primary target acquisition and counterfire radars to automatically detect, locate and classify hostile indirect fire weapons (mortars, artillery, and rockets).  The program directly supports the prioritization, tracking and locating of targets, and dissemination of that information for simultaneous attack of multiple threats.  It provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counterfire target acquisition systems for all types and phases of military operations. Project L86, Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), version AN/TPQ-50 provides 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers. The AN/TPQ-50 and AN/TPQ-53 radars are currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include operational support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).  Project L88, AN/TPQ-53 is a highly mobile radar system that leverages the latest in technology design to accelerate technology infusion and increase range while improving false location rate, reducing obsolescence and increasing reliability. The AN/TPQ-53 provides a system with increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) for locating mortar, artillery and rocket firing positions.

The Fiscal Year FY 2019 Base funding in the amount of $9.856 million will support ongoing AN/TPQ-53 test efforts and Army interoperability certifications (AICs), AN/TPQ-50 and AN/TPQ-53 development and testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation.

Starting in FY 2019, program office core employee labor costs have been moved from RDTE to OMA as part of an OSD auditability directive.
 
This program line also funds development of an integrated Hypervelocity Armament System (HAS), and associated technologies as they mature to support accelerated demonstration and transition of advanced gun weapon systems, command guided maneuverable projectiles, and tactical sensors. The development of HAS would include advancing artillery powder guns firing Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVPs), resulting in next-generation, common, low drag, guided cannon artillery projectiles capable of completing multiple missions with improved cost effectiveness across different gun systems. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow closed-loop targeting of moving and relocatable targets beyond the range of conventional artillery. Current estimates for follow on development efforts achieve transitionable technology solutions by FY 2023.

Fiscal Year FY 2019 Base funding in the amount of $35.617 million will support the continued initiation of accelerated transition planning, contract requirements package development, system evaluation, requirements/specification work, integration development and test plans for the Hypervelocity Armament System. The Army will leverage Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) prototypes and technologies to continue transition from the FY 2018 program into programs of record.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/TPQ-50 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) is a highly mobile radar that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar, artillery, and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect.  It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers and is capable of being deployed in two configurations, standalone or vehicle mounted.  The AN/TPQ-50 system interoperates with mission command systems (MCSs) to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN/TPQ-50 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN/TPQ-50 is currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) funds of $4.194 million will continue the work required to enhance the AN/TPQ-50's capability to address electronic protection against cyber electromagnetic activity (CEMA) and other known, new, emerging and evolving threats identified in the System Threat Assessment Report (STAR).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project L87 The Hypervelocity Armament System (HAS) and associated technologies are composed of advanced gun weapon systems, command guided maneuverable projectiles, and tactical sensors. The development of HAS would include advancing artillery powder guns firing Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVPs), resulting in a next generation, common, low drag, guided cannon artillery projectiles capable of completing multiple missions with improved cost effectiveness. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow closed-loop targeting of moving and relocatable targets beyond the range of conventional artillery. Current estimates for follow on development efforts achieve transitionable technology solutions by FY 2023.

FY 2019 Base funding in the amount of $35.617 million supports the continued initiation of contract requirements package development, system evaluation, develop and integrate advanced gun systems, requirements/specification work, integration development, howitzer gun system integration and test plans. The Army will leverage Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) prototypes and technologies to continue transition from the FY 2018 program into programs of record.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/TPQ-53 Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar System is a highly mobile radar set that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar, artillery, and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect.  It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) and will replace the current AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder Radars.  The AN/TPQ-53 system interoperates with mission command systems (MCSs) to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN/TPQ-53 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN/TPQ-53 is fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funds of $5.662 million will support ongoing test efforts, a tropical regions test, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AN/TPQ-53 leverages technology developed in the multi-mission radar advanced technology objective (ATO) program.  In 2006, the Government awarded a contract following full and open competition for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 radar and the purchase of four non-recurring engineering (NRE) radars.  Twelve additional quick reaction capability (QRC) radars were purchased under the same contract in response to an urgent directed procurement in July 2008.  The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the acquisition of up to 20 more QRC radars.  Twenty systems were procured through two separate contract actions in 2010 and 2011.  A competitive production contract for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems was awarded in 2012 and options for additional systems were awarded in 2013, 2014, and 2015.  Production and delivery of all QRC/Initial Production (IP) systems are complete, and production of LRIP systems is ongoing.  A Full Rate Production (FRP) decision was obtained in December 2015.  The FRP contract to fill the remainder of the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) was awarded in March 2017.  Additionally, all initial production systems will be retrofitted to the FRP configuration.  The AAO was increased to 189 systems in May 2017; 142 systems have been procured to date. The FRP system deliveries will continue through fiscal year (FY) 2021.  The system will replace all of the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 systems in the fleet.


The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funds of $5.662 million will support ongoing test efforts, a tropical regions test, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element contains five projects:  

Project S65 - Soldier Power:   Soldier Power enables dismounted Soldiers to efficiently execute missions for longer durations by reducing the logistical burden associated with fuel and primary (disposable) batteries.  Platoon Power Generation (PPG) - PM E2S2: This project supports the demonstration and development of a PPG. The Small Unit Power (SUP) PPG (1kW Generator) will provide small units with sufficient portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8). It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices.   

Project EY2 - Integrated Soldier Power Data System - Core:  Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core, Conformal Wearable Battery, Squad Power Manager (SPI) fills the power and energy gaps created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as situational awareness displays, GPS systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices.  

Project EY3 - Soldier Power Generator (SPG) -  fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential and power consuming devices, by providing a single charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. SPG is intended for use in the most austere operating environments providing the Soldier with energy independency for extended mission duration.  The system will provide the Soldier with a lightweight, worn or carried power generation capability, integrated within the warfighters combat load.  

Project EY4 - Universal Battery Charger:  Universal Battery Charger (UBC) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, by providing a sole charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries.  

Project DX7 - Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS):  TCAPS enables Soldiers to communicate over radios in combat environments while simultaneously providing hearing protection from both steady state and impulse noise.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Description:  The Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS) and TCAPS-Lite provide Soldiers with advanced, active hearing protection that simultaneously protects Soldiers' hearing while enabling situational awareness and mission command. TCAPS protects Soldiers against harmful impulse and steady state noises characteristic of combat environments while also enabling Soldiers to communicate with each other using voice communications over a tactical radio, while TCAPS-Lite provides protection for Soldiers without a radio. Both systems enhance survivability and situational awareness by allowing Soldiers to amplify faint sounds that would not be otherwise audible or intelligible. TCAPS and TCAPS-Lite reduces Soldiers noise induced hearing damage and includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.

TCAPS and TCAPS-Lite contribute to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injuries. TCAPS Program of Record will continue to employ commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions that are evaluated periodically. The commercial solutions that meet the technical requirements and are rated the best by the Soldiers will transition to production and fielding.

Justification: FY19 RDTE funding supports continued testing and evaluation of enhanced protective hearing devices for soldiers in combat environments. Funding also supports annual efforts to relook technology for improved future capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier Power Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core, Conformal Wearable Battery, Squad Power Manager (SPI) fills the power and energy gaps created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as situational awareness displays, GPS systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices. Specific systems of SPI are the Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core (ISPDS-C), the Conformal Wearable Battery (CWB) and the Squad Power Manager (SPM). This RDT&amp;E line develops power sources and solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier, but for the team and squad. These power solutions are intended for use in the most austere operating environments and include, but are not limited to, individual Soldier worn systems, integrated power management, and renewable energy. SPI systems will enable dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions more efficiently, for longer durations and with fewer battery resupplies. SPI systems will also reduce the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries, and allow dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort is consistent with the Soldier Protection Capability Development Document (CDD) (March 2011), Operational Energy Initial Capabilities Document (26 April 2012), the Small Unit Power CDD (26 September 2013), and the SPM, ISPDS-C with Conformal Central Power Source Capability Production Document (May 2017).

Justification:  FY19 RDT&amp;E continues to develop power sources and solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier, but for the team and squad. These power solutions are intended for use in the most austere operating environments and include, but are not limited to, individual Soldier worn systems, integrated power management, and renewable energy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Pursue a variety of Soldier power initiatives under full and open competition. These initiatives range from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to developmental efforts. The type of solicitation depends on the maturity of the technology. The power initiatives will be evaluated through scheduled test and evaluation events, and if successful, selected for procurement and subsequent fielding and sustainment. The acquisition strategy varies by product. For example, the SPM acquisition strategy will consist of two phases: Phase one includes the purchase of test articles using the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Special Operational (Spec Ops) Equipment Tailored Logistic Support Program (TLSP). Phase two includes the procurement of additional test articles through Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts established through the Army Contracting Command (ACC). The Project Manager office will establish IDIQ contracts to support the SPI requirements over time. Each SPI system will be procured under purchase orders for production quantities that will be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  Award developmental contracts for intra-soldier wireless technology through the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier Power Generation (SPG) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential and power consuming devices, by providing a single charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. SPG is intended for use in the most austere operating environments providing the Soldier with energy independency for extended mission duration.  The system will provide the Soldier with a lightweight, worn or carried power generation capability, integrated within the warfighters combat load.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY18, funding for Universal Battery Charger realigned from Program Element: 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem/Val)/Project S65 (Soldier Power).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Universal Battery Charger (UBC) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential and power consuming devices, by providing a single charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. The UBC charging solution is suited for the squad and platoon and intended for use in the most austere operating environments.  The system can draw power from wall outlets, vehicle power, and solar power sources. The UBC enables dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions with fewer battery resupplies, thus reducing the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries. The UBC capability also allows dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train.  Funding will develop vehicle integration kits that allow the UBC to be mounted on Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV), Family of Military Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV), Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) and the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) platforms. This effort is consistent with the Operational Energy ICD (26 April 2012) and the Universal Battery Charger CPD (27 May 2015).  Milestone C Full Rate Production decision occurred 17 July 2017.

Justification: FY19 RDTE funding develops the Transit Case Adapter and tests UBC Lite.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier and Small Unit Power (SUP) enables dismounted Soldiers to efficiently execute missions for longer durations by reducing the logistical burden associated with fuel and primary (disposable) batteries. Power solutions address energy deficits resulting from increased power demands associated with providing the Soldier with increased situational awareness displays, Global Positioning System (GPS) systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices. The Soldier and Small Unit Power system develops and tests power sources and solutions suited for the individual Soldier, team, squad, and platoon in the most austere operating environments, while also providing dismounted Soldiers the ability to execute their missions more efficiently, for longer durations and with fewer battery resupplies. An integrated Soldier power system will provide the Soldier with a wearable power supply that will be significantly more efficient than carrying separate batteries for each device. Soldier power systems will also reduce the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries, and allow dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle,  or supply train. SUP develops systems that consist of the Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core (ISPDS-C), Conformal Wearable Battery (CWB), Squad Power Manager (SPM), Universal Battery Charger (UBC), and Soldier Power Generation (SPG) Technologies. Develops and evaluates additional sources of power such as individual Soldier worn systems, renewable energy, and kinetic energy harvesting technologies. This effort is consistent with the Sep 2013 Small Unit Power CDD, the Dec 2011 Operational Energy ICD, and the Mar 2011 Soldier Protection CDD, and the Universal Battery Charger CPD (May 2015).

Justification: Soldier and Small Unit Power will continue to develop and test power solutions for the ISPDS, UBC, CWB, SPM and SPG technologies for fielding to Army Brigade Combat Teams.

Platoon Power Generator - PM E2S2: This project supports the demonstration and development of a Platoon Power Generation (PPG).  The Small Unit Power PPG (1kW Generator) will provide small units with sufficient portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8).  It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices.  It will provide sufficient power to recharge and power all Platoon equipment and fulfill residual power gaps at the Squad and Soldier level.  The generator will provide Platoon power for charging batteries when away from vehicles in all Brigade Combat Teams (Stryker, Armor and Infantry), Rangers and Special Forces in austere environments.  FY 2019 funds will be used to continue the EMD Phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Soldier and Small Unit Power

In FY17 Pursued a variety of Soldier power initiatives under full and open competition. These initiatives range from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to developmental efforts. The type of solicitation depends on the maturity of the technology.  The power initiatives will be evaluated through scheduled test and evaluation events, and if successful, selected for procurement and subsequent fielding and sustainment. The acquisition strategy varies by product. For example, the SPM acquisition strategy will consist of two phases:  Phase one includes the purchase of test articles using the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Special Operational (Spec Ops) Equipment Tailored Logistic Support Program (TLSP).   Phase two includes the procurement of additional test articles through Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts established through the Army Contracting Command (ACC). The Project Manager office will establish IDIQ contracts to support the SUP requirements over time. Each SUP system will be procured under purchase orders for production quantities that will be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. Funding realigned to Projects EY2 and EY4 starting in FY18.

PEO CS/CSS Effort on the Platoon Power Generation - PM E2S2:

Will use Other Transactional Agreement (OTA) contract vehicle culminating in an EMD award of up to two (2) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts supporting an 18-24 month Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  Two selected contractors will be awarded EMD contracts and will separately fabricate and produce the minimum order of 10 Small Unit Power Platoon Power Generation (1kW Generator) systems (5 per vendor).  The selected vendors will produce 5 additional systems to undergo developmental test (DT), a logistics demonstration (LD), pre-production qualification test, and limited user / operational test (LUT/OT). Upon successful completion of these tests and completion of logistics supportability, the performance data and Soldier's feedback will be utilized in preparation for Milestone C (MS C) 4th Qtr FY20</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project XU9 (Active Protection System) is a continuation of efforts previously executed under PE 0203735A - Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Current ground combat vehicle platforms and tactical wheeled vehicles within Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) lack the ability to effectively detect, track, divert, disrupt, neutralize, or destroy incoming direct or indirect fired threat munitions.  Current solutions to defeat these threats, Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Slat armor, do not provide preemptive or active protection and impose secondary blast hazards to crew, dismounted soldiers, and adjacent vehicles and equipment.  The Suite of Vehicle Protection Systems - EMD Program Element (0604852A) will develop and mature solutions to increase the protection of the Army's ground systems from both current and next generation direct or indirect fired threat munitions.  

The Active Protection System Project (XU9) will install and characterize Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Active Protection Systems on Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker demonstrator vehicles.  The Active Protection System effort will assess the maturity, performance, and integration risk of NDI Active Protection Systems, develop and refine Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker Active Protection System installation kit designs, and build prototypes necessary to conduct performance and safety testing to obtain an Active Protection System Urgent Materiel Release (UMR).  The Active Protection System NDI effort will also serve to inform the Vehicle Protection Suite Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).

The Vehicle Protection Suite (VPS) Project (FE8) will design, mature, and evaluate combinations of active, reactive, and passive solutions and leverage both Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) principles and the Army's Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) to develop tailored vehicle Survivability Sets that will mitigate existing protection gaps, allow for future technology insertion to meet evolving threats, and minimize the impact to the current capabilities hosted on Army ground system platforms.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Current ground combat vehicle platforms and tactical wheeled vehicles within Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) lack the ability to effectively detect, track, divert, disrupt, neutralize, or destroy incoming direct or indirect fired threat munitions.  Current solutions to defeat these threats, Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Slat armor, do not provide preemptive or active protection and impose secondary blast hazards to crew, dismounted soldiers, and adjacent vehicles and equipment.

Vehicle Protection Suite (VPS) will design, mature, and evaluate combinations of active, reactive, and passive solutions and leverage both Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) principles and the Army's Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) to develop tailored vehicle Survivability Sets that will mitigate existing protection gaps, allow for future technology insertion to meet evolving threats, and minimize the impact to the current capabilities hosted on Army ground system platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Active Protection System Project (XU9) is a continuation of efforts previously executed under PE 0203735A - Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs.

The Active Protection System (APS) installation and characterization effort will evaluate platform (Abrams, Bradley, Stryker) performance with an Non-Developmental Item (NDI) APS solution installed.  Platform performance evaluation includes APS sensor assessments, minimum live threat characterization, surface danger zone characterization, co-site mitigation (antennas/radiators), electromagnetic interference assessment/characterization, energetic radiation assessment, and a durability assessment.  The NDI APS installation and characterization is being executed through a partnership between the US Army, NDI APS solution vendors, and prime contractors for Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker vehicles.  NDI APS vendor support, to include procurement of demonstration hardware, is contracted on a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) basis, while platform prime contractor technical support is provided on a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis.  The results from the installation and characterization effort will inform FY18 decisions to pursue the additional prototyping and testing necessary to obtain Urgent Materiel Releases (UMR) for NDI APS systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. It replaces all howitzers in all missions in the USMC and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 15 miles and assisted projectiles to 19 miles. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 25 miles with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms. The combination of titanium structures and the use of hydraulic systems resulted in a significant weight savings of 7000 lbs over the M198 system. Compared to the M198, the LW155 emplaces three-times faster and displaces four-times faster. It traverses 32 percent more terrain worldwide and is 70 percent more survivable than the M198. It is a successful joint service program between the Marine Corps and Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer. The LW155 was first introduced into the Marine Corps in April 2005 and the Marines have now fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army has fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades and National Guard. Fielding of the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) commenced in FY14 and will continue through 2018. The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan, receiving high marks for its performance. Having now been in the field for over 10 years, the howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system.  

Funding supports engineering studies for capabilities identified in the Joint U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for the Advanced Towed Cannon System but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity, cost and schedule as well as government sustainment activities requiring RDTE. This includes an extended range cannon;  digital direct fire sight; advanced power solutions; electric elevation drives and auto loader to achieve full operational requirements. Efforts in FY2015-FY2018 center on researching technical solutions while efforts in FY2019-FY2023 will involve developing technology demonstrator prototypes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Systems include the  Deployed Theater Accountability System, Range Facility Maintenance Support System and the electronic Military Personnel System.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the Personnel Transformation - Enterprise Service Bus and GoArmyEd.
 - Personnel Transformation (PT) - Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) - The Army's Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) provides a data integration service in which data can be extracted from the legacy human resource systems and transferred to DIMHRS.  The ESB will be a middleware application which will  provide a single interface to and from the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between the Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) , the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems to create more streamlined systems in support of the military mission and personnel transformation goals. 

 - GoArmyEd is an Army Continuing Education System (ACES) program that provides the virtual gateway for soldiers to request Tuition Assistance (TA) and Department of the Army (DA) civilians to request training funds online, anytime for classroom, distance learning, and online college courses.  GoArmyEd is a dynamic online portal that automates many of the paper-based processes historically conducted in-person at Army Education Centers.  GoArmyEd includes automated registration tools that enforce TA policies and procedures.  GoArmyEd is used by authorized users to pursue their post secondary educational goals: Army Education Counselors to provide educational guidance; CPMS and TMs to manage civilian training and Colleges to deliver degree and course offerings and to report user progress.

Modernization initiatives address continued improvements related to the integration of new users and decreasing reliance on the help desk. GoArmyEd is the Army's enterprise education solution. GoArmyEd has integrated the Reserve Component (USAR and National Guard) and the Department of the Army Civilians. In addition, GoArmyEd is working to add a new data warehouse for HQ data retrieval and user self help tools. Education benefits are paramount to recruiting and retention of quality Soldiers, Civilians and Families.

Commanders Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD) began with the identification of capability gaps arising out of the 2010 Red Book and 2012 Gold Book, two extensive studies directed by senior army leadership to examine suicide prevention (Red Book) and the Army's health and discipline (Gold Book). The studies illustrated that Commanders faced capability gaps in their ability to identify high risk behavior and risk factors, analyze soldier and unit risk, and identify risk trends and develop intervention strategies. CRRD is capable of tracking high risk behavior patterns within a Commander's unit, coupled with a complete picture of high risk behavior of individuals will allow Commanders to take a more proactive mitigation approach through unit level training as well as individual interventions. The implementation of the CRRD will decrease the number of resources and steps involved in gathering data and providing Commanders with risk related information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The dashboard will provide Commanders in all Army components with the capability to obtain information regarding the soldier?s previous disciplinary actions, both civilian and UCMJ as well as the information regarding the health of the Soldier.  This information will enable the Commander to gain additional inputs on the Soldier?s background, allowing the Commander to adjust their leadership and counseling approach to improve the Soldier?s wellbeing therefore increasing their ability to perform their duties.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Installation Support Modules (ISM) consists of four standardized, web based, custom-developed enterprise wide applications that integrate essential installation business practices and processes throughout the Army, to meet Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) Brigade Combat Team readiness and deployment requirements.  Three modules support human resources business functions (In/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over $9 billion combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory.  The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. 
  
Coalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 05.  

Army Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicide attempts are collected and stored in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement.   ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.

ISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Funding supports research and development to comply with Department of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.0 million. 

FY 2019 Base funding in the amount of $2.505 million will continue to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development Coalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) and will continue development of the Army Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) System interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The MC4 System fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed Service members' medical treatment to include pre- and post-deployment screening and its associated medical surveillance.  The MC4 System supports other Soldier protection initiatives by providing data for analyses which can be used for identification and development of critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing, integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Effort has also been initiated to integrate MC4 with the Army Chief Information Office (CIO) Network 2020 and Common Operating Environment (COE) and as a program of record in the Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment Working Group.  Funding provides engineering, developmental testing, and integration of information management/information technology to support Force Health Protection in accordance with the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.

FY 2019 Base funding in the amount of $4.404 million will be used for the engineering effort required to evaluate initiatives that improve the performance of the Defense Health Medical Systems (DHMS) Electronic Health Record software on the Army platform, as well as the engineering effort for other Army unique capabilities.  Activities include:
--Research of technologies to integrate electronic health record software into Army future information infrastructure
--Compliance with emerging Army network and cloud computing requirements (Army Cloud Computing Strategy and Common Operating Environment) 
--Evaluate and test new hardware solutions to meet evolving mission requirements and replace obsolete equipment
--Develop and test hardware solutions for Army unique capability requirements (Point of Injury, Store and Forward, Telehealth, etc.)
--Coordinate research and development activities with Research partners (United States Army Medical Research Materiel Command and United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MC4 Program supports a number of Army Medical Information Technology/Communications initiatives. The near and mid-term focus of the MC4 program is to engineer, design, integrate, test, acquire and field the Army automation infrastructure capabilities supporting fielding of the Defense Healthcare Management Systems Electronic Health Record integrated software application suite, future modernized capability, and other Army requirements.  The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components.  Since Electronic Health Record software is a major component of the MC4 System and being developed in increments by the Joint Program, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and planned upgrades.  The MC4 Program works with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities.  These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date.  This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and planned upgrades.  This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities, and forward into the future with a fully modernized system.  Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, cloud computing capability environment, etc.) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available.  Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and planned upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Increment II will then begin the connection of live, authoritative Army databases to the Acquisition data warehouse.  Once the business processes and external data sources are providing the data: visualization tools can be utilized to provide key charts/views that support Army Staff (ARSTAFF) processes such as Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Weapon System Review (WSR), Strategic Portfolio Analysis and Review (SPAR), and budget execution drills. Supporting efforts include business process evaluation and definition to maximize efficiency of the Software integration process. Completion of Increment I PM Tools software integration, demonstration and evaluation of the PM Tools in a 6-9 month pilot event within a minimum of one PEO.  Funding also supports further acquisition integration of external data sources as required.  Further focus will concentrate on delivering more common data views and analytical capabilities to support decision making at Product Manager (PdM), Program Manager (PM), Program Executive Officer (PEO), ASA (ALT), and at ARSTAFF levels. Key events include the PM Tool pilot evaluation and a FP Tool deployment decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).

Human Resources Command will continue effort for CCIMM and JCIMS for Financial Audit Readiness Requirement and technical requirements gathering, analysis and documentation to allow TRADOC to conduct the Analysis of Alternatives for the RIE.</r2:Text>

Data Services mission consists of automatic data processing in support of USMEPCOM, the Selective Service System (SSS) and other external agencies for both peacetime and mobilization requirements. MIRS directly supports mobilization in the event of a military draft, through electronic links with the SSS and its ability to process and ship. USMEPCOM/MIRS is the only DoD organization legally authorized to collect civilian, medical and testing data for purposes of processing into military services and is the only DoD joint support system used to enforce congressional, DoD and Armed Forces qualification criteria for enlistment.  USMEPCOM has established interfaces with US Citizenship and Immigration Services to verify citizenship status for applicants of military service to screen out undesired or security threat and Federal Bureau of Investigation for background screening using digital fingerprints to eliminate people with criminal records from entering military service. USMEPCOM's IT sustainment effort will maintain MIRS and the associated network certification and accreditation until the end of system lifecycle.  MIRS was scheduled to be replaced by the Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS).   VIPS program cancellation has placed USMEPCOMs legacy IT infrastructure at high risk. The resultant system leaves a non-compliant and non-networthy accession system with processing gaps that need to be addressed for secure, compliant, sustainable, and reliable capabilities to meet DoD and Service requirements.  USMEPCOM must continue toward security and data integrity regulatory/security compliance (PII and HIPAA) or lose Authority to Operate.

Customers/beneficiaries of this investment include the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI) including components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, USMEPCOM and OSD (P&amp;R). 
Stakeholders include: All Uniformed Services, Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Transportation Management Office, USD P&amp;R, USD Intel, Defense Manpower Data Center and Department of Veterans Affairs.
Requested funding mitigates inefficient system sustainability and scalability through an update of the applications underlying database, operating system and middleware software.  The current legacy system requires time consuming and expensive efforts to make operational changes (even minor ones) to military accessions processing to meet DoD and individual Services requirements. MIRS operational processes exist in a system where business rules and workflow are hard coded throughout the system.  Any changes require extensive review and analysis of the code to see what is impacted before a change can be made, then extensive testing afterwards to make sure it works correctly throughout the accession process.  Currently there are over 600 Problem Reports (PR) and System Change Requests (SCRs) pending. 

The requested funding also provides for the development of the Defense Digital Service's (DDS) Minimally Viable Product (MIRS 1.1) and its integration with existing applicant processing applications and the incorporation of MHS GENESIS with USMEPCOM's applicant processing systems. Lastly, funding will be used to develop a full-scale replacement for MIRS/MIRS 1.1, if deemed necessary.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Force Information Management (GFIM):  GFIM will provide the Army an enterprise, integrated authoritative force management capability for lifecycle management of force/organizational structure data for the entire Army.  In addition, it will establish a common data standard for force structure data by implementing the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI).  

The Army Training Information System (ATIS) will provide a common operational picture (COP) of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities. Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats. Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of training information systems that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting visualization, understanding, and informed decision making.  

CRRD began with the identification of capability gaps arising out of the 2010 Red Book and 2012 Gold Book, two extensive studies directed by senior army leadership to examine suicide prevention (Red Book) and the Army's health and discipline (Gold Book). The studies illustrated that Commanders faced capability gaps in their ability to identify high risk behavior and risk factors, analyze soldier and unit risk, and identify risk trends and develop intervention strategies. CRRD is capable of tracking high risk behavior patterns within a Commander's unit, coupled with a complete picture of high risk behavior of individuals will allow Commanders to take a more proactive mitigation approach through unit level training as well as individual interventions. The implementation of the CRRD will decrease the number of resources and steps involved in gathering data and providing Commanders with risk related information.

The Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to preserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System - Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities.

The Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&amp;E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).

The Defense Language Software Upgrade will perform a major modification to the Universal Course Authoring Tool (UCAT).  The modification will enable the tool to allow the curriculum development department to author new curricula without having to know a programming language, such as HTML. Currently, the tool has limited authoring templets and doesn't support the higher language levels or contain testing templets.  The tool will do the programming automatically in the proper format for online viewing regardless of the mobile device used to view the material.  This will enable the author to input the content in a predetermined way and the program will convert it into the proper online format. There will also be programming support to develop and convert existing online material into the current formats for use with all mobile devices regardless of the operating system used. Our current online material does not support all mobile devices and it needs to be reprogrammed to support all current mobile devices regardless of the Operating System (OS) used (Android, Apple, Microsoft).  The Defense Language Institute (DLI) doesn't have the capability to do any programming modifications to existing programs. The programs are in need of modifications to meet DLI's new graduation standards of 2+/2+.
      
The Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.   It includes a new effort in FY 2014, the Army Contract Writing System, a replacement for the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS).

Army Career Tracker (ACT) is a leader development tool created to change significantly the way training, education, and experiential learning support is provided to Army enlisted, officers, civilians, and their leaders/supervisors.  Users can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership.  ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now.  ACT allows users to manage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals.  ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning.  The unique inter-relationship between the user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and the Army's success.  ACT comprises over 780,000 users with an adoption rate of 4,000 users per week.  HQDA EXORD 054-12 ISO Army Transition mandates that leaders utilize roles in ACT to promote life-long learning and development opportunities throughout the Soldier's lifecycle of service (hire to retire).

Criminal Information Management System (CIMS): CIMS, formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG).  Through CIMS, the USACIDC and the OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program / system that houses both classified and unclassified Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data.  CIMS leverages existing and future Army Law Enforcement (LE) enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) providing Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence functions as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  The Consolidated Operations Police Suite (COPS) was previously comprised of five separate applications: two of these applications have been rationalized under ALERTS; the remaining three (related to the Army Corrections discipline) require modernization to ensure continued function and security compliance. RDT&amp;E dollars are required to further enhance &amp; enable CIMS' consolidation/rationalization of LE applications thereby providing the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime while also facilitating the management of those placed in corrections facilities.  At present, all requested CID RDT&amp;E funding will be applied to CIMS initiatives.

Educational Outreach Initiative:  The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC), a subordinate element of USACIDC, requires funding for educational outreach initiatives including internship positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral candidate levels. The DFSC was designated as the leader for forensic science disciplines (DAPM Memo 4 Oct 2011). This memorandum states that the DFSC will establish a forensic RDT&amp;E program that provides the integration of joint operational research, including procedures for establishing customer requirements, and identifying gaps and needs that lead to RDT&amp;E priorities. The program includes developing a scholarly environment across the Defense Forensic Enterprise through the use of educational partnerships, internships and fellowships to facilitate participation in RDT&amp;E projects.  The Educational Outreach program provides an opportunity for students to contribute to forensic science research and influence shared research priorities across forensic science communities, while simultaneously supporting DFSC laboratory operations. Through the internship program, innovative research is conducted that supports research capabilities across the entire range of defense forensic operations (traditional laboratory, expeditionary (forward-deployed) laboratories, and reach-back functions).  

Research &amp; Development Identified through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Initiative:  The DFSC requires funds to coordinate the execution of forensic research projects that will enhance the capability of forensic science applications for DoD customers both in traditional law enforcement/criminal justice settings as well as in expeditionary environments.  The DFSC staff manage federally-funded research &amp; development contracts identified through a two-year, rolling BAA procedure.  The BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals.  Submitted BAA research proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984" (and subsequent applicable amendments).

Financial Integrated Reporting Environment (FIRE): FIRE is a U.S. Army Material Command (AMC) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system currently deployed at the Armament, Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC). FIRE supports the funding and manpower required to accomplish ARDEC's reimbursable workload. RDTE is required to develop and expand the system as an enterprise solution across all AMC reimbursable activities. This strategy is in line with existing Army Portfolio Management System (APMS) and Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) Objectives.

Regional Level Application Software (RLAS) is a critical IT application to the AR managing the automated military pay, funds control, training calendar management and administrative records management for 198,000 Soldiers. 

Army Software Marketplace (ASM): ASM will enable the Army to have a centralized location to store software applications and application metadata.

                                <r2:Description>The Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to preserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System ? Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities. .</r2:Description>

The PPB BOS system standardize and integrate the transactional information systems used in the Headquarters Department of Army (HQDA)  Programming and Budgeting processes.   The program is streamlining programming and budgeting business processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The PPB BOS architecture reengineers, streamlines, and consolidates HQDA systems and financial feeder systems; aligns to the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA); implements powerful business intelligence analytical tools to support strategic planning, programming, and budgeting within HQDA; and provides access to GFEBS funds management and execution data through system interfaces with required SFIS compliancy integral to the PPB BOS data model.  The LEAP program will provide criminal intelligence querying and reporting capabilities in compliance with regulatory and policy standards for Army Law Enforcement regarding investigation of felony crimes.  LEAP captures criminal case investigative information regarding incidents, location descriptors, entities (name, social security number, rank, title, physical characteristics, sex, birth place, and date), agent assignment, crime description and identifiers, statements, property data, laboratory tests; verifies and stores this data for criminal intelligence purposes: and reports this information to the proper authorities from the Division Commanding Officer to the United States Grand Jury.  The system will extract necessary data for consolidation and input to Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) monthly reports, National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) monthly reports and the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII) daily updates.  The LIMS system will automate business processes that support the forensic examiners. These processes include, but are not limited to, analytics, materials management, management reporting, Freedom of Information Act requests (FOIA), legal discovery request, court preparation and outsource processing.

Civilian Personnel Online - Portal (CPOL-Portal) is a one stop secure site which provides Army civilian employees and HR specialists access to a private portal with a complete set of employment related resources, links and web based applications that require single sign-on access - Army Regional Tools (ART). CPOL-Portal will provide an Integrated Management System (IMS) in support of Civilian Workforce Transformation (CWT). It will support Civilian human capital decision making and allow leaders and
employees to perform their roles more efficiently in support of Army goals and missions. CPOL Portal will provide the full spectrum of IT application support and access to Acquire, Develop, Distribute and Sustain components of the Army Civilian HCM Life-Cycle and link to G3 'Structure' IT Enterprise Applications.

It provides classifiers and managers capability to create, edit, and verify position descriptions.  Also it offers robust search, report generation, and lookup &amp; support capabilities.

The Overseas Entitlement Tracker (OET) provides the capability to accurately track Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). LQA is provided to reimburse employees for suitable, adequate living quarters at posts where the U.S. Government does not provide quarters. OET also tracks these other overseas entitlements for employees: Advance Pay, Danger Pay, Imminent Danger Pay, Foreign Differential, Home Leave, Post Allowance, Separation Maintenance Allowance, and Temporary Quarters Subsistence Allowance.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Modernize IT legacy systems across Army IT domains by adapting/improving government off the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and new software development to perform various tasks in a networked environment. These efforts include Army Contract Writing System (ACWS), Army Training Information System (ATIS), Soldier Management System (SMS), Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD), the Army Strategic Readiness Update (ASRU), Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP),Educational Outreach Program, R&amp;D Broad Agency Program, Program Planning Budget Execution (PPBE) - Business Operating System (BOS), Automated Orders and Resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base -Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), KEYSTONE Retain System, Army Contract Writing System (ACWS), Army Mapper, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).

ACWS strategy is to perform all requisite activities to concurrently develop pre-milestone A/B documentation and perform pre-solicitation/source selection activities to meet the USD AT&amp;L timelines for building a contract writing system to replace legacy contract systems to include the Standard Procurement System (SPS).

ASMIS-R is comprised of legacy modules (applications) that require modernization to maintain their relevancy to the Army in support of mishap reduction. As stated above, these are primarily related to meeting minimum DoD regulatory requirements related to the collection of mishap information, safety information storage, and resolving inefficiencies in data quality control and information flow.

Additionally, advances in technology allow for improvements in performance and data integrity that currently are deficiencies in the system. ASMIS-R, in its current state, does not provide any IT (material solution) to the business requirements identified above. The Command has utilized a FFP contract to execute specific Task Orders to develop the tools and products through mid-year FY 2015. The CRC will be competing a new contract vehicle to support the development of products and tools from midyear FY 2015 through FY 2019.

HQDA AG-1 Civilian Personnel (CP) Systems' Acquisition Strategy - The HQDA AG-1 Civilian Personnel (CP) office, Civilian Information Services Division (CISD) Chief and Program Managers will manage these modernization efforts and will utilize the HQDA AG-1 CP's Configuration Control Committee (CCC), Configuration Control Board (CCB), and Integrated Product Teams (IPT) to ensure the appropriate functionality is implemented into OET, CPOL Portal, and FASCLASS.  Development tasks will be performed by AG-1 CP's contractor staff, whose performance is monitored according to the Quality Assurance Surveillance Program. In addition, unit testing and operational testing will be implemented to ensure the new functionality performs as required.  This work will be performed on a firm- fixed- price contract vehicle.

GFIM will leverage an existing Force Management System Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with CACI to execute development efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Remarks>Global Force Information Management (GFIM):  GFIM will provide the Army an enterprise, integrated authoritative force management capability for lifecycle management of force/organizational structure data for the entire Army.  In addition, it will establish a common data standard for force structure data by implementing the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI).  

Army Training Information System (ATIS) is an enterprise system that will provide a common operational picture of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities.  These capabilities will enable commanders, leaders, soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess training requirements so they can more effectively plan, prepare, execute, and assess training. End result is an ATIS that enables soldiers to train as they fight so they can effectively fight as they have trained. 

Adapt/improve/install/field government off the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and new software to perform various tasks in a networked environment such as data warehousing, force management, personnel, installation and environmental databases and applications to support Business System Transformation and Installation Management, to include Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard.

The Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&amp;E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).

Criminal Information Management System (CIMS): CIMS formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the Criminal Investigation Command (CIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG). Thru the CIMS, USACIDC and OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program / system that  houses Classified and Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data, leveraging existing and future Army LE enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system, known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS), provides US Army Law Enforcement stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of Law Enforcement and criminal intelligence (CrimIntel) functions; as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements. RDT&amp;E dollars are required to further enhance ALERTS and other CIMS systems to continue the consolidation/rationalization of LE applications, and to give the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime.

Educational Outreach Initiative:  The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC), a subordinate element of USACIDC, requires funding for educational outreach initiatives including internship positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral candidate levels. The DFSC was designated as the leader for forensic science disciplines (DAPM Memo 4 Oct 2011). This memorandum states that the DFSC will establish a forensic RDT&amp;E program that provides the integration of joint operational research, including procedures for establishing customer requirements, and identifying gaps and needs that lead to RDT&amp;E priorities.</r2:Remarks>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to reserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System - Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ASMIS-R is comprised of legacy modules (applications) that require modernization to maintain their relevancy to the Army in support of mishap reduction. As stated
above, these are primarily related to meeting minimum DoD regulatory requirements related to the collection of mishap information, safety information storage, and
resolving inefficiencies in data quality control and information flow.

Additionally, advances in technology allow for improvements in performance and data integrity that currently are deficiencies in the system. ASMIS-R, in its current state,
does not provide any IT (material solution) to the business requirements identified above. The Command has utilized a FFP contract to execute specific Task Orders
to develop the tools and products through mid-year FY 2015. The CRC will be competing a new contract vehicle to support the development of products and tools from
midyear FY 2015 through FY 2019.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Comment:  0308610A (OMA) Funding will be used for the Operations and Maintenance support of IPPS-A, which includes civilian salaries, program office contractor office support, travel and training for program office personnel, software license renewal, and Help Desk support.  

B66706000 (OPA) Funding will be used for initial system implementation and fielding of IPPS-A to include new equipment training (NET). Training delivery methods include Instructor-led Training, Distance Learning, and Computer Based Training of 13,000 personnel in FY 2019.  Training products will be developed using the Oracle Usability Productivity Kit to include instructor manuals and lessons plans, as well as, Electronic Performance Support System and job aids.  The deployment approach will implement pre-deployment activities at each location beginning 360 days in advance of deployment start date.  Deployment will include on-site data conversion, workflow verification, and "over-the-shoulder" support.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>IPPS-A Increment II will be developed in accordance with DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 12 requirements and will deliver fully integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components (Active, National Guard, and Reserve), building on the trusted database delivered by the IPPS-A Increment I program.  IPPS-A Increment II will consist of four releases (Releases 2.0-5.0).  Each release will build upon the previous release, providing pre-defined personnel and/or pay capabilities.  IPPS-A will pursue a single Milestone (MS) B decision at the start of Increment II and a separate Authorization To Proceed (ATP) at the start of each subsequent release.  Each release will also hold separate Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews prior to the start of development and test activities.  Increment II Full Deployment Decision is anticipated at the conclusion of Release 4.0 when the system will provide integrated personnel and pay capabilities. IPPS-A achieved MS B on 14 December 2014.

Release 2.0-Standard Installation/Division Personnel System (SIDPERS): Begins in FY 2015 and delivers capability in FY 2018 building upon Increment I capabilities.  Provides the functionality from PeopleSoft necessary to subsume the SIDPERS system for all ARNG locations.  End-to-end Business Process development considerations will be evaluated to support various activities to include, but not limited to, promotions/demotions, training requirements, member benefits, duty status, and unit level manning. 

Release 3.0-Accountability and Essential Personnel Services: Begins in FY 2017 and delivers capability in FY 2019 supporting accountability and essential personnel services necessary to subsume numerous legacy field systems including Electronic Military Personnel Office (eMILPO) and Total Army Personnel Database-Reserve (TAPDB-R).  IPPS-A will establish a consolidated system that provides accountability and tracking of all personnel to include deployed Soldiers.  It will allow Commanders in the field to access timely, accurate, and standardized personnel data for Soldiers in all components and provide the necessary means to identify Soldiers who should be on a payroll.  In addition to delivering most of the functions required to establish an Army-wide HR system, Release 3.0 will bring HR payroll drivers on board to enhance accuracy of pay, credit for service, and benefits. IPPS-A will serve as the authoritative data source for all personnel within the system. 

Release 4.0-Pay Services: Begins in FY 2017 and delivers capability in FY 2020 focusing on pay services and building upon Release 2.0 and 3.0 to provide the basis for the fully integrated personnel and pay system.  IPPS-A will incorporate pay functionality to include, but not limited to, base pay, taxes, allowances, bonuses, allotments and leave.  At deployment, Release 4.0 will serve as the authoritative data source for all personnel and pay transactions within IPPS-A and will be able to produce initial data in support of Army audit goals. 

Release 5.0-Personnel Services: Begins in FY 2018 and delivers capability in FY 2020 focusing on the personnel services not yet addressed by the previous releases.  Specifically, it will incorporate remaining functions related to record evaluation and retention management along with certain predominant manual activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the materiel solution for replacement of the Army's Armored Personnel Carrier (M113) Family of Vehicles (FoV) within the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). It will mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability across the Spectrum of Conflict. The AMPV will replace five mission roles currently performed by the M113 FoV by transferring the current M113 Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) to a new Military Vehicle Derivative (MVD) platform. In total, the AMPV FOV will account for approximately 30% of the ABCT's tracked fleet and consists of the following five variants:

1. Mission Command (MCmd) Vehicle: This platform enables effective mission command planning and execution for both the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and Tactical Command Vehicle (TAC) versions of the MCmd. It will host current Battle Command Systems, future replacements, and upgrades of hardware and software.
2. Medical Treatment (MT) Vehicle: This platform will provide a protected surgical environment, with adequate lighting and accessible medical equipment. It will provide a capability for immediate medical care for one patient by a medical crew of four.
3. Medical Evacuation (ME) Vehicle: This platform will conduct ambulance type activities and provide casualty evacuation for up to four litter or six ambulatory patients, with a crew of three medical attendants.
4. General Purpose (GP) Vehicle: This platform will operate throughout the battle space by conducting re-supply, maintenance, casualty evacuation, and other tasks within the formation.
5. Mortar Carrier (MC) Vehicle: This platform will provide immediate responsive fire support to conduct fast-paced offensive operations.

The AMPV program has been initiated on the basis of a Capability Development Document (CDD) that was approved on 21 June 2013 and subsequently revised on 24 October 2016. The CDD reflects a set of stable, technologically achievable requirements. A Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was held on 9 December 2014 and it was followed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) that was signed on 22 December 2014. The ADM approved MS B for the AMPV program and entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. In addition, the ADM authorized the Army to proceed with award of the EMD prime contract, which occurred on 23 December 2014 to BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments, L.P. (BAE). The FY2019 Planned Program consists of completion of EMD testing (including all Development Testing and the Limited User Test), completion of the System Verification Review / Production Readiness Review, completion of the program level Milestone C Review, continued efforts related to Logistics Support products (including completion of a Logistics Demonstration, completion of the entire Technical Manual validation, and the start of Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) verification), and initiation of efforts that support Production Qualification Testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Prime contractor activities in FY2018 will consist of efforts that support the conduct of system level tests and efforts that are necessary as a result of the tests. In addition, the contractor will continue work related to Logistics/Product Support. All 29 prototypes will undergo testing in FY2018, with tests often occurring simultaneously at multiple locations. The contractor will support these tests by providing Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to assist in repairing and maintaining the prototypes and by providing Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to troubleshoot any issues that might arise during testing. As required, the contractor will update the AMPV designs to address any shortcomings that are uncovered during testing or to incorporate any updates to government performance requirements. A Corrective Action Period (CAP) is planned for late 1QFY2018 through late 2QFY2018. During the CAP, the contractor will incorporate any design changes that are deemed necessary. An Interim Design Review (IDR) will be conducted at the conclusion of the CAP. The IDR will demonstrate that design changes made after the CDR are baselined and the system design is ready for manufacturing. A minimum of seventeen (17) artifacts will be generated by the contractor in support of IDR. Additional system level testing will take place following the CAP. At least 9,950 miles (not including contractor shakedown testing) will accrue during formal government testing prior to the CAP and at least an additional 9,500 miles will accrue following the CAP. Following completion of the post-CAP system level tests, a Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) will occur 4QFY2018. During the FCA, the contractor will demonstrate that the as-tested performance of the vehicles complies with design and interface requirements. Immediately following the FCA, the contractor will support the Limited User Test (LUT) in 4QFY2018. Eighteen (18) of the prototypes will be used during the LUT and the contractor will support the test by having FSRs and Test Engineers (TEs) on site and SMEs on call. Besides ensuring that the prototypes are adequately supported before and during testing, the contractor will provide all facilities, parts, tools, and other support items necessary to conduct a Logistics Demonstration (Log Demo) 2-4QFY2018. The contractor will validate the logistics support package prior to the Log Demo and will ensure that the nine (9) primary objectives of the Log Demo are achieved. The first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract option covers 52 vehicles, 10 of which (2 of each variant type) will support Full-Up System Level (FUSL) live fire testing. The recurring manufacturing cost associated with these 10 live fire assets will be Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funded, while the remaining 42 vehicles will be Procurement funded. Further, the live fire testing is scheduled to begin 2QFY2020 and the lead times associated with select hardware, such as electronic components, is expected to be such that some items must be procured as early as 3QFY2018. In accordance with the Full Funding Policy, the entire procurement cost of the live fire test assets is being budgeted in the fiscal year in which select items are initially procured. Accordingly, the FY2018 cost in this element includes the full recurring manufacturing cost necessary to procure 10 FUSL live fire test assets.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) was funded in Integrated Base Defense (IBD) Program Element: 0205402A EF2 in FY 2016</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>IGSSR-C: The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is an Automated Information System (AIS) program. IGSSR-C has a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities. The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE).

This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations. IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems. The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013. IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) and Sensor CE efforts.

In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. IGSSR-C received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  The acquisition strategy for IGSSR-C was approved on 5 December 2016 by the MDA, which approved plans to leverage a Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia delivery order to develop, integrate and test the Initial Capability (IC).  Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) and Tactical Security System (TSS)  in order to gain programmatic efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) is funded using a Joint budget strategy. Each Military Department (MILDEP) budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&amp;E requirements for joint efforts with the funding annually consolidated into the Army Program Element (PE) for execution. Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 to FY 2019 funding reflects the full JTNC requirement with the consolidated funding from the other Services, while FY 2020 and beyond reflects the Army one-third portion of total program RDT&amp;E funds. Out year funding is held in PE 0605030A by the Army, PE 0605030N by the Navy and PE 0605030F by the Air Force.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The JTNC is responsible for ensuring interoperable, secure, and cost effective waveform and wireless communications by recommending standards, conducting compliance and certification analyses in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) policies, and maintaining a DoD Waveform Information Repository (IR). The JTNC provides: (1) DoD Waveform IR management and configuration control, (2) DoD waveform standards and Software Communications Architecture (SCA), (3) technical analyses of DoD Waveform IR products, and (4) serves as Technical Advisor to the JTNC Board of Directors (BoD).

This mission is executed in conjunction with other government agencies to include the National Security Agency (NSA), the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), and the National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA), as well as the Services. JTNC ensures that interagency work is collaborative and eliminates duplicative capability. The JTNC enables a common software baseline that is hardware agnostic, facilitating hardware and operating system independent capability-based applications, and provides for increased competition for Software Defined Radios.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Joint Tactical Networking Center is funded by all the Services. The Joint Funding Strategy requires each of the three Service Military Departments (MILDEPs) to budget for one-third of the total program approved requirement.  Army funding in FY20 and beyond reflects only approximately one-third of total funding.  Other funding is as follows:

Navy RDTE: 0605030N, 3077.                FY20 = 4,536 // FY21 = 4,644 // FY22 = 4,741 // FY23 = 4,835
Air Force RDTE:  0605030F, 655068.     FY20 = 5,588 // FY21 = 5,700 // FY22 = 5,814  // FY 23 = 5,930

Due to Joint Funding Strategy, there is no prior year funding for JTNC in the other Service lines. Prior to the year of execution, the JTNC funding is consolidated in Army PE 0605030A for execution. In accordance with the Joint Tactical Networking Center Charter updated and re-validated on 29 March 2016, the JTNC will remain under a Joint Budget Strategy funded by the three MILDEPs.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) is classified as a Joint Support Program to Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (AT&amp;L), DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), and the Services. JTNC core functions as defined in the JTNC Acquisition Decision Memorandum and Charter signed on 20 January 2014 and re-validated on 29 March 2016 include: Department of Defense (DoD) Waveform Information Repository (IR) management and configuration control, DoD waveform standards and Software Communications Architecture (SCA), technical analyses of DoD Waveform IR products. The services derived from these core functions reinforce an acquisition environment where wireless communications products are interoperable, secure, and cost effective.

The FY2019 Budget supports continued development/maturation of the DoD Waveform IR, analysis of directed software and artifacts, support of the National Security Agency (NSA) Commercial Communications Security (COMSEC) Evaluation Program (CCEP), and the JTNC Standards Interface Control Working Group (ICWG).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance metrics are tracked and reported as part of the JTNC annual management plan.  The goals, objectives, actions, targets and measurements are coordinated with stakeholders.  Results are reported at regular intervals.  Final accomplishments are reported to the JTNC Board of Directors.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013, Joint Tactical Networks (JTN) was funded in the Navy Program Element (PE) 0604280N (Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)), Project No.3076 (formally known as JTRS Network Enterprise Domain (JNED)). JNED was renamed JTN and the Joint Executive Program Office (JPEO) JTRS transitioned to the JTNC in FY 2013, in accordance with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 11 July 2012. FY 2013 and FY 2014 JTNC funding was provided by the JTN Program via PE 0604280N and PE 0605030A, respectively.

As per the JTNC ADM dated 20 January 2014, JTN and JTNC became separate entities and PE 0605031A (Project Code EF5) was created for JTN.  The 2014 ADM also directed that the waveform development and sustainment responsibilities transition to the Services in 4QFY15.  PdM Waveforms transitioned to PM TR; PdM Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) transitioned to PEO C3T PM Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) PdM Tactical Cyber and Network Operations (TCNO); and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and Link16 transitioned to the Navy.  For FY 2015 and out, the Army PE 0605031 contains only the JTN (Waveforms &amp; JENM) RDT&amp;E funding.  

As part of the joint program budget strategy for JENM, each Military Department (MILDEP) budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&amp;E funds for joint efforts.  Joint funding is held at the Navy PE 0605030N and Air Force PE 0605030F.  Prior to the year of execution, the funding is consolidated in the Army PE (0605031A) for execution.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Tactical Networks (JTN) efforts are executed by PdM Waveforms and JENM . They are responsible for the portable, interoperable, mobile ad hoc networking waveforms and network enterprise services to enhance tactical warfighting capabilities. PdM Waveforms and JENM applications are: (1) Interoperable - among all Services, capable of operating in a variety of hardware items, for both Program of Record and commercial Non-Developmental Item (NDI) radios; (2) Secure - meet all DoD and US Government information assurance requirements; (3) Operationally relevant - quickly and effectively meet evolving network mission requirements of Combatant Commanders and the Services; (4) Affordable - drive down procurement and support costs via a robust, competitive Non-Developmental Item (NDI) market which adheres to open government standards.

In accordance with the Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) and Charter dated 20 January, 2014, the JTN active efforts include Waveforms and JENM. Due to PdM Waveforms extensive knowledge and expertise, PdM Waveforms will continue to enhance, update, and sustain the following Legacy Waveforms on a reimbursable basis: the High Frequency (HF) waveform, the merged HAVE QUICK II (HQII) and Very High Frequency (VHF)/Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Line of Sight (VULOS) waveforms, the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Bowman waveform (JBW), the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveform and the UHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) waveform.

EF5 project: The Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) software provides the ability to plan, monitor, configure and control the Army's Software Defined Radio (SDR) communication networks. JENM configures numerous SDR radios such as the Manpack and Rifleman, enabling them to utilize the Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) waveforms such as the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA), Integrated Waveform (IW), and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveforms. Furthermore, JENM provides the Commander the ability to quickly reconfigure critical networks using its' Over the Air Management (OTAM) functionality. JENM enhances the S6's ability to conduct Course of Action (COA) Analysis and the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) providing commanders critical information regarding their ability to effectively communicate.

EX6 project: Beginning in FY 2018, based on the results of the FY 2017 Army Network Analysis, the EX6 project will refocus efforts to improve waveforms for lower and mid-tier networks.  The effort will focus on development to achieve improved performance, network simplification, improved spectrum efficiency and improved Electronic Warfare (EW)/Cyber resistance.  The planned waveforms may include changes to a mid-tier waveform, SRW 2.0/Narrow Band, and SINCGARS upgrades.  This new capability must be completed by FY20 -21 to support future tactical radio procurements.  

FY 2019 Base RDTE dollars in the amount of $41.972 million supports the continued development of the Waveforms and JENM, testing support and the program management office.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>PE 0605031A contains only the JTN (PdM Waveforms and PdM TCNO (JENM)) RDTE funding.

In accordance with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 11 July 2012, the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Program of Records (PORs) transitioned to Military Department (MILDEP) managed programs. As per the ADM dated 20 January 2014, JTN and JTNC became separate entities. FY 2015 and out, Army PE 0605031 contains only the JTN RDT&amp;E funding.  For FY2018 and out, the continuing JTN efforts are funded in Army PE 0605031A (JTN), Navy PE 0605031N (shared), Air Force PE 0605031F (shared) and USMC (Marine Corps Communications Systems - MCPC: 112107).  As part of the joint program budget strategy, the Air Force and Army budget for approximately one-third each of the total program funds for JENM efforts.  The Navy and USMC funding combined equal the other third of the JENM program funding.  Prior to the year of execution, Navy and Air Force funding is consolidated in the Army PE (0605031A) and software sustainment funds are realigned from RDT&amp;E to O&amp;M,A PE (4326750A) to support the joint program acquisition strategy.  USMC funding will be provided on an annual basis via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).  USMC funding projections are as follows: FY18 - $1.407M; FY19 - $1.118M; FY20 - $1.121M; FY21 - $1.139M and FY22 - $1.392M.
In FY 2017 and out Waveform funding is on the Army PE 0605031A, Project Code EX6.  JENM funding is under Army PE 0605031A Project Code EF5.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>

PdM Waveforms provides the Lower Tactical Internet with a suite of waveforms and network services that are: (1) Interoperable - used by all Services; (2) Capable of operating on a variety of hardware platforms, both Program of Record and non-developmental commercial radios; (3) Secure - meet all Department of Defense and US Government information assurance requirements; (4) Operationally relevant - quickly and effectively meet evolving network mission requirements of Combatant Commanders and the Services; and (5) Affordable - drive down procurement and support costs via a robust, competitive market which adheres to open government standards.  

PdM Waveforms will remain agile to accommodate emerging warfighter needs by refocusing effort strategies to address the following:

  - Engage industry to assess options for Low Probability of Interception/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) waveforms to reduce the signature of the tactical network
  - Pursue alternative waveforms to reduce the complexity of MANET waveforms
  - Improve spectral efficiency
  - Seek Electronic Counter-Counter Measure (ECCM) improvements for operations in contested environment
  - Implement improvements that allow the tactical radios to be operated in a radio silence mode.

FY 2019 Base RDTE dollars in the amount of $30.816 million supports the continued development of the waveforms, testing support, and the program management office.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Software Development efforts within PdM Waveforms are focused on the following:

1.	Cyber Electro-magnetic Activities (CEMA)
CEMA activities focus on impact the adversary?s ability to communicate through voice and data communications.  This also includes protecting and hardening Army capabilities and systems to prevent the adversary from doing the same.  CEMA is not limited to voice and data communications, but also includes tactics such as deception and adversary communication extraction.
CEMA consist of:

     - Cyberspace and Cybersecurity Operations
          * Focused on IP traffic (data)
          * Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention of Army networks within Tactical Radio platforms (HMS, AMF, MNVR)
     - Electronic Warfare (EW) 
          * Focused on Radio Frequency (RF/voice)
          * Electronic Attack (EA)
          * Electronic Protection (EP)
          * Includes Anti-jam protection and deployment
     - Spectrum Management Operations (SMO).
          * Development of capabilities for the warfighter to maintain communication in spectrum denied environments.

2.	SINCGARS
Development of a Frequency Hopping (FH3) mode, which will address the adversary's EA capabilities.
Development of transmission security protocols.

3.	SRW &amp; SRW Narrowband Integration
Development of SRW Narrowband and the integration of Narrowband Code into the SRW baseline support the following warfighter capability gaps:

     - Availability of adequate spectrum to deploy a full Brigade Combat Team of subnets is increasingly becoming a problem in combat environments.
     - Maintaining longer distances between communication nodes 
     - Maintaining communication capabilities in foliage-heavy environments.
     - Operation in VHF and UHF bands with narrower bandwidths.</r2:Description>

Therefore, RDTE funding increases.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PdM Waveforms is responsible for common core activities including developing and updating legacy and networking waveforms that operate on multiple radios sets and in all operational environments that support network-centric operational warfare.  Waveform developments (upgrading, developing, and maintaining) will generally be procured through full and open contract competitions.

Beginning in FY 2018, based on the results of the FY 2017 Army Network Analysis, PdM Waveforms will refocus efforts to improve waveforms for lower and mid-tier networks.  The effort will focus on development to achieve improved performance, network simplification, improved spectrum efficiency and improved EW/Cyber resistance.  The planned waveforms may include changes to a mid-tier waveform, SRW 2.0/Narrow Band, and SINCGARS upgrades.  This  new capability must be completed by FY 2020-2021 to support future tactical radio procurements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System - Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities along with network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. The GBOSS-E Capability Design Document (CDD) was AROC approved May 2014. In FY 2013, FY 2014 &amp; FY 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities.

GBOSS-E received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  Milestone B decision accomplished 29 Sep 2017, the existing United States Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and modified to meet the Army's GBOSS-E program requirements.

The acquisition strategy for GBOSS-E was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 11 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide system design, development, and integration support, as well as a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support future procurements. The Heavy Tower Trailer, EO/IR, and RF Sensor which are the main cost drivers for the system will be competitively awarded through the product office and provided to a prime integrator with the TDP to construct future GBOSS-E systems. 

Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 and will align GBOSS-E, IGSSR-C, and Tactical Security System (TSS) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Security System (TSS) is a modular, scalable, lightweight, rapidly deployable, ground based security and surveillance Family of Systems (FoS). The design of TSS allows for hasty emplacement and is tailorable to support short and long term security, surveillance and detection missions. The TSS and its components are designed to be employed as a stand-alone system, in a layered effort or integrated with additional force protection (FP) systems. Integration with additional sensors will be obtained through network communications and software in line with Net-Ready requirements. TSS will address four of the five base camp core protection/security capabilities identified in the Integrated Base Defense (IBD) Concept of Operations (CONOPS) which are perimeter security, entry control, persistent surveillance, warning and alerting. The TSS will be compliant with the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture and Implementation Plan. TSS is designed to be employed as a stand-alone system in a layered effort or integrated with additional force protection systems including motion, acoustic, seismic, surface, and detection technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Tactical Security System (TSS) will eliminate the Non-Standard Equipment (NSE) currently used in the Force Protection System (FPS) under the Base Expeditionary Targeting and Surveillance System - Combined (BETSS-C) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) with improved surveillance capabilities in modular configurations along with enhanced network integration across the command and control system and Common Operating Environment (COE). In FY2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funding to support pre-milestone B and risk reduction activities.

TSS received Materiel Development Decision (MDD) approval on 6 January 2017.  The acquisition concept and contracting strategy for TSS is pending approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) with plans to leverage an existing task order through Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide engineering and developmental support for the TSS design, development, and integration of an Engineering Development Model (EDM) and to support Operational Assessments (OA). Key efforts include the development of the EDM, testing and evaluation for TSS Key Performance Parameters (KPPs)/Key System Attributes (KSAs)/Additional Performance Parameters (APAs), and Developmental and Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E).

Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E), Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C), and TSS in order to gain programmatic efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) budget line includes CIRCM (EB4), and funding to counter emerging technology as identified in Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) SO-0010 Phase 2a and the Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Directed Requirement for the Advanced Threat Warner Common Infrared Countermeasures Quick Reaction Capability (ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC).

CIRCM (EB4)
The Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) is the next generation lightweight, laser-based Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) component that will interface with
both the Army's Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and future missile warning systems (MWS) to defeat current and emerging missile threats that use multispectral technology for rotary-wing, tilt-rotor and small fixed-wing aircraft across the DoD.  CIRCM receives an angular bearing hand-off from the MWS, employs a pointing and tracking system which acquires the handed-over threat and tracks the incoming missile during and after motor burnout. CIRCM jams the missile by using modulated laser energy in the missile seeker band, thus degrading the tracking capability of the missile and causing it to miss the aircraft.  CIRCM is utilizing Open Systems Architecture which allows flexibility with software and hardware refreshes to keep pace with future threats.  

The CIRCM A-Kit includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft.  The A-Kit
ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.  The CIRCM B-Kit is the mission kit (laser, pointer tracker, and
controller) required to achieve near spherical coverage for an aircraft.

JUONS SO-0010 and ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC
Phase 2a DoN LAIRCM (JUONS S0-0010)  and Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC:  Initially, a select number of aircraft in the threat area of responsibility will be outfitted with the Phase 2a Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system. However, this approach came with a Space, Weight and Power - Cooling (SWaP-C) penalty which is being addressed as a follow-on JUONS solution requirement using the Phase 3 Advanced Threat Warner (ATW) and Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC). The intent of the Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC effort is to reduce the SWaP-C associated with the Phase 2a solution.

FY 2019 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding in the amount of $51.178 million funds continued A-Kit and B-Kit development, and post Milestone C planning and execution of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E). 

FY 2019 RDT&amp;E Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in the amount of $2.670 million will support regression testing efforts related to the Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC effort.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

However, this approach came with a Space, Weight and Power - Cooling (SWaP-C) penalty which is being addressed as a follow-on JUONS solution requirement using the Phase 3 Advanced Threat Warner (ATW) and Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC). The intent of the Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC effort is to reduce the SWaP-C associated with the Phase 2a solution.

FY 2019 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding in the amount of $51.178 million funds continued A-Kit and B-Kit development, and post Milestone C planning and execution of IOT&amp;E. 

FY 2019 RDT&amp;E Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in the amount of $2.670 million will support regression testing efforts related to the Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The December 28, 2011, Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) authorized entry into the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, designated the program a pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), and approved the updated exit criteria.  The August 25, 2015, DAE ADM authorized entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and designated the program as a MDAP.  The EMD contract was awarded to Northrup Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) on August 28, 2015.  The EMD contract includes priced options for Other Platform A-Kit Development, A-Kit Engineering Support, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 1 and 2 Prototypes (Hardware and Installs), LRIP 1 and 2 Engineering and Test Support, Software Technical Data Package (TDP), Navy funded requirements, and Defense Exportability Features (DEF).  Upon CIRCM MS C approval planned for the fourth quarter of FY18, the LRIP and Engineering Support options may be exercised and the program may immediately enter the Production &amp; Deployment phase with First Unit Equipped (FUE) planned for third quarter of FY20, and a Full Rate Production Decision Review (FRPDR) planned for the third quarter of FY20.

Due to the urgency of addressing the SWaP-C penalty issues related to the JUONS SO-0010 initial DoN LAIRCM material solution, the Army approved a Directed Requirement for the ATW and CIRCM systems, which will be a sole source QRC effort with Northrop Grumman.  Northrop Grumman has the required technical capabilities, knowledge and special equipment needed to meet the urgent and compelling need for the ATW CIRCM QRC effort.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The MRDS will support Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Interdiction and Elimination operations, specifically RN Sensitive Site Assessments and Sensitive Site Exploitation. The Joint Point Dosimeter (JPD-I) is intended to replace DoD's legacy dosimeters (the Navy's IM-270 and the Army's PDR-75 reader with the DT-236 watch).

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Man-portable Radiological Detection System is a single step acquisition strategy starting at Milestone C to acquire Commercial-Off-The-Shelf equipment sets consisting of a Hands-Free search device, a Hand-Held Radioisotope Identification Device, an integrated tactical radio network, and a Situational Awareness tool in order to provide specialized Army units with a net-ready, rugged, and reliable system that can detect, identify, and characterize designated radionuclides and transmit that information securely to tactical, operational, and strategic command levels in near-real time.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program provides a Sensor Suite Upgrade (SSU) for the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV). The NBCRV Sensor Suite is the Mission Equipment Package for the Stryker NBCRV and consists of chemical point detectors, a standoff chemical vapor detector, a biological point detector, a chemical vapor sampling system, radiological detectors, and the Sensor Processing Group.  NBCRV SS provides the Stryker NBCRV the ability to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark NBC Hazards. The Stryker NBCRV SSU will improve chemical, biological and radiological and nuclear detection and identification capabilities, and reduce sustainment costs over the current system.  A Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuver speed when conducting NBC missions and increase reliability. In FY18 the CSD program will deliver final prototypes and complete chemical, environmental and on-the-move testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defensive Cyber Tool Development (DCTD) group of programs designs, builds, and tests the advanced Cyber tools and infrastructure that enables active defense of the network from Home Station Mission Command Centers (HSMCC) to the deployed tactical Command Post (CP). This capabilities will enable integration of the Cyber Mission Force (CMF) with the regional and local cyber network defense elements. These tools will provide cutting edge hardware and software, integrated with existing infrastructure and tools to facilitate active Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO). Cyber Tool Development will include data analytics solutions to enable the ability to correlate and analyze the massive amount of data coming across the network and provide timely situational awareness. It will also include development, integration, and testing of Defensive Cyber Tools and infrastructure that will facilitate pushing cyber sensor data to the data analytics engine as well as support remote access to prevent or react to a cyber incident. Defensive Cyber Tool Development includes creation of developmental environments for emerging commercial tool assessment as well as Army Cyber Soldier development of tools. Additionally, this program element supports the development of a Cyber Mission Planning tool that is an application-based, scalable, secure warfighting system to support cyberspace operations mission planning and command. The Mission Planning tool helps identify Cyberspace Key Terrain (KT-C) and determines probable attack vectors; and produces a set of relevant internal defense measures, triggers, and decision points.

This program element will support the start of several DCO programs beginning in FY19 and supports material solutions for the October 2016 Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)  approved  Defensive Cyberspace Operations Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD). The hardware and software capabilities enable Army Cyber defense forces to protect, search and discover, maneuver and engage, and mitigate and respond to enemy cyberspace operations. DCO programs will allow near real-time employment of defensive measures that will allow friendly cyber forces to maintain advantage. These programs directly support US Cyber Command Integrated Priority List #2 Produce Advanced Cyberspace Infrastructure and #5 Defensive Forces to execute passive and active defense operations at net-speed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defensive Cyber Tool Development line will support multiple Information Systems - Requirement Development Packages (IS RDP) that result in multiple programs. The Army will conduct a Materiel Development Decisions (MDD) in FY18 based upon the Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) Information System Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD).

Defensive Cyber Operations Projects will initially be managed as an Acquisition Category III program using Department of Defense "IT Box" strategy and an evolutionary acquisition model.  System designs focus on open architecture and open source capabilities. Development focuses on implementation of a modular design to maximize innovation through continuous releases. Modules will be refined by industry as a component through adoption of prototypes. Each program will have a prime integrator (single contractor) that integrates the new modules. The Government will assess and create prototypes of new modules under the Consortium for Command, Control, Communications and Computer Technologies (C5) Other Transactional Agreement contract vehicle. Monthly technical interchange discussions with C5 members will occur to insure new technologies are inserted as soon as possible and will lead to semiannual fielding decisions for new modules.

 The overall strategy of the Tactical DCO Infrastructure program is to develop the software infrastructure and deployment scripts that provide a solution that is physically and/or logically converged with the Army's Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) to minimize the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements in a Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Tactical Command Post (TCP). The capability will provide pre-positioned infrastructure at echelons Battalion through Corps that enables global, regional, and local cyberspace defenders to conduct DCO mission planning and protection measures. Execution of the TDI program will be a combination of Government entities and commercial vendors.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program is a materiel solution providing software-defined radio systems that are tailorable and scalable to support the Chief of Staff of the Army's "fight tonight" strategy. HMS is an Acquisition Category IC program that encompasses specific requirements to support the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs. 

HMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge/most disadvantaged warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS) / Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radio systems are software reprogrammable, networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communications. 

HMS encompasses the Handheld Radios (one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR) and two-channel Leader Radio (LR)), Manpack Radio (MP), and Small Form Fit (SFF) radios. HMS radios will provide voice and support for data services such as text, control graphics, imagery, video, and telemetry to Warfighters and tactical end user devices including handheld, embedded, and larger computing devices, as well as unmanned systems. The program office will continue with the ongoing competition to procure the newest generation of software defined radios capable of running the threshold waveforms, to include MUOS for MP, and will pursue alternative waveforms to reduce the complexity of Mobile AdHoc Networking waveforms, improve spectral efficiency, and seek Electronic Counter-Countermeasures improvements for operations in contested environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Manpack's Test and Evaluation focuses on the key technical and operational characteristics of the system: Radio Frequency performance, security, Reliability, Availability &amp; Maintainability, suitability and survivability requirements, in addition to operational environmental performance requirements as per the Capability Production Document. All radios awarded a contract were required to go through the Qualification Test (QT) to qualify for a Customer Test (CT). Following CT there will be a Sandbox and Soldier Feedback Study and Field / Lab Based Risk Reduction Test (FBRR/LBRR) that will serve as risk reduction events prior to Operational Test (OT) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers. The QT and CT are complete and were executed by Electronic Proving Ground. 

The QT validated the manufacturers' ability to meet the minimum functional requirements identified in the Performance Requirements Document. All vendors successfully demonstrated key capabilities during QT and proceeded to the CT. The Sandbox, Soldier Feedback Study and FBRR/LBRR will serve as risk reduction events for delayed thresholds and OT. The OT will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary / Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The OT will be designed to validate that HMS products meet warfighter needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment. Results from OT will facilitate the delivery orders for Full Rate Production.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>HMS is structured as a single program of record. The HMS Handheld Radios encompass the one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR) and two-channel Leader Radio (LR). The RR is a handheld radio that connects soldiers at the lowest echelon of the Army network. It is a National Security Agency (NSA) certified Type 1 radio used for transmission of up to SECRET information. The RR provides one-channel secure voice and data communications using Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). It is the primary squad level communication system. The LR is a Multiband two-channel handheld radio to be used at the Team, Squad, and Platoon level. The LR will simultaneously support Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice interoperability, SRW data and voice communications, and other advanced networking waveform communications, in one radio with both handheld and mounted configurations.

On 13 September 2016 the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approved a decreased Basis of Issue (BOI) for the single channel Rifleman Radio (RR), an increase to the BOI for the two channel Leader Radio (LR) and moving forward with acquisition activities for the two channel LR. Single channel RR procurement is being deferred.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Handheld's Test and Evaluation focuses on the evaluation of key technical and operational characteristics of the system: Radio Frequency performance, security, Reliability, Availability &amp; Maintainability, and survivability requirements, in addition to operational environmental performance requirements as per the Capability Production Document. All radios awarded a contract will be required to go through the Qualification Test (QT) to qualify for Field / Lab Based Risk Reduction (FBRR/LBRR) that will serve as risk reduction events prior to Operational Test (OT) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers.

The QT will validate the manufacturers' ability to meet the minimum functional requirements identified in the Performance Requirements Document. Radios that successfully demonstrate key capabilities during QT will proceed to FBRR/LBRR. The OT will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary / Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The OT will be designed to validate that the HMS products meet warfighter needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment. Results from the OT will facilitate the delivery orders for Full Rate Production.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 13 September 2016 the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined to decrease the Basis of Issue (BOI) for the single channel Rifleman Radio (RR), increase the BOI for the two channel Leader Radio (LR) and move forward with acquisition activities for the two channel LR. Single channel RR procurement is being deferred.  An acquisition strategy addendum adding LR was approved in March 2017. The addendum continues the multi-vendor approach utilizing the existing IDIQ RR base contract (awarded 29 April 2015) and lessons learned to award the LR competitive contracts. The LR effort will be a separate competition under the Handheld radio suite. The Program Office released the solicitation for the two channel LR to support Qualification Testing Sept 2017. The Program Office will change the strategy to request objective capabilities, rather than the previous approach of low cost technically acceptable, and seek a best value effort to increase operational flexibility. Rifleman Radio Increment 2 (LR) Capability Production Document (CPD) was JROC approved on April 2017.

The LR will simultaneously run the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), or other advanced networking waveforms, and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).

The Army will award Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts and will procure radios through a multiple step selection process:
a. Award FFP Contracts to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (3QFY18)
b. Award initial delivery orders for FBRR/OT assets (3QFY18)
c. Award FRP delivery orders based on Operational Test and best value trade off construct (3QFY19)</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Effective February 2, 2017 DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) for Defense Business Systems, applying to Army Contract Writing System.  This DoDI supersedes DoDI 5000.02, improving the alignment of business systems to commercial best practices as well as optimizing efficiencies and effectiveness across DoD for the acquisition of business systems.  Decisions rendered by the Milestone Decision Authority, as outlined in DoDI  5000.75, are referred to as "Authority To Proceed (ATPs)" and replace DoDI 5000.02 "Milestones."</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Contract Writing System (ACWS) will be the Army's single, next-generation, enterprise-wide contract writing, management, execution, and close-out software system. ACWS will facilitate the standardization of Army Procurement business processes and streamline the integration with Army Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. As a financial feeder system, ACWS will meet the compliance requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). The system will meet the full scope of Army Contracting requirements, including those in secure and non-secure locations, those supporting combat or non-combat contingencies, those within or outside the borders of the Continental United States, those supporting grants and assistance agreements, and those performing weapons systems, construction, installation, and other specialized contracting activities. This is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed each of the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, Army received an OSD Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 29 October 2014. On 24 March 2016, the USD(AT&amp;L) signed the program's RFP Release Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which designated ACWS as an unbaselined, Major Automated Information System Acquisition Category IAM program, and approved the Army's request to release an RFP to industry to procure a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The purpose of the Risk Reduction (RR) phase, is to fully assess the COTS solution procured as the results of the Full and Open Competition. The assessment will allow the program to award the initial development contract (Release 1) with a high degree of confidence that the program will successfully execute the development and deployment phase. RR will include several key activities conducted in parallel.  First, the program will conduct Global Analysis and Business Blueprinting to optimize the To-Be, End-to-End, Procure-to-Pay processes and business scenarios. The program will define applicable Business Process Designs, identify any gaps between the COTS product and the ACWS requirements and determine how to resolve those gaps.  This will all be done with the goal to align Army processes, as much as possible, to the COTS product processes. This will save significant development dollars.  This phase will also include design of the required interfaces that are not included as part of the original COTS solution. The ultimate goal of this phase is to maintain the COTS baseline and reduce requirement for customization with a plan that allocates capabilities and interfaces across all software builds. The allocated baseline will be reviewed/ approved during a Preliminary Design Review.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Threat Detection Systems (ATDS) is anticipated to be an ACAT I program. It is the next generation fleet-wide threat detection component to the Aircraft Survivability Equipment suite. ATDS will replace the Common Missile Warning System (CMWS). Primary capability achieved through ATDS is the agility necessary to rapidly react to evolving threats. 

Justification:
FY 2019 Base Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $28.580 million fund system development, sensor infrastructure, &amp; algorithm analysis, system engineering program management, and engineering support for an advanced missile warning system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Due to the anticipated proliferation of unexploited threat weapon systems and technically advanced threat weapon systems, the Army requires a Universal Threat Detection (UTD) capability to protect aviation platforms and aircrews on the future battlefield. ATDS is the Army's next generation missile warning system intended to improve individual aircraft survivability against advanced IR homing missiles. ATDS will be a fleet-wide replacement for CMWS.  ATDS will provide enhanced missile warning capabilities for Army rotary-wing, small fixed wing and tilt-rotor platforms and Special Operations rotary wing aircraft.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Survivability Development budget line includes Aircraft Survivability Equipment Development (ER7) and Common Missile Warning System (ER8). This budget line also includes funding for Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) SO-0010 Phase 2a, Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Directed Requirement for the Advanced Threat Warner (ATW) portion of the  ATW/ Common Infrared Countermeasures Quick Reaction Capability (ATW/CIRCM QRC), and the next generation missile warning system.

ER7: Aircraft Survivability Development.
The objective of the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Development project is to improve Radio Frequency (RF) ASE for Army aviation. The APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) detects, categorizes, and prioritizes RF emitters and provides a visual / aural alert to aircrew members warning them of targeting by RF-guided weapons. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward. 

Phase 1 serves as an obsolescence / sustainment upgrade to the Processor Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) of the AN/APR-39A(V) RWR implemented to ensure that the currently fielded system remains viable until an affordable improved RF ASE capability can be pursued in Phases 2 and 3. 

Phase 2 RWR Modernization begins by adopting the United States Navy APR-39D(V)2 system. APR-39D(V)2 will significantly improve the RF threat coverage, automatic detection and identification of threat types, bearing, and lethality. This phase ends upon completion of the Modernized RWR (MRWR) which is an ECP to the APR-39D(V)2 that will implement enhanced hardware upgrades to keep the APR-39D(V)2 technically relevant against agile threats. 

Phase 3 adds active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) jamming capability for selected aircraft; Materiel Development Decision (MDD) for this ECM jamming capability phase is not expected until later in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Base RDT&amp;E funding of $16.163 million supports MRWR development.

ER8: Common Missile Warning System (CMWS).
The US Army operational requirements concept for Aviation Infrared (IR) countermeasure systems is known as the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM). SIIRCM is an integrated warning and countermeasure system to enhance aircraft survivability against IR-guided threat missile systems. The CMWS is a core element of the SIIRCM concept. CMWS is an integrated ultraviolet (UV) missile warning system, with an Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) serving as a subsystem to a host aircraft. 

The CMWS program is a UV missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming IR-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification, unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification, false alarm rejection, and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives UV missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS) and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures, including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM)-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition, the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding materiel release conditions to achieve a Full Materiel Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats. 

The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, cables, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.

Phase 2a DoN LAIRCM (JUONS S0-0010)  and Phase 3 ATW/CIRCM QRC Initially, a select number of aircraft in the threat area of responsibility will be outfitted with the Phase 2a Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system. However, this approach came with a Space, Weight and Power - Cooling (SWaP-C) penalty which is being addressed as a follow-on JUONS solution requirement using the Phase 3 Advanced Threat Warner (ATW) / Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC). The intent of the Phase 3 ATW/CIRCM QRC effort is to reduce the SWaP-C associated with the Phase 2a solution.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) QRC The Phase 4 LIMWS QRC effort is a follow-on bridging solution to the JUONS SO-0010 to fill a global capability gap until the Advanced Threat Detection System (ATDS) Program of Record is fielded. The LIMWS QRC effort provides advance missile detection capability to an increased number of aircraft outside of the Phase 2a and Phase 3 efforts areas of responsibility.

Justification:
CMWS: FY 2019 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $5.802 million fund development engineering of the Threat Analysis Database (TAD), future sensor &amp; algorithm analysis, vulnerability analysis and assessment of technologies (VAAT), and Systems Engineering Process Management (SEPM). 

Phase 3 Advanced Threat Warner and Common Infrared Countermeasure Quick Reaction Capability (ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC): FY 2019 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount of $5.110 million fund System Test &amp; Evaluation (ST&amp;E) and tech manual development.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS): FY19 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount of $29.823 million are estimated to fund test of system and design for lead platform and development of follow-on platform designs.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army RF ASE is managed by Project Manager ASE (PM ASE) for development, testing, procurement, integration and installation on Army rotary wing and small fixed wing aviation platforms. PM ASE proposed a three-phased path forward commensurate with user priorities and affordability considerations. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward.

Phase 1 addresses obsolescence/Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues associated with the currently fielded AN/APR-39A(V) RWR via sole source ECP awarded to the APR-39A manufacturer. 

Phase 2 adopts the United States Navy (USN) APR-39D(V)2 system, limiting service-unique design, test, and integration expenses. Adoption of the APR-39D(V)2 in limited quantity, followed by development, testing, procurement, and fielding of the Modernized RWR (MRWR) will address the significant RF capability gap while avoiding additional up-front costs associated with a single-Service solution. 

Phase 3 will develop and integrate active Electronic Countermeasures jamming capability for select aircraft.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The US Army operational requirements concept for Aviation Infrared (IR) countermeasure systems is known as the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM). SIIRCM is an integrated warning and countermeasure system to enhance aircraft survivability against IR-guided threat missile systems. The CMWS is a core element of the SIIRCM concept. CMWS is an integrated ultraviolet (UV) missile warning system, with an Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) serving as a subsystem to a host aircraft. 

The CMWS program is a UV missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming IR-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification, unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification, false alarm rejection, and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives UV missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS) and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures, including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM)-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition, the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding materiel release conditions to achieve a Full Materiel Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats. 

The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, cables, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.

Phase 2a DoN LAIRCM (JUONS S0-0010)  and Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC Initially, a select number of aircraft in the threat area of responsibility will be outfitted with the Phase 2a Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system. However, this approach came with a Space, Weight and Power - Cooling (SWaP-C) penalty which is being addressed as a follow-on JUONS solution requirement using the Phase 3 Advanced Threat Warner (ATW) and Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC). The intent of the Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC effort is to reduce the SWaP-C associated with the Phase 2a solution.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) QRC The Phase 4 LIMWS QRC effort is a follow-on bridging solution to the JUONS SO-0010 to fill a global capability gap until the Advanced Threat Detection System (ATDS) Program of Record is fielded. The LIMWS QRC effort provides advance missile detection capability to an increased number of aircraft outside of the Phase 2a and Phase 3 efforts areas of responsibility.

Justification: 
CMWS: FY 2019 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $5.802 million fund development engineering of the Threat Analysis Database (TAD), future sensor &amp; algorithm analysis, vulnerability analysis and assessment of technologies (VAAT) and Systems Engineering Project Management (SEPM). 

Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC: FY 2019 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount of $5.110 million will fund System Test &amp; Evaluation (ST&amp;E), technical manual development, and integration efforts to support the Phase 3 Advanced Threat Warner and Common Infrared Countermeasure Quick Reaction Capability (ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC) efforts.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) QRC : FY19 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount 29.823 million are estimated to fund test of system and design for lead platform and development of follow-on platform designs.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CMWS: The acquisition strategy includes buying CMWS B-Kits to support fielding requirements and installation of A-Kits on all modernized aircraft. The previous CMWS production contract was a firm fixed-priced (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. A FFP bridge contract was awarded March 2013 for CMWS hardware. The follow-on CMWS production FFP/Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) IDIQ contract is a 3 year firm fixed price contract to procure the remaining Generation 3 Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and A-Kits and was awarded SEP 2013. The Gen 3 ECU, which provides increased processing capacity and enables unguided munitions detection, became a part of the system in FY 2010; First Unit Equipped (FUE) for the Gen 3 ECU was achieved in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) on 18 September 2013. All aircraft deployed to OEF have received the new processor with hostile fire detection capability. Gen 3 ECUs will gradually replace all Gen 2 ECUs across the Aviation fleet between now and 2018.

JUONS Phase 2a DoN LAIRCM and Phase 3 ATW &amp; CIRCM QRC: JUONS S0-0010 acquisition strategy includes aircraft prime contractor engineering support contracted to a Government test organization. Aircraft integration for JUONS will be handled through government operated organizations and industry partners.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) QRC: Acquisition strategy includes a full and open competition for selection of prime vendor for development of B-Kit and development of A-Kit and support testing for the lead program. Additional platform A-Kit development will be handled by government organizations and industry partners.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funding for FY17 and out has been realigned for IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system development activities from BA4, PE 0604319/DU3 to BA5, PE 0605052/EY7.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the overall integrated Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats for deployed forces.  The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that is designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat the UAS, CM, and RAM threats. The system provides 360-degree protection and simultaneously engages threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach is used to provide this capability. The IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system consists of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM defeat mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I system is transportable by Army Medium Tactical Vehicles (MTV) common mobile platforms.

FY 2019 Base dollars in the amount of $157.710 million are designated for the fabrication and delivery of EMD Assets #7-12, program management/administration, system engineering, hardware and software integration, additional spares and system/subsystem developmental testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This program is an integral part of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An independent Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was completed in FY2015 and the recommendation was made to continue organic development through the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase. The Government will fund the Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), U.S Army Aviation and Missile Command Logistic Center (ALC), and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) to continue the development, manufacturing, and testing of the Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the program.

During the EMD phase, the IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will award tasks on existing contracts for: Sentinel software modification to support Low Slow Small capability; integration of IFPC Inc 2-I software code into the IAMD C2 architecture with IBCS v5.0 baseline fire control software for Initial Operational Test and Evaluation; AIM-9X Block II interceptor software modification; AIM-9X Block II Weapon Interface Controller and Engagement Calculator software development; MML logistics products development; and complete system Critical Design Review.  The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will conduct MML qualification testing and will conduct publication validation and verification, training, logistics demonstration, developmental flight testing, support a cyber security assessment, and initiate MML Production Technical Data Package (TDP) independent assessment. The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will update its Technology Readiness Assessment and receive results from the MML Production TDP assessment to support the Limited User Test, Milestone C, and the Low Rate Initial Production Decision.  The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office has modified its Acquisition Strategy by re-aligning four MML assets, originally designated as part of LRIP, to be test articles for use in IOT&amp;E and other developmental test activities, as required. 

The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will fund AMRDEC to integrate IFPC Inc 2-I software into the IBCS v4.0 baseline to support the Limited User Test, continue component qualification testing, order materials for EMD assets, assemble two MML assets, and support software integration, test and checkout activities in the I2 Lab. 

The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will fund LEAD to fabricate components, assemble, and deliver the ten remaining MML assets.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project FG8 Common Robotic Controller is not a new start effort in FY 2019. In FY 2018, the Common Robotic System, Universal Controller was a subset of the Common Robotic System (Individual) program funded on  PE 0605053A Ground Robotics Project FB4. The effort will transition from PE 0605053A Ground Robotics, Project FB4 Common Robotic Systems in FY 2018 to PE 0605053A Ground Robotics, Project FG8 Common Robotic Controller in FY 2019.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>FB2: The Man-Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) Inc. II is a modular medium-sized system providing a multitude of standoff capabilities through different payloads for the Army. These capabilities include detect and confirm presence, identify, disposition, and counter hazards by providing a platform for payloads in support of current and future mission requirements.  MTRS Inc. II will support current and future payload missions for the Engineer's route clearance platoons, Special Operational Forces (SOF) detachments, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Units.  FY 2019 RDTE funds will enable the MTRS Inc. II program to progress through the EMD phase and into LRIP by funding the following: Production Qualification Test asset procurement, test support, design efforts, contract data procurement, program support, travel, Virtual Clearance Training Suite development, and other expenses related to the MTRS Inc. II RDTE program.

FB3: Robotic Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts. It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interface, common software and common architecture for universal controllers. RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Squad Multi-Equipment Transport (SMET), Tactical Wheeled Vehicle-Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System Type II (RCIS Type II), Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Inc. II, Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP), Common Robotic System (Light Reconnaissance) (CRS(LR))/Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Robotic Combat Vehicle-Robotic Wingman (RCV-RW), etc.) and new standards addressing emerging requirements (i.e. Cyber Security, new autonomous behaviors, new payloads, lethality, etc.).  FY 2019 RDTE funds support the continued development, finalization, and publishing of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Ground (RAS-G) Interoperability Profile (IOP) Version 4.0. IOP V4.0 will provide the required modular open interfaces and compliance test tools for new programs including Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) and Enhanced Robotics Payloads (ERP). Additionally, FY 2019 RDTE supports the robotics portfolio wide analysis of software interfaces between active programs including Universal Controller, MTRS Inc. II, CRS(I), RCIS, SMET and Leader Follower.

FB4: The Common Robotic System - (Individual) (CRS(I)) is the Army's small sized (&lt;25 lbs.) Soldier back-packable, remotely operated, common robotic system.  The system provides dismounted Soldiers with increased standoff capability from hazardous threats.  The system consists of a Universal Controller (UC), a suite of payloads, and open architecture common mobility platform allowing for future capability growth. The CRS(I) will be designed so the operator can quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and/or payloads. The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces. This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the Operating Environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated Warfighting Force by providing standoff to the Warfighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations. FY 2019 RDTE funding support up to two vendors to develop prototypes for submission to government down-select. An option will be issued for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to provide 15 RDTE Production Qualification Test (PQT) articles. This funding also supports a government IPT to provide program management, test and evaluation, and programmatic risk mitigation to address Cyber Security Controls, interoperability (IOP), and analysis of collaborative operations with various Unmanned Systems (i.e. MTRS Inc. II, Light Reconnaissance, Short Range Reconnaissance UAS, etc.) assigned at Battalion and below. 

FB6: Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) will help to reduce Soldier loads by transporting mission specific equipment, resupply equipment, and supplies required for extended operations.  The SMET  will be capable of carrying the equipment currently required to support Infantry and Engineer Platoons in the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) for a 72 hour mission without resupply. The SMET will reduce Soldier load, increase squad mobility during combat operations and dismounted maneuvers. SMET will have open architectures, a remote control, support casualty evacuation, power generation/offload and chemical/biological payloads. FY 2019 RDTE funding supports the development and purchase of Technical Insertions, Logistics Support Data, and SMET Program of Record (POR) production contract to include the Statement of Work (SOW) and Request for Project Proposal (RPP). FY 2019 RDTE funding also supports Developmental testing at Aberdeen and the completion of the Technology Demonstration. Program support to include salaries, travel and miscellaneous expense for the SMET program will also be funded.

FB7: The Robotics Enhanced Program (REP) uses a "buy/lease, try, and inform" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents as well as support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.  FY 2019 RDTE funds for the REP will be utilized to fund Iteration 19.1 and 19.2 and out-of-cycle iterations which will fund salaries, travel, ERDC and ATEC support, RDECOM support, CoE support, Battle Lab support, and associated experiments. REP will also prepare for and complete Knowledge Point 3 (KP3) in 4QFY19, which will provide a status of the REP to the Program Executive Officer.

FB8: The Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS) provides a near term solution to three Army Warfighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver.  The SBS provides the small unit  "quick look" capability when higher echelon assets are unavailable and time is of the essence.  The system is simple to use, expendable, and deployable in a matter of seconds to support the squad leader's decision-making process.  The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions. 

FB9: The MTRS Standardization project provides the platforms to support integration and testing of payloads and technology for non-standard unmanned ground robotics systems used by Army Engineers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) and Special Operational Forces (SOF) units.  Current system characteristics include the following: a remote controlled articulated arm with a gripper, operating range up to 800 meters, multiple illuminated cameras, a pan/tilt surveillance camera, two-way radio, and a ruggedized operator control unit.  The platforms provided will support development and testing of the following capabilities:  High Dexterous Manipulation System (HDMS), Multi-Spectral Image Fusion System (MIFS), and Precision Aimed Multi-shot Disruptor (PAMD).  The use of robotics allows the first approach, to potentially explosive hazards, to be made by a robot rather than a Soldier.  FY 2019 RDTE funding supports the development of a library of robot parts that can be 3D printed via additive manufacturing.  The funding will also test the operational compatibility of the 3D printed parts with robot platforms.  

The Common Robotic System, Heavy (CRS(H)) is a modular large-sized system that provides enhanced protection to the EOD Soldier in order to support the Joint Force Commander with the ability to identify, render safe and dispose of explosive ordnance (EO) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of the Range of Military Operations (ROMO) and Home Land Defense (HLD) operations.  CRS(H) will also enable EOD Soldiers to execute Defense Support of the Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations in response to requests from federal, state, local, and tribal authorities for domestic incidents, emergencies, disasters, designated law enforcement support and other activities. CRS(H) will support current and future missions for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) units. FY 2019 RDTE funds will enable the CRS(H) program to progress into the EMD/LRIP phases by funding the following: Production Qualification Test asset procurement, test support, design efforts, contract data procurement, program support and engineering, travel, and other expenses related to the CRS(H) RDTE program. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for CRS(H) robots is 225. FY 2019 funding will also be utilized to support Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP) program initiation.

FG8: The Common Robotic Controller/Common Robotic System (Universal Controller) (CRS(UC)) provides the capability to individually and/or concurrently control multiple Unmanned Systems (UxS) platforms and control/monitor a mesh network without having to obtain and/or carry separate Operator Control Unit (OCU)s for each system. A controlled UxS may be mobile or stationary, can be smart learning, and self-adaptive. Two CRS(UC)s will be used to hand-off control of a system to a receiver, reducing hand-off time and the need for the UxSs to have multiple OCUs. The CRS(UC) will also be capable of "hot swapping" batteries where one of its two batteries can be replaced without the system being shut down, halting mission progress, and use current or new Soldier power sources that will maximize its operational time and minimize the number of replacement batteries needed for most missions. The controller will also use haptic indicators inside the hand grips to give the user active feedback of the controlled system's movements if the UxS software is programmed to use them. If and when the use of lethal systems on the CRS(UC) is approved, the weaponized payloads will be controlled via several fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge.  The intent of this requirement is allow the Soldier at battalion and below to use the Common Robotic System (Universal Controller) to operate unmanned aerial systems (e.g. Raven, PUMA, Short Range Micro (SRM), Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System (LMAMS), Autonomous Aerial Resupply, etc.) and unmanned ground vehicles  (e.g. CRS(I), CRS(V), CRS(H), SMET, MTRS INC II, Light Reconnaissance (LR), Wingman, etc. ). In addition, the project will investigate backwards compatibility for the non-standard equipment robots (e.g. FirstLook, SUGV, Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS), MTRS MK II, etc.).  FY 2019 RDTE funds will be utilized to conduct user testing and select a Universal Controller.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Robotic Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts. It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interface, common software and common architecture for universal controllers. RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Squad Multi-Equipment Transport (SMET), Tactical Wheeled Vehicle-Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System Type II (RCIS Type II), Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Inc. II, Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP), Common Robotic System (Light Reconnaissance) (CRS(LR)/Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Robotic Combat Vehicle-Robotic Wingman (RCV-RW), etc.) and new standards addressing emerging requirements (i.e. Cyber Security, new autonomous behaviors, new payloads, lethality, etc.).  

Fiscal Year 2019 RDTE supports the continued development, finalization, and publishing of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Ground (RAS-G) Interoperability Profile (IOP) Version 4.0. IOP V4.0 will provide the required modular open interfaces and compliance test tools for new programs including Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) and Enhanced Robotics Payloads (ERP). Additionally, FY19 RDTE supports the robotics portfolio wide analysis of software interfaces between active programs including Universal Controller, MTRS Inc. II, CRS(I), RCIS, SMET and Leader Follower.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2019 the Common Robotic System, Universal Controller effort will transition from PE 0605053A Ground Robotics, Project FB4 Common Robotic Systems to PE 0605053A Ground Robotics, Project FG8 Common Robotic Controller.

In FY 2018 funding for Common Robotic Systems (CRS) transitioned from PE 0604641A Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle, Project DV7 Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle to PE 0605053A Ground Robotics, Project FB4 Common Robotic Systems.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)) is the Army's small sized (&lt;25 lbs.) Soldier back-packable, remotely operated, common robotic system.  The system provides dismounted Soldiers with increased standoff capability from hazardous threats.  The system consists of a Universal Controller (UC), a suite of payloads, and open architecture common mobility platform allowing for future capability growth. The CRS(I) will be designed so the operator can quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and/or payloads. The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces. This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the Operating Environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated War-fighting Force by providing standoff to the Warfighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations. 

FY 2019 RDTE funding support up to two vendors to develop prototypes for submission to government down-select. An option will be issued for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to provide 15 RDTE Production Qualification Test (PQT) articles. This funding also supports a government IPT to provide program management, test and evaluation, and programmatic risk mitigation to address Cyber Security Controls, interoperability (IOP), and analysis of collaborative operations with various Unmanned Systems (i.e. MTRS Inc. II, Light Reconnaissance, Short Range Reconnaissance UAS, etc.) assigned at Battalion and below.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FY 2019 RDTE funds Operational Technology finalization, System downselect and Program of Record (PoR) Full Material Release testing. 

Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) will help to reduce Soldier loads by transporting mission specific equipment, resupply equipment, and supplies required for extended operations. The SMET will be capable of carrying the equipment currently required to support Infantry and Engineer Platoons in the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) for a 72 hour mission without resupply. The SMET will reduce Soldier load, increase squad mobility during combat operations and dismounted maneuvers.  SMET will have open architectures, a remote control and support casualty evacuation, power generation/offload and chemical/biological payloads.

FY2019 RDTE funding supports the development and purchase of Technical Insertions, Logistics Support Data, and SMET Program of Record (POR) production contract development to include the Statement of Work (SOW) and Request for Project Proposal (RPP). FY2019 RDTE funding also supports Developmental testing at Aberdeen and the completion of the Technology Demonstration. Program management costs to include salaries, travel and miscellaneous expense for the SMET program will also be funded.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) assessment effort was completed as part of the Robotics Development effort under the Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (654641DV7) funding line in FY2017. This supported a rapid start to establish an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement supporting the Directed Requirement, signed 14 April 2017. The OTA began with a Request For Project Proposal (RPP), followed by an evaluation and down select to 10 vendors in FY17 as part of the Robotic Enhancement Program under the Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (654641DV7) funding line. In FY18 a down select from 10 to 4 vendors decided which platforms would participate in a 12 month Technology Demonstration. This Technology Demonstration will guide the development of the Capability Production Document (CPD) leading to a Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) decision in 3QFY19.

It is the Army's intent to maximize the use of an Open Systems Architecture (OSA), as well as the approved Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) interoperability profiles for SMET. The PdM plans to gather sufficient data during the SMET Technology Demonstration to reduce development efforts and provide cost savings by incorporating the developed SMET technology into the Program of Record. Throughout the life of the program, the Army will continue to survey the marketplace to identify opportunities for technology insertion and required payloads, relying on competition to drive down costs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Robotics Enhanced Program (REP) uses a "buy/lease, try and inform" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.  

Fiscal Year 2019 RDTE funding for the REP will be utilized to fund Iteration 19.1 and 19.2 and out-of-cycle iterations which will fund salaries, travel, ERDC and ATEC support, RDECOM support, CoE support, Battle Lab support, and associated experiments.  REP will also prepare for and complete Knowledge Point 3 (KP3) in 4QFY19, which will provide a status of the REP to the Program Executive Officer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS) provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver.  The SBS provides the small unit "quick look" capability when higher echelon assets are unavailable and time is of the essence.  The system is simple to use, expendable, and deployable in a matter of seconds to support the squad leader's decision-making process.  The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Post Milestone C, the program office intends to assess whether to leverage non-developmental technologies with each tranche (every two to three years) as tech insertions or to re-compete off the open market.   This allows the warfighter to have the most current technology on the market.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MTRS Standardization project provides the platforms to support integration and testing of payloads and technology for non-standard unmanned ground robotics systems used by Army Engineers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) and Special Operational Forces (SOF) units.  Current system characteristics include the following: a remote controlled articulated arm with a gripper, operating range up to 800 meters, multiple illuminated cameras, a pan/tilt surveillance camera, two-way radio, and a ruggedized operator control unit.  The platforms provided will support development and testing of the following capabilities:  High Dexterous Manipulation System (HDMS), Multi-Spectral Image Fusion System (MIFS), and Precision Aimed Multishot Disruptor (PAMD).  The use of robotics allows the first approach, to potentially explosive hazards, to be made by a robot rather than a Soldier.

This project will also support the development of a library of robot parts that can be 3D printed via additive manufacturing.  The funding will also test the operational compatibility of the 3D printed parts with robot platforms.

The Common Robotic System, Heavy (CRS(H)) is a modular large-sized system that provides enhanced protection to the EOD Soldier in order to support the Joint Force Commander with the ability to identify, render safe and dispose of explosive ordnance (EO) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of the Range of Military Operations (ROMO) and Home Land Defense (HLD) operations.  CRS(H) will also enable EOD Soldiers to execute Defense Support of the Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations in response to requests from federal, state, local, and tribal authorities for domestic incidents, emergencies, disasters, designated law enforcement support and other activities. CRS(H) will support current and future missions for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) units. FY 2019 RDTE funds will enable the CRS(H) program to progress into the EMD/LRIP phases by funding the following: Production Qualification Test asset procurement, test support, design efforts, contract data procurement, program support and engineering, travel, and other expenses related to the CRS(H) RDTE program. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for CRS(H) robots is 225. FY 2019 funding will also be utilized to support Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP) program initiation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Project FG8 Common Robotic Controller is not a new start effort in FY2019. In FY 2018, the Common Robotic System, Universal Controller was a subset of the Common Robotic System (Individual) program funded on  PE 0605053A Ground Robotics Project FB4. The effort will transition from PE 0605053A Ground Robotics, Project FB4 Common Robotic Systems in FY 2018 to  PE 0605053A Ground Robotics, Project FG8 Common Robotic Controller in 2019.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Robotic Controller/Common Robotic System (Universal Controller) (CRS(UC)) provides the capability to individually and/or concurrently control multiple Unmanned Systems (UxS) platforms and control/monitor a mesh network without having to obtain and/or carry separate Operator Control Unit (OCU)s for each system. A controlled UxS may be mobile or stationary, can be smart learning, and self-adaptive. Two CRS(UC)s will be used to hand-off control of a system to a receiver, reducing hand-off time and the need for the UxSs to have multiple OCUs. The CRS(UC) will also be capable of "hot swapping" batteries where one of its two batteries can be replaced without the system being shut down, halting mission progress, and use current or new Soldier power sources that will maximize its operational time and minimize the number of replacement batteries needed for most missions. The controller will also use haptic indicators inside the hand grips to give the user active feedback of the controlled system's movements if the UxS software is programmed to use them. If and when the use of lethal systems on the CRS(UC) is approved, the weaponized payloads will be controlled via several fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge.  The intent of this requirement is allow the Soldier at battalion and below to use the Common Robotic System (Universal Controller) to operate unmanned aerial systems (e.g. Raven, PUMA, Short Range Micro (SRM), Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System (LMAMS), Autonomous Aerial Resupply, etc.) and unmanned ground vehicles  (e.g. CRS(I), CRS(V), CRS(H), SMET, MTRS INC II, Light Reconnaissance (LR), Wingman, etc. ). In addition, the project will investigate backwards compatibility for the non-standard equipment robots (e.g. FirstLook, SUGV, Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS), MTRS MK II, etc.).

The CRS(UC) is defined in the Common Robotic System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Capability Development Document (CDD) and is included in the CRS(I) acquisition.  A standalone Capability Production Document (CPD) is being developed to allow CRS(UC) to have a standalone funding line allowing for improving alignment with future programs.

FY 2019 RDTE funds will be utilized to conduct user testing and select a Universal Controller.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Common Robotic Controller/Common Robotic System (Universal Controller) (CRS(UC)) provides the capability to individually and/or concurrently control multiple Unmanned Systems (UxS) platforms and control/monitor a mesh network without having to obtain and/or carry separate Operator Control Unit (OCU)s for each system. A controlled UxS may be mobile or stationary, can be smart learning, and self-adaptive. Two CRS(UC)s will be used to hand-off control of a system to a receiver, reducing hand-off time and the need for the UxSs to have multiple OCUs. The CRS(UC) will also be capable of "hot swapping" batteries where one of its two batteries can be replaced without the system being shut down, halting mission progress, and use current or new Soldier power sources that will maximize its operational time and minimize the number of replacement batteries needed for most missions. The controller will also use haptic indicators inside the hand grips to give the user active feedback of the controlled system's movements if the UxS software is programmed to use them. If and when the use of lethal systems on the CRS(UC) is approved, the weaponized payloads will be controlled via several fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced Soldier, ground, aviation, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence &amp; Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems and equipment.
The Primary goal is to take technologies to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 and 8 through a collaborative and accelerated acquisition process. Technologies will be demonstrated in relevant environments, performing tactical/operational scenarios. Efforts will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability within one to five years. Efforts will include accelerated material development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs in Cyber; Electronic Warfare (EW); Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Survivability and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical Program of Record capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements, and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.
The Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders' needs. The Army RCO was established per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT: Establishment of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, signed by the Secretary of the Army: Eric K. Fanning, dated 11 August 2016.
The RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally. Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.   

The RCO capabilities focus areas are:
Cyber
Electronic Warfare (EW)
Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT)
Survivability
Operational Needs Statements (ONS)
Any other operational needs that become a priority as designated by the Army Board of Directors (BOD)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort selects technologies that show high promise for advancing and accelerating capabilities required under acquisition programs and develops and evaluates associated prototypes for accelerated identification, assessment, and transition to an acquisition program for production and fielding. It also demonstrates integrated technologies within a high fidelity and realistic operating environment and transitions them to a formal program of record on an accelerated basis. This effort also includes analysis, integration and evaluation of emerging capabilities on air and ground platforms to reduce risk and support technology insertions.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army RCO capitalizes on current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to address emerging threats and high impact capability opportunities of U.S. Army Forces deployed globally. This is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and 2) developing emerging deployable capability through research and development organizations, academia, and industry. The RCO uses streamlined acquisition methods, processes and techniques to rapidly acquire capability; these methods vary by project. The Rapid Capabilities Office will have a dedicated contracting staff, with the flexibility to use both traditional and non-traditional contracting approaches. To reach non-traditional vendors, RCO will use non-standard contracting methods, such as Other Transaction Authority instruments. Where practicable, prototypes will be acquired using competitive procedures. Projects will be transitioned to an approved acquisition program for production and sustainment. Operational assessments will be conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation, prototype maturation, and future capability development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The AMF radios are software programmable, multi-band, multi-mode, mobile ad hoc networking radios, providing simultaneous voice and data communications for Army Aviation platforms.  The radios will operate in networks supporting the Common Operating Picture, Situational Awareness, and interoperability of Mission Command systems throughout the battlefield.  AMF radios will ensure the Soldier's ability to communicate both horizontally and vertically via voice and data within all mission areas and Common Operating Environment.  AMF radios will operate waveforms that are deployed by Joint Forces today, and will introduce networking waveforms to the Aviation community that will enable interoperability between air and ground forces and transport operational and Mission Command information through the tactical network.  AMF radios will help close capability gaps by extending data networking to company and below echelons, enabling network services to the platform and connecting Army Aviation platforms to Army ground and Joint air network domains. 

Per MDA direction, the AMF Program will procure radios as Non-Developmental Items. FY 2019 RDTE funding allocated to SANR (Project EG6) supports planned program activities, such as, source selection testing and acquisition activities in support of contract award and continued development of documentation to support Milestone C.  As part of the CSA Network Review, the Network Cross Functional Team (CFT) is reviewing the current network portfolio, to include review of the SANR program path and Capability Production Document.  The SANR Program path forward is expected to evolve based on outcomes of the CSA Network Review and Network CFT efforts, as part of a modernized Army network.

FY 2019 RDTE funds also support the procurement of Link-16 handheld radios for experimentation and concept refinement for air-ground integration, in coordination with the Network CFT.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Prior to FY 2014, the Airborne Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) was funded under Navy PE 0604280N, aligned under the Navy JTRS Programs. In accordance with a July 11, 2012 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), the JTRS Program of Record transitioned to a Military Department-managed program. AMF is now managed by Program Executive Office Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, under Project Manager Tactical Radios, and funded by Army PE 0605380A. On May 2, 2014, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, issued an ADM that designated Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) and Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) as subprograms under the AMF Program. In FY 2015, Project EA9 represented the total Airborne Maritime Fixed Small Airborne (AMF-SA, or SALT) RDT&amp;E budget. In FY 2016, funding was allocated between the SALT (Project EA9) and SANR (Project EG6) subprograms.  The SALT subprogram was closed out during FY 2016.  Only the SANR subprogram (Project EG6) is funded in FY 2017 and beyond under AMF JTRS.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Per MDA direction, AMF JTRS will procure SANR radios as Non-Developmental Items (NDI).  The SANR is a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency Type 1 certified networking radio providing seamless real-time information for operation in mobile and dynamic combat environments that will meet tactical communications requirements as validated by the Army Aviation community.  SANR will provide increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms via advanced networking capabilities supporting Mid-Tier and Lower Tier tactical networks, and maintain Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capability.  SANR will replace the current SINCGARS radios on Army Aviation platforms.  SANR is planned for implementation on the following platforms: Apache (AH-64E), Black Hawk (UH-60V, UH-60M, HH-60M, and MH-60M), Chinook (CH-47F and MH-47G), and Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (MQ-1C) aircraft.  SANR will enhance and further enable the ability of the maneuver commander to integrate and synchronize aviation forces with land based operational forces. SANR, employed on Army aviation platforms, will enable aviation combat elements (Combat Aviation Brigades, Theater Aviation Brigades, and Special Operations Aviation Regiment) to better utilize the inherent versatility of airborne communications as a complement to the unique capabilities of the other combat arms.  SANR will give commanders enhanced Situational Awareness and Mission Command in a package that provides a more responsive means of directing aircraft to match changing maneuver forces situations and missions.

FY 2019 RDTE funding allocated to SANR supports planned program activities, such as, source selection testing and acquisition activities in support of contract award and continued development of documentation to support Milestone C.  As part of the CSA Network Review, the Network Cross Functional Team (CFT) is reviewing the current network portfolio, to include review of the SANR program path and Capability Production Document.  The SANR Program path forward is expected to evolve based on outcomes of the CSA Network Review and Network CFT efforts, as part of a modernized Army network.

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>SANR OPA funding, not reflected in this form, includes $9.878 million in FY 2020, $67.043 million in FY 2021, $141.233 million in FY 2022, and $168.629 million in FY 2023.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SANR acquisition strategy is to procure small airborne networking radios for the Apache, Blackhawk, Chinook, and Gray Eagle aircraft. SANR will be capable of operating advanced networking and SINCGARS waveforms.  SANR will replace Army Aviation platform SINCGARS ARC-201D radios.  The SANR acquisition strategy employs full and open competition using an NDI procurement approach that leverages prior industry and Government investment in software-defined radios. The strategy supports a concept in which NDI radios can be selected from a qualified vendor that meet the AMF SANR CPD requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) program is a designated Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).

The AIAMD program is a direct response to the U.S. Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Concept and Operational and Organizational (O&amp;O) Plan for the Future Force, the AIAMD System of Systems (SoS) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and the Air and Missile Defense Task Force Concept of Operations (CONOPS).   The AIAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching SoS capability with all participating Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing (1) the IAMD Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that provides the common Mission Command capability, (2) the Integrated Fire Control Relay capability for fire control connectivity and distributed operations, and (3) the common Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) Kits that network enable multiple sensor components, weapon components, and the IBCS EOC.

The AIAMD Program will provide advanced capabilities to the Army and the soldier by allowing transformation to a network-centric system-of-systems capability (also referred to as "Plug and Fight") that integrates AMD sensors and weapons with the IBCS EOC.  The AIAMD SoS architecture will enable extended range and non-line-of-sight engagements, to include joint kill chain engagements across the full spectrum of aerial threats, providing fire control quality data to the most appropriate weapon to complete the mission successfully.  Further, it will mitigate the coverage gaps and the single points of failure that have plagued AMD defense design in the past.  The AIAMD program will provide the user with the ability to train on a single Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System that will result in overall training savings.  The AIAMD program will also provide the Army with the ability to procure components that will build to established Integrated Fire Control interfaces alleviating the cost of procuring total system capabilities in the future. 

Funding in FY 2019 will provide for continuation of software development and developmental test phase activities, to include preparation and conduct of developmental flight test. 

Fielding of the IBCS is the Army Air Defense Artillery User's number one priority.  The AIAMD Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be delivered through fielding of the IBCS EOC-based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS EOC, Sentinel, and Patriot components connected via an IFCN, working in an integrated manner.  Additional capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade Headquarters, Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Headquarters, and Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC).  Future additional capabilities include incorporation of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) batteries into the AIAMD architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This program is an integral part of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) architecture. It provides for development of a common Integrated Fire Control System through an open architecture approach allowing for integration of Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components as they become available. This approach enables the AIAMD program to pursue its baseline program independent of fluctuation of other programs.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AIAMD acquisition strategy is to deliver an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY22. The capabilities are delivered through the fielding of the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC)-based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS EOC, Sentinel, and Patriot (through a Radar Interface Unit (RIU)) components connected via an Integrated Fire Control Relay, working in an integrated manner. Additional capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade Headquarters, Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Headquarters, and Indirect Fire Protection Capabilities (IFPC). Future additional capabilities include incorporation of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries and other Army and Joint net-centric architectures to ensure compatibility.

Key principles of the AIAMD acquisition approach are the following:
-  Migrate from system-based acquisition to component-based acquisition
-  Use system-of-systems acquisition approach with collaboration among AIAMD, PEO MS, PEO C3T, and Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization Component Project Offices, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other Service Project Offices to network enable weapons and sensor components
-  Develop and procure common Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that replaces seven weapon system unique Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) components
-  Establish product lines used to evaluate and select, modify and integrate modular open systems hardware (HW) and software (SW) common configuration items
-  Conduct architecture-based System Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&amp;T) activities for an incremental fielded configuration of the AIAMD Integrated Fire Control (IFC) Network-compatible IBCS EOC, weapons and sensor system components</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 'National Integration To Tactical Systems (Military Intelligence Program - MIP)' funds provide for transition and integration of National Intelligence Community (IC) advanced technologies and prototypes leveraged by the Army's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program office.  The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy with Army investments. Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  Army TENCAP facilitates the continued access to National Intel Community (IC) 'joint' efforts and compatibility with those National standards and software baseline for those Army PORs that benefit from these leveraged National IC technologies, resulting in cost-savings through cost-sharing, and Army participation in collaborative Intelligence. Funds will be used for final-stage integration efforts identified and vetted through the Army TENCAP annual TGOSG, such as: advanced Air Vigilance software enhancements; POR sensor integration into the Theater Net-Centric Geolocation network; integration of the future Advanced Miniaturized Data Acquisition System (AMDAS - Next) capability into PM DCGS-A family of systems and operational concepts;  transition and integration of Army TENCAP technologies discovered and leveraged by the annual Military Exploitation of Reconnaissance and Intelligent Technology (MERIT) project selection process, as well as other transitioning technologies discovered and/or leverage through other joint TENCAP outreach efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Vigilance (AV) is an ACAT III Automated Information System (AIS) program of record (POR) that originated from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developed and fielded cooperatively with the Intelligence Community (IC) through the efforts and mission of the Army's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) office.  The QRC was transitioned into an Army AIS POR by the AAE in May 2013 and assigned to Army Program Executive Office - Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEWS), the chartered acquisition authority for management and execution of the Army's TENCAP mission and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for the AV POR.  The Army TENCAP continues to leverage the IC common software development and support contract to field the AV systems, and ensure this primarily software based system can continue to access and leverage the common software, and input or ingest the latest sensor collects into the common IC data library.  As an AIS POR, the AV POR is currently fielding systems per its Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) and with software and system capabilities that meet its latest validated Capability Drop (CD) requirements.  The AV POR is currently scheduled to meet Full Deployment (FD) by 2021, and will continue to evolve to meet future validated Capability Drop requirements and maintain its effectiveness against emerging threats.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding supports the development and testing of the JLTV Family of Vehicles (FoV).  JLTV is a joint program between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, of which the U.S. Army is the lead service.  The JLTV goal is a FoV capable of performing multiple mission roles designed to provide protected, sustained, and networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO).  JLTV objectives include increased performance, protection, and payload over the current legacy HMMWV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and reliability.  The commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized. 

Major FY19 budget activities include test asset disposal, PM support, and Science and Technology funding to explore and develop integration solutions for Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) on the JLTV platform, along with operational efficiency solutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JLTV is a joint program between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, of which the U.S. Army is the lead service.  The JLTV goal is a FoV capable of performing multiple mission roles designed to provide protected, sustained, and networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO).  JLTV objectives include increased performance, protection, and payload over the current legacy HMMWV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and reliability.  The commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized. 

Major FY19 budget activities include test asset disposal, PM support, and Science and Technology funding to explore and develop integration solutions for Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) on the JLTV platform, along with operational efficiency solutions.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) is a Joint Service Program with the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps as the two main components.  The U.S. Army is the JLTV service lead.

The JLTV Program entered the Production and Deployment Phase with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorization on 25 August 2015.  With Milestone C approval, the LRIP fixed price contract was awarded to Oshkosh Defense LLC on 25 August 2015.  This contract consists of a three year LRIP period with options for five additional years of FRP deliveries.  JPO JLTV requested separately priced firm fixed price (FFP) option(s) for purchase of the Technical Data Package (TDP) with appropriate data rights to allow for possible future competition for production vehicles and spares. 

During the LRIP phase, JPO JLTV will continue to produce production vehicles for extensive Test and Evaluation activities to support a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision.  A ramp up of JLTV quantities will continue thru FY19 to support fielding to U.S. Army and USMC units once the FRP decision is achieved and allow the program to transition into FRP.

The JLTV program will continually monitor emerging technologies and capabilities through its partnerships with U.S. Army and Marine Corps science and technology organizations as well as through industry market research and partnerships.  At this time follow-on increments for technology insertion are undefined; the JLTV program will look for opportunities to implement increased capabilities throughout the systems Life Cycle.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) is an ACAT 1C Acquisition Program. The program will replace the current fleet of M109 Family of Vehicles (FoV) consisting of the M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzer and M992A2 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV). PIM is an Army Modernization Program that addresses a critical capability gap created by the Non-Line of Sight Cannon termination in June of 2009 as well as obsolescence and Space, Weight,and Power (SWAP) issues in the M109 FoV current fleet. The PIM system integrates current Bradley Fighting Vehicle suspension and drive train items, Future Combat Systems (FCS) developed Electric Gun Drive systems and current fleet (M109A6) fire control systems into a new chassis providing better force protection, survivability and increases in electrical power over the current fleet. PIM is a two vehicle system:  The M109A7 Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and the M992A3 Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT).  The SPH has all characteristics listed above.  The CAT utilizes all of these same components and traits except those related directly to the cannon system. The PIM system replaces the current M109 FoV on a one for one basis, in the cannon fires battalions in the Armored Brigade Combat Team Formations and the Echelons above Brigade (EAB). The overall intent is to increase Soldier force protection, vehicle survivability, provide an appropriate amount of SWAP capacity to add future capabilities, increase vehicle reliability, reduce life cycle costs and extend the life of the M109 FoV through FY 2050.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Funding provides contractor support for the execution of the final Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing for the M109A7 Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and the M992A3 Carrier Ammunition, Tracked (CAT).   These tests include Production Qualification Test (PQT), Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E), Full Up System Live Fire (FUSL), and Under Belly Armor characterization testing.  The reduced funding level from FY 16 to FY 17 reflects the culmination of the test events and writing of the test reports, addressing any issues discovered during test and the shift of the actual IOT&amp;E test event into the 1st QTR FY17.  These events will be conducted at various test sites throughout the US including Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG), Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), and the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC).  Software Phase III maintenance and Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) development will also be conducted this year.  New Equipment Training (NET) Programs of Instruction (POI) development and execution to support IOT&amp;E will be accomplished this year.  All of the listed events are required to complete the various documentation requirements and test reports that will determine the operational suitability of the system and support the Full Rate Production decision in 4th QTR FY 2018.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The PIM Program was initiated on 16 August 2007 under the BAE Systems, Inc., System Technical Support (STS) Contract W56HZV-07-C-0096.  Subsequent work directives were awarded under BAE STS contract W56HZV-07-C-0256 to further define the configuration of the PIM vehicles.  On 14 August 2009, a Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Contract W56HZV-09-C-0550 was awarded to BAE Systems Inc. for the Prototype Development and Fabrication of 7 prototype vehicles (5 PIM Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) Systems and 2 PIM Carrier Ammunition, Tracked (CAT) vehicles).  A Comprehensive Contract Modification (CCM) award to the RDT&amp;E contract was accomplished on 6 January 2012.  This modification allows for the completion of the design engineering and initial developmental test portion of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and transfers the system responsibility for the program from the Government to BAE Systems Inc.   An additional modification to the EMD contract was awarded on 18 July 2014 to extend the contract until 31 March 2017 to cover contractor support to Production Qualification Testing (PQT), the Logistics Demonstration, and Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).  The awarded Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract is of a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contract type for procurement of vehicles with a period of performance running from November 2013 through approximately June 2019.  The LRIP contract will provide for three LRIP years with the initial base year including 19 SPHs and 18 CATs and the remaining three option years with 18 sets, 30 sets and 48 sets, respectively (each set consisting of one each SPH and CAT) of PIM vehicles.  The Full Rate Production (FRP) contract is planned as a FPIF contract with the option to convert to a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract after the first year of FRP.  The FRP contract provides for the remaining PIM vehicles to fulfill the requirement up to the Army Acquisition Objective of 580 sets.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project is a Military Intelligence Program (MIP). TROJAN research and development supports TROJAN Next Generation (TROJAN NexGEN), formerly TROJAN Classic XXI (TCXXI), future capabilities to fulfill the Army's need for worldwide, deployable, remotable, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support that can dynamically execute operations from sanctuary-based to deployed assets in theater. In support of Army Modernization and Army Force Generation, TROJAN NexGEN will provide soldiers with a real-world, hands-on, live and near-real time Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) training environment sustaining, maintaining and enhancing their military occupational specialty proficiencies and specific target expertise. This operational readiness training will fulfill the Army's larger intelligence training requirement via a secure, collaborative architecture. 

A key factor for future force success is the ability to collect, process, and use information about an adversary while preventing similar information from being disclosed. TROJAN NexGEN is a combined operational and readiness mission system which uses advanced networking technology to provide seamless rapid radio relay, secure communications to include voice, data, and electronic reconnaissance support to U.S. forces throughout the world. TROJAN NexGEN operations may be easily tailored to fit military intelligence unit training schedules and surged during specific events to involve every aspect of the tactical intelligence collection, processing, analysis and reporting systems. Engineers test and evaluate new digital intelligence collection, processing and dissemination technology using the fielded TROJAN NexGEN systems prior to the acquisition of those technologies. As part of the objective intelligence architecture, these capabilities will enable processing and dissemination of real-time intelligence data from various sources to form the intelligence needed to issue orders inside the threat decision cycle. To that end, it is imperative that TROJAN NexGEN keeps pace with digitization initiatives in order to respond aggressively to the emerging intelligence communication threat.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is a Military Intelligence Program (MIP). TROJAN research and development supports TROJAN Next Generation (TROJAN NexGEN), formerly TROJAN Classic XXI (TCXXI), future capabilities to fulfill the Army's need for worldwide, deployable, remotable, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support that can dynamically execute operations from sanctuary-based to deployed assets in theater. In support of Army Modernization and Army Force Generation, TROJAN NexGEN will provide soldiers with a real-world, hands-on, live and near-real time SIGINT training environment sustaining, maintaining and enhancing their military occupational specialty proficiencies and specific target expertise. This operational readiness training will fulfill the Army's larger intelligence training requirement via a secure, collaborative architecture. 

A key factor for future force success is the ability to collect, process, and use information about an adversary while preventing similar information from being disclosed. TROJAN NexGEN is a combined operational and readiness mission system which uses advanced networking technology to provide seamless rapid radio relay, secure communications to include voice, data, and electronic reconnaissance support to U.S. forces throughout the world. TROJAN NexGEN operations may be easily tailored to fit military intelligence unit training schedules and surged during specific events to involve every aspect of the tactical intelligence collection, processing, analysis and reporting systems. Engineers test and evaluate new digital intelligence collection, processing and dissemination technology using the fielded TROJAN NexGEN systems prior to the acquisition of those technologies. As part of the objective intelligence architecture, these capabilities will enable processing and dissemination of real-time intelligence data from various sources to form the intelligence needed to issue orders inside the threat decision cycle. To that end, it is imperative that TROJAN NexGEN keeps pace with digitization initiatives in order to respond aggressively to the emerging intelligence communication threat.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for tactical Electronic Warfare (EW).  EW encompasses the development of tactical EW equipment and systems mounted in both ground and air vehicles.  The systems under this program provides the Army with the capability to degrade or deny hostile forces the effective use of their communications, counter mortar/counterbattery radars, surveillance radars, infrared/optical battlefield surveillance systems and electronically fused munitions.  Existing Army EW systems must be replaced or upgraded to maintain their capability in the face of threats. Prophet Enhanced is the current system under the Prophet Ground acquisition program.  Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces.  Prophet Enhanced provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack). The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) is a Department of the Army established project to develop techniques, methods, tools and architecture to reprogram mission software embedded in Army EW systems, Force Protection Systems (FPS), and Target Sensing Systems (TSS) in response to changes in threat signatures.  ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within intelligence systems, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop EW Mission Software and Products (MSP) for both air and ground EW systems, 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MSPs, 4) improved communications conduits to transmit mission software changes to field users, and 5) enhanced mission-software uploading tools. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, simulation, mission software development, distribution and uploading of mission software changes directly to the supported Soldier in the field.  The ARAT project will develop, test and equip an Army-wide infrastructure capable of rapidly reprogramming electronic combat software embedded in offensive and defensive weapon system.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget request funds Electronic Warfare (EW) Development for Prophet Enhanced efforts (Project EW5) and The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) efforts (Project EW6).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) is a Department of the Army established program to develop techniques, methods, tools and architecture to rapidly reprogram mission software embedded in Army Electronic Warfare (EW) systems in response to changes in threat signatures. The regulatory guidance directing this mission is contained in Army Regulation (AR) 525-15, AR 525-22, and AR 95-1. The ARAT develops integrated technical solutions required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW threats to US Forces. The ARAT reprogramming infrastructure supports the Army Campaign Plan to provide the Regionally Aligned Forces tactical Commander timely rapid-reprogramming capability of EW systems with mission software.  The ARAT mission responsibility is to develop and distribute Mission Software and Products to forward deployed combat forces. ARAT identifies and analyzes threat signature changes which affect EW systems; determine the impact of observed signature changes; rapidly develop new mission software to adapt friendly systems to detect and defeat enemy threats to U.S. Army ground and air platforms; disseminate the Mission Software and Products to forward deployed forces, and provide government developed tools and software to upload new mission software into the affected EW systems.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Current military operations are conducted in a rapidly changing threat environment, where Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Infra Red (IR) man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) seekers, radar guided surface-to-air-missiles (SAM), laser guided weapons, anti-helicopter mines, and targeting sensors are proliferating and evolving. Integrated solutions are required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW threats.  The ARAT reprogramming infrastructure supports the tactical Commander by providing timely rapid reprogramming of mission software and information dissemination for Army supported, Joint and allied services.  ARAT supports integrated reprogramming of target acquisition, target engagement, vehicle survivability, and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE). ARAT rapid-reprogramming infrastructure supports tactical requirements for deployed aircraft and ground-based (e.g. Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (CREW)) survivability systems. ARAT identifies and analyzes threat signature changes which affect EW systems; determines the impact of observed signature changes; develops new mission software to adapt the system to the changes; disseminates the mission software; and provides methods to upload the new mission software into the affected EW systems. Each element within the ARAT infrastructure plays a specific role within the program's rapid reprogramming process, providing the Soldier with the capability to install mission and target identification software at the lowest possible level, thus maximizing flexibility for tactical commanders. ARAT participates in the operational and developmental test design of Army EW systems, and supports Joint Service Reprogramming Exercises in all theaters. ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within the intelligence system, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop Mission Software and Products (MSP), 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MSPs, 4) improved communications conduits to rapidly transmit mission software to upload into supported EW systems. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, threat modeling and simulation, mission software development and testing, distribution and uploading of mission software directly to the supported Soldier in the field.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

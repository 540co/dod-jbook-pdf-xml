                                        <r2:Text>MOCAS
MOCAS is a hardware &amp; software computing platform used by DCMA &amp; DFAS to administer and pay contracts issued to Defense contractors. As an integrated contract administration and payment system, MOCAS is designed to provide DCMA and DFAS with the electronic information necessary to accomplish their mission of contract and payment administration. In order to implement the MOCAS technical architecture  modernization, DCMA will procure the necessary servers, storage, software, networking, and hardware.

In FY 2016 a Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) was established between the DCMA and DFAS to drive efficiencies in how these Agencies manage the MOCAS system. As a result of these efficiencies, the JPMO was able for the first time to schedule/work the design of several complex MOCAS System Change Requests (SCRs) in parallel to address multiple DoD initiatives:  Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) compliance; Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) compliance; enterprise implementation/integration of the Procurement Data Standard (PDS); improved automated/electronic Contract Orders and Modifications (EDI 850/860); and improved Treasury reporting/disbursement processing.  These efforts increased the interoperability of contract administration and contract pay activities data across the DoD enterprise, significantly reducing costs related to the Department's Procure-2-Pay mission.

IWMS
Integrated Workflow Management System (IWMS) deployed a new capability to safeguard documents from destruction by systematically placing them in a legal hold status within an electronic document and records management system (eDRMS).  This capability will enable DCMA to automatically purge contract documents that have exceeded their retention periods in the Agency’s National Archives &amp; Records Administration (NARA)- approved file plan, thus maintaining system performance and reducing future document storage costs. In FY 2016 the DCMA developed automated contract review, contract termination, and semi-automated contract data integrity screening capabilities, which will reduce backlog in the contract close out process.

TMS
In FY 2016, the DCMA Talent Management System completed development on Increment 1.1 and 2a.  Increment 1.1 provided additional capabilities on training management and 2a provided DCMA with the capabilities of Quota Management for courses and classes by fiscal year which improved planning and forecasting.  Increment 2a deployment also provided feedback surveys creation, management, and survey taking.  This capability assisted in better decision making for the Agency. Redesigned TMS to be a self-contained system, which allows the back end of TMS to be less intertwined with the DCMA database and allows for more streamlined, simplified data integration.  TMS also deployed a new developer administration tool which provides additional capabilities for developers to support the system without deploying new code. Increment 2a was fully tested and achieved operational readiness in late FY 2016.

EVAS (Earned Value Analysis System)
In partnership with industry, the DCMA hosted the Earned Value Analysis (EVA) Data Pilot effort which completed the baseline of standardizing Earned Value Metrics (EV math) ensuring consistent application across all DoD contracts with Earned Value requirements.   The intent of the Pilot effort is to develop a standard, transparent approach to automate test metrics and protocols, using data generated by the contractor EVAS and integrated sub-systems.   Automation of these metrics is required to facilitate a risk-based surveillance approach allowing movement from a calendar driven “one size fits all” approach to one that is focused on system health based upon results of data and trend analysis.    

Based on these metrics and protocols the DCMA developed/authored software requirements necessary to procure/award a COTS software solution which will be the engine that powers EVAS.  EVAS COTS software completed the rigorous IT security accreditation process which met and/or exceeded all DoD and DCMA security requirements receiving full authority to operate approval on DCMA’s information system network.

Asset and Service Management
The DCMA modernized its IT Asset and Service Management capabilities to fall in line with recent NDAA software asset and assurance changes.  In addition, this effort began to align DCMA’s Information Technology processes with systems that can execute Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices.  This included the development of configuration management capabilities which increased DCMA’s cyber security posture.

Supply Chain Risk Assessment System
DCMA made additional modifications to provide industrial base analysis capability to DCMA and DoD.

Modifications &amp; Delivery Orders
Modifications and Delivery Orders (MDO) modernization development and capability releases supported several critical DoD initiatives and Federal Acquisition Regulation/Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR/DFAR) changes, including the implementation of Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID).  The system modifications further addressed needs and requirements, such as improved efficiency in mass modification and related contract action reports functionality, to problems that slowed down or hindered optimal performance-based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components.  

Other Programs
DCMA’s other programs supports Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) modifications for industry and mainly the infrastructure backbone that supports all of DCMA's web based capabilities.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>MOCAS
In FY17 the Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) will focus on the conceptual design of a modernized MOCAS Technical Architecture to further drive efficiencies in how the Agencies perform their Contract Administration and Contract Pay missions. The current MOCAS technical environment aligns with 1960s techniques and is limiting our development choices while stifling innovation. While some of the underlying MOCAS system technology has been upgraded (most recently in the 1980s), the fundamental architecture has not been updated. The approach for performing architecture and technology upgrades for the MOCAS system is complicated and will require multiple initiatives (Business Process Reengineering (BPR), Organizational Change Management (OCM) , prototyping and technical evaluations) working together to maintain business functionality as we enhance the system. These initiatives include upgrading the user interface to a modern interactive web experience, establishing configurable workflows and business rules in the system, updating the persistent data storage technologies in use, and augmenting the reporting and system interfaces to enhance interoperability within the DoD. Additionally and in parallel, the MOCAS JPMO will move from design to development on three major/complex System Change Requests (SCRs), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 850/860 recycle, Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID), and Single Line of Accounting (SLOA) with projected implementation late FY 2017/ mid FY 2018 and late FY 2018 respectively. The need for these system changes is driven not only by our internal stakeholders and customers, but also by directives and policies received from various regulatory sources such as the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO); Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L); Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP); and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)/FAR. Appropriate investment is required to implement these changes that will help the DoD move closer to achieving key goals for improving financial controls and audit trails that promote end-to-end funds traceability, compliance with data standards, and adoption of modern technologies to improve interoperability across the DoDs Procure-to Pay mission.

IWMS
Phase 2 and 3 to develop and deploy automated and semi-automated enterprise-wide contract close-out and process review capabilities though out DCMA.

TMS
In FY 2017, TMS Increment 2B will be deployed to 12,000 plus DCMA users and begin development of Increment 3. DCMA is currently finalizing Increment 2B development and beginning testing of the system. This Increment addresses needed production updates, simplifies workflows, develops Tag libraries to reduce html clutter, and provides vendor management and travel management capabilities. TMS will be intergraded with the Acquisition Workforce Qualification Initiative (AWQI) with the expected value for DCMA; Acquisition focused on-the-job development for individuals’ needs and the ability to view skill gaps at an organization level to allow for development of mitigation plans for systemic gaps.  AWQI will provide DCMA’s employees with the competency standard needed for each Job position.  This will be the beginning of DCMA’s competency assessments of its workforce.  Increment 2B is scheduled to deploy the middle of 2017. DCMA IT will also position TMS in a stand-alone infrastructure that will better support DCMA’s 12000 plus employees to improve accessibility and performance for DCMA’s training system.

EVAS
EVAS will continue its partnership with industry to maintain standardize EV metrics and protocols.  EVAS plans to execute a COTS software configuration and deployment utilizing baseline EV metrics while performing and completing Increments 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4 of configuration and testing. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is scheduled for fourth quarter FY 2017.  IOC consists of the COTS software solution fully configured, tested, and deployed on a DCMA EV Data Analysis laptop with EV automated metrics and protocols available to DCMA EVM specialists.  EVAS also plans to begin the second phase of the EVAS solution specifically the build out of the network infrastructure necessary to support the centralization of EV software and all supplier provided EV cost &amp; schedule data.   Centralization is necessary in order to deploy the EV Common Operation Picture allowing for automated real-time visibility across all EV programs, suppliers, and contracts.

Asset and Service Management
The DCMA will continue to modernize its IT Asset and Service Management capabilities to fall in line with the NDAA software asset and assurance mandates. In addition, the effort continues to align DCMA’s Information Technology processes with systems that can execute Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices. 

Supply Chain risk Assessment System
DCMA is developing capabilities to redeploy the Contract Business Analysis Repository (CBAR) program with upgrades under the Supply Chain Risk Assessment System

Modifications &amp; Delivery Orders (MDO)
MDO modernization efforts will continue to improve mass modification further reducing manual contract intervention.  The system will also provide the capability to pull pertinent data directly from an Electronic Document Access (EDA) interface, edit additional data fields, cancel and recall actions, and perform additional data validations. Furthermore, DCMA is currently migrating MDO modernization development from a waterfall to agile incremental approach to align with DCMA's system development approach which consistently enables the deployment of needed capability in a faster and more efficient manner, resulting in overall Contract Administration Services (CAS) cost savings.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCMA is invigorating efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  In pursuing these business practices, we are continuing to utilize both government full time equivalents and contractors to perform specialized functions such as software development, testing, and process automation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>To deliver on our mission and vision, the Agency is focused on four primary goals:  1) inform and contribute to cost control and affordability decisions; 2) develop agile business practices which optimize mission execution and support to the acquisition enterprise; 3) create and maintain an agile learning organization and culture that strives to exceed customer expectations; and 4) expect of ourselves what we expect of our contractors:  good fiscal stewardship.  All four of the strategic goals go directly to the heart of the DCMA mission.  The Agency helps our partners spend their finite dollars wisely, ultimately ensuring the front line Warfighters get the equipment and services they need when they need them.  Adherence to executing and ultimately attaining these goals will posture DCMA to positively support current and future BBP initiatives, QDR priorities, SECDEF’s six focus areas, and the PMA including initiatives in services acquisition, innovative science and technology, and efforts to ensure greater acquisition affordability and better cost control throughout the acquisition life cycle.  Agency focus will not solely rest on qualitative contract administration functions, but will also focus on quantitative factors as well – those factors that will clearly emphasize the Agency’s return on investment (ROI) to the Department and to our other customers and the taxpayers at large.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

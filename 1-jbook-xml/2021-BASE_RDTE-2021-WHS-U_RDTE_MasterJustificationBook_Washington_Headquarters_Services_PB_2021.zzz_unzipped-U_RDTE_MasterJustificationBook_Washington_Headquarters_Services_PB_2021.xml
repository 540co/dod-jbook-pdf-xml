The DIU increases the Department's access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector.  Working across the country, and in collaboration with the military departments and international partners, the DIU is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include "non-traditional" companies that had previously not collaborated with the military, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their knowledge and expertise in support of our nation's defense.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The FY 2019 request funded the development of leading-edge technologies emerging from high-tech companies that are not traditional defense contractors.  An objective of this program is to obtain innovative technological advancements developed in the commercial sector and integrate into the DoD technological ecosystem.

In FY 2019, the DIU scaled commercial solutions essential to military-technical advantage across the joint force.  Through predictive maintenance, DIU improved mission readiness by partnering with the Air Force to prototype predictive maintenance technology for the E-3 Sentry and C-5 Galaxy aircraft.  The prototype reduced unscheduled maintenance by 20-40% and increased readiness by 3-6%. This prototype is being scaled across the Air Force's 5,400 military aircraft and to the Army's Apache and Blackhawk helicopters. 

The DIU also executed agile software development through Kessel Run, and saved taxpayer dollars by taking the Tanker Planning Tool from a white board to a digital application within four months at an initial cost of $1.5 million. The tool has saved more than $300 million and has scaled to a 300 person Air Force software development organization.  Finally, DIU increased the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) by receiving solution briefs from more than 1,200 companies based in 43 states and the District of Columbia.  DIU is working with 122 non-traditional defense contractors, 66 of which are first-time DoD vendors.</r2:Description>

DIU's objective is to rapidly solve the problems of our DoD customers and deploy those solutions. Accordingly, DIU requirements are driven by DoD customers in the Services, Defense Agencies, and Combatant Commands. DoD customers come to DIU with their most challenging and most compelling technological problems.  DIU works to solve the challenges and issues for the Department in areas such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Autonomy, Human Systems, Information Technology, and Space.</r2:Text>

The DDS serves as an organization composed of commercially experienced software developers, software designers, product managers, and problem solvers within DoD and utilizes best-in-class private sector practices, talent, and technology to transform the way digital services are delivered within the Department.  

The DDS uses design and technology to improve government services, strengthen national defense, and care for military members and their families.  For FY 2021 DDS will expand on previous technology efforts, leverage public and private sector initiatives, and pursue innovative solutions to transform technology and improve and expand modern digital services and capabilities across the Department.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Over the past four years, DDS has provided services and tools that have improved and saved the lives of Service members and their families, and provided technological superiority in areas critical to national defense.  Key initiatives include: reforming digital services that provide military families critical health benefits; launching the Federal Government's first bug bounty program 'Hack the Pentagon'; building the next-generation Global Positioning System; developing drone detection technologies; hunting adversaries on DoD networks; overhauling the logistics system that helps military families move; and redesigning training for cyber soldiers.</r2:Description>

With a team firmly rooted in the heart of the Pentagon, Defense Digital Service (DDS) serves as a nimble unit with the ability to quickly mobilize and tackle some the DoDs toughest technological challenges.  DDS's approach leverages industry best practices to efficiently navigate policy, contracts, and tech blockers to reach working and scalable solutions to hardware and software problems.  The ultimate goal of the team is to support DoD in finding and implementing relevant tech solutions to hard and/or impossible problems that when solved, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the department in carrying out its mission to defend the United States and its domestic and overseas interests.  Ultimately, the purpose and goal of the team is to ensure that solutions reach the hands of end users, including warfighters, in short timelines, so that compound problems from the existing problem sets do not persist.</r2:Text>

DDS projects are positioned to complement and support the Department's innovation and modernization priorities and will continue to support data science, cyber security, and stronger technology platforms across the DoD.  Criteria for project selection include the potential for impact, sustainability, and long-term ownership within the Department.  Some current efforts include expanding the DDS "Jyn" program that pairs cyber soldiers and other military tech talent with DoD experts on special projects; launching a pilot to help modernize and automate portions of the security clearance process; building out a new satellite office in Augusta, Georgia; and continuing to advise on the JEDI cloud procurement.

DDS will continue to support the Secretary of Defense in his focus on IT modernization, supporting military personnel, and overall vision for the DoD.</r2:Text>

                                                            <r2:Text>DDS research and development is one of the Secretary of Defense's top priorities with the intent of advancing and modernizing technology, especially software systems, critical to the successful implementation of a variety of Department and war fighter missions.  DDS requirements are driven by challenging technical problems identified by the Secretary of Defense where technology is failing the Department's mission and could impede the lethality and effectiveness of the war fighter.  These technical problems vary in scope and complexity, but at a minimum, when resolved, have a positive impact on the war fighter's mission and capabilities.  DDS involvement may be in the development of new code, product management, advising on code development processes and releases, and hacking or re-writing existing policies or processes that are antiquated or otherwise unnecessary.  DDS engages on highly troubled projects to quickly implement fixes that ultimately reduce schedule slip, increase security, lower costs, improve user experiences, and accelerate performance.    

The most pressing project in which DDS is engaged involves the vetting and security clearance process for personnel.  DDS has partnered with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency to build a prototype to improve the personnel vetting and security clearance process.  With the transfer of the background investigation mission from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to the DoD, DDS is exploring ways to deliver more accurate vetting results while eliminating the existing backlog of cases. The DDS-led System for Automated Background Evaluation and Review (SABER) prototype effort will focus on delivery of an automated investigation result, beginning with the user applying for a clearance, processing the data through government and commercial databases, recording an adjudication decision, and enrolling in continuous evaluation.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds missile defense systems integration efforts for both the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT).

USASMDC/ARSTRAT:  Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for space and ground-based midcourse defense (GMD), the Army integrator for global missile defense, and the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) of the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).  Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense and Space/High Altitude capabilities.  As the Army proponent for space, high altitude and GMD, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to realize the GMD capabilities.  As the Army integrator for global missile defense, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible for reviewing programs managed by the Army, other Services, Defense agencies and National agencies to ensure that they are correctly synchronized and will ultimately provide the capabilities required by USSTRATCOM to execute its global missile defense responsibilities. 

Project TR5 funds United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/ Army Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop the associated operational prototyping, experimentation, operational analysis, and modeling and simulation in support of current and future Forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Four major efforts will be performed with these funds.    a) High Power Microwave Lethality Prototype testing, testing and modeling will be performed to ascertain the vulnerabilities of critical electrical circuits and components in order to attack adversary systems, such as unmanned aerial systems, and to protect U.S. assets and infrastructure in use by the Warfighter.  b)  Advanced Electronic/Environmental Control Unit Thermal Management Prototypes of different sizes will be built and tested to reduce the magnitude of fuel used at forward operating bases consumed by environmental control units to keep major electronic systems cool in austere environments.  Prototypes will be used to fully evaluate distributed cooling and legacy approaches.  c) Technology Complex Compound Materials for Thermal/Energy Management prototypes will be manufactured and test for suitability in high velocity impacts.  The planned compound is Coordinative Molecular Bond Armor Material  and has potential to provide ballistics and thermal protection.   d) Upgrades are planned for the Advanced Measurement Optical Range facility to support laser radar development and testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In order to bring those capabilities into the force development of new force design updates (FDUs) for FDU cycles 16-1, 16-2, 17-1 will be required.  Additionally during the TAA cycle new Rules of Allocation (ROA) will be developed to ensure missile defense units are properly accounted for in the future. Take the lessons learned from the FY16 efforts to continue to evaluate new technologies in realistic operating environments.  This will be accomplished by supporting ongoing efforts that provide the most realistic operating environment available to perform technology gap and cost reduction analysis of space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  Realistic operating environments will be available to determine the ability of the specific technologies to fill capability gaps in terms of utility to the warfighter.  Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools/Test Beds for evolving space superiority, high altitude and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance missile defense capabilities. The Future War Center (FWC) will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) delivering the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis, operational planning, and exercise/ experimentation support.  The FWC will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Reconfigurable Tactical Operations Simulator (RTOS) delivering operator in the loop capability for air and missile defense simulation in distributed exercises and experiments.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Support Total Army Analysis (TAA) 20-24 Resourcing Phase. TAA is a phased force structure analysis process that defines the required Army force structure within end strength and accounts for the military and DA Civilian requirements and authorizations necessary to comply with DOD guidance. The TAA provides the basis for the Army?s Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development and establishment of the POM Force.  Resourcing and Approval, the determination must be made as to the level of acceptable risk to be taken for each capability. These capability demands are based on Army leadership directives, written guidance, risk analysis, the Army force generation approach and input from the Combatant Commander?s Daily Operational Requirements (CCDOR). TAA builds a POM Force with which the PEGs can develop their portion of the Army?s budget. The POM Force will also determine the OF enabler support force structure and define the Generating Force (GF) necessary to support and sustain the OF capabilities directed in strategic guidance. The determination of the composition of the Army force structure, or shape, is an iterative, risk-benefit, trade-off analysis process. Capability Demand Analysis is made up of two separate events: force guidance and quantitative analysis.

Participate in the Army's FDU process The FDU Includes capabilities development, capabilities determination, requirements approval, and implementation decisions.  Develops organizational design solutions to overcome identified capability shortfalls that cannot be accommodated by doctrine, training, leadership and education, facility, or policy solutions. As part of the solution development, TRADOC CoEs force modernization proponents and non-TRADOC force management proponents consider courses of action across DOTMLPF-P with the intent of deriving materiel, personnel and organizational solutions as a last resort. Once an organizational solution becomes the recommendation, the force modernization proponent begins the integration process across the DOTMLPF-P domains.

Take the lessons learned from the FY 2017 efforts to continue to evaluate new technologies in realistic operating environments.  This will be accomplished by supporting ongoing efforts that provide the most realistic operating environment available to perform technology gap and cost reduction analysis of space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  Realistic operating environments will be available to determine the ability of the specific technologies to fill capability gaps in terms of utility to the warfighter.  Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools/Test Beds for evolving space superiority, high altitude and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance missile defense capabilities. The Future War Center (FWC) will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) delivering the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis, operational planning, and exercise/ experimentation support.  The FWC will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Reconfigurable Tactical Operations Simulator (RTOS) delivering operator in the loop capability for air and missile defense simulation in distributed exercises and experiments."</r2:Text>

This is necessary to ensure that space, high altitude and cyber capability gaps are identified and capabilities are correctly represented so that the Army's use of these capabilities is explored and where possible, exploited.  Will develop and maintain One Semi-Automated Force (OneSAF) simulation space updates and provide to PEO STRI to be included in OneSAF baseline.  Will develop space modernization strategies and sponsor exploration of future space and high altitude warfighting concepts.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT will continue efforts to enhance the resiliency and effectiveness of critical space-based assets and JCIDS capability development activities for space superiority, high altitude persistent platforms, nano-satellites and tactical launch systems. Products scheduled to be delivered in FY17 include Army Cyberspace Analysis; Space Superiority Analysis of Alternatives and Cost -Benefit Analysis updates: Overhead Persistence Infrared (OPIR) Analysis; Assessment of Hostile use of Space Force Enhancement; and Position Navigation Timing (PNT) analysis.  TAA 20-24 (APR 2016-MAR 2017) will introduce new space capabilities into the force.  In order to bring those capabilities into the force development of new force design updates (FDUs) for FDU cycles 16-1, 16-2, 17-1 will be required.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding in this program supports efforts to assess Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) performance and system vulnerabilities to threats from Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA).  Army AMD sensors, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Command and Control (C2), Radio Frequency (RF) data and voice networks will be assessed against current and postulated threat systems and techniques.  Potential solutions developed by the Army, other Services, and Defense agencies (for example Missile Defense Agency) to close identified gaps will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated CEMA environments.  Assessment events will be conducted approximately every two years. Analysis of results and implementation of potential solutions will occur between events using system-specific funding.  The proposed solutions will then be assessed at the next event after implementation. 

Included in this line are funds to plan and execute periodic CEMA activities with Army AMD systems, to include other Service and other Agency AMD systems as appropriate.  Upon completion of CEMA demonstration analyses, create concepts for mitigating Army AMD sensor, C2, and RF data link vulnerabilities.  Efforts in this program will also develop tools for use by Army AMD systems to improve overall system performance in contested environments, to include effects-based CEMA Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) to assess Army AMD CEMA concepts in Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) environment.  Collaboration is required with United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Joint Electromagnetic Preparedness for Advanced Combat (JEPAC) to evaluate, modify, and field existing Army AMD EP Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a Joint environment.  Additionally, there will be continual interface with intelligence communities to maintain cognizance of emerging CEMA threats and incorporate these threats in future CEMA demonstrations.  An output from these activities will be development of a time-phased roadmap that identifies the investments needed to improve the CEMA capabilities of Army AMD sensors, C2, and RF data and voice networks.

Funds in this line will also be used to transition the Army Low-Cost Portable Surveillance (ALPS) sensor from Science and Technology (S&amp;T) into an emerging Program of Record (PoR). Initially, prototype systems will be provided to meet Combatant Commands identified needs and to conduct an operational assessment. This program will also develop and integrate ALPS into the Army Integrated Air &amp; Missile Defense (AIAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) to improve the CEMA posture of the Army's AMD architecture. The objectives of this effort are to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent PoR integration risk.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Assessment events will be conducted approximately every two years in live and simulated CEMA environments.  In addition to government planning and conduct of assessments, funding will also be provided through various contracts for subject matter expertise. 

ALPS will utilize an existing Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Section 845 Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement to develop and integrate prototypes in the Army AMD architecture. An operational assessment will be used to refine ALPS requirements and assess the longer-term strategy.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides for the Concept Exploration and Refinement of Terrain Shaping Obstacles.  This PE develops alternatives to the Family of Scatterable Mines systems.

Project 606 enables component development of a new detection capability for explosive hazards, improvised explosive devices (IED), and components in support of route clearance operations.  These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.

Project EK7 Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for Terrain Shaping Obstacles.  The obstacles will deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battle space.  Area Denial Capability Development provides controlled scalable effects against mounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, delay or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to shape the battle space of an area without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement, and to actively detect and engage the enemy at all operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system, modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 606 Countermine/Barrier Advanced Development enables development and evaluation of technologies that will perform detection, neutralization, and clearing of landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) at operational speeds. 

The Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system is a suite of four capabilities for use by route clearance patrols to provide standoff detection of explosive hazards:  vehicle mounted anomaly detection; pinpoint explosive hazard detection; explosive hazard vapor and particle detection; and remote visualization.  FREHD increases the rate of advance of the route clearance formation while removing Soldiers and equipment from the proximity of blast and fragmentation.

The FY 2019 Base Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $2.968 million supports the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) delegation, the Materiel Development Decision (MDD), Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), and Milestone documentation in preparation for the initiation of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase for the Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Acquisition Strategy for Route Clearance Operations will be developed in conjunction with program initiation.  

The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) program is pursuing an acquisition approach that delivers capability to the Warfighter by leveraging the Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) currently deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR). In FY 2018, as part Engineering Development activities, the program will execute an ECP to add a wire detection capability to address evolving threat, and Infrared illumination to enable nighttime operation. A second ECP to improve operational availability of the HMDS during inclement weather and address obsolescence and Cyber Security deficiencies will follow. As part of the Advanced Development activities, the HMDS Program will conduct additional development and evaluation of technologies to address a broader spectrum of emerging threats, interoperability with electronic countermeasures, and detection and neutralization of landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) at operational speeds.

The Forward Reconnaissance Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) program will conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in FY 2019.  Results of the AoA will support the development of the acquisition strategy.  The requirement identifies four capabilities:  Forward Anomaly Detection, Pinpoint Explosive Hazard Detection, Explosive Hazard Vapor and Particle Detection, and Remote Visualization.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development of Terrain Shaping Obstacles.

Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for Terrain Shaping Obstacles.  The obstacles will deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace.  Area Denial Capability Development provides controlled scalable effects against mounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, delay or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to shape the battle space of an area without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement, and to actively detect and engage the enemy at all operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system, modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Dominating Mobility Through Terrain Shaping and Engagement (DMTTS&amp;E) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) on 3 October 2014.  The DMTTS&amp;E ICD documents Terrain Shaping Obstacle (TSO) requirements at all operational ranges including those within line-of-sight and those that are beyond line-of-sight.  The Army awarded four concept prototype contracts/agreements to develop representative prototypes (hardware and/or models) which were used to assess the TSO concepts, technical risks, and costs of potential munitions systems and associated capabilities.  The Army intends to develop the TSO munitions system and associated capabilities.  The TSO system will eventually be packaged into various delivery methods for employment at all operational ranges; however, the Army plans to initially demonstrate the TSO capability at close operational ranges.  The Army intends to competitively award up to two Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contracts/agreements in FY 2019 to develop competing prototypes of the TSO munitions and associated capabilities, which includes close-range delivery mechanisms.  As the munitions system matures, the items will be available for integration into additional delivery methods for employment across the entire range of operations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS) funding moves to a separate Program Element starting in FY18.  It will be reflected under PE 655038, Project Code EQ7.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Screening Obscuration Module (SOM) will provide a man portable mountable and dismountable medium area visual screening obscuration capability for the war fighter. The SOM will increase platform survivability and soldier protection levels of maneuver forces by degrading enemy forces ability to detect US targets in the visual and near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The SOM will utilize miniaturized obscuration generator technology to produce an effective visual obscuration cloud to screen against enemy forces.  This effort replaces obsolete technology used in older smoke pots. The individual Soldier or team will employ the SOM devices on open and complex terrain. 

The Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) program provides a Sensor Suite Upgrade (SSU) for the Stryker NBCRV. The NBCRV Sensor Suite is the Mission Equipment Package for the Stryker NBCRV and consists of chemical point detectors, a standoff chemical vapor detector, a biological point detector, a chemical vapor sampling system, radiological detectors, and the Sensor Processing Group.  NBCRV SS provides the Stryker NBCRV the ability to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark NBC Hazards. The Stryker NBCRV SSU will improve chemical, biological and radiological and nuclear detection and identification capabilities, and reduce sustainment costs over the current system.  A Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuver sped when conducting NBC missions and increase reliability.

Screening Obscuration Module (SOM):  The SOM acquisition strategy is a single-step System Integration and Development (SID) phase leading to a Milestone C production decision.  A Full and Open Cost Plus Incentive Fee competitive contract will be used to develop the SOM during the SID phase.  Fixed Price Incentive (Successive Targets) options for production will be included in the contract. The acquisition strategy includes system development and demonstration, full system integration, design for producibility and demonstration of interoperability, safety, military utility and reliability.  

Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS) Upgrade is an upgrade for the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle.  The contract approach of the Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be a Full and Open Cost Plus Fixed Fee competitive prototyping contract.  After the TMRR phase, the contract approach for CSD will be a Full and Open Cost Plus Incentive Fee Engineering Manufacturing Development contract with Fixed Price Incentive Fee options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions. These projects will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats. To achieve this, the Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.

Project 694: 30x113mm Linked Ammunition: Develop and qualify 30x113mm linked ammunition for ground vehicles by increasing precision and lethality capability to defeat personnel and materiel targets as well as the Joint Urgent Operational Need to counter the rapidly evolving threat of Unmanned Aerial Systems. This effort will qualify the links for use in existing M788 and M789 ammunition and develop airburst capable munitions fired from the Lightweight 30x113mm Link Fed Chain Gun. FY 2019 funds will be used to purchase links and linked ammunition, conduct weapon system integration, testing and evaluation, and support the Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) of the 30x113mm weapon system.

High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The 40mm LV HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to engage targets at increased effective ranges using the 40mm M203/M320 Grenade Launchers. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased effective ranges with greater accuracy and lethality. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge. The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability.

The 30x173mm Programmable Airburst Munitions - Tracer (PABM-T) Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) program funds the qualification and procurement of a PABM-T cartridge for rapid fielding in support of the Stryker Operational Needs Statement (ONS) for Increased Lethality. The objective is to enhance the operational effectiveness and lethality of the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV). The cartridge will provide an airburst capability with increased effectiveness against personnel in the open and in defilade over the current tactical solutions.

Project EB8: The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 caliber munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full day/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability. 7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm and .50 caliber cartridges. FY 2019 funding supports continued testing and evaluation of the 5.56mm prototype solutions in order to attain a Technology Level Readiness (TRL) of 6 in FY 2020.

Project EB9: This project is to support the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM). These advanced decoys are necessary to address emerging threats and capabilities deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&amp;E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) from theatre. Continue to develop and prepare documentation for Milestone A decision for the Radar Guided decoy. This decoy is designed to defeat specific threat types. Details of their operation is classified. Conduct initial developmental/operational testing on Cloud CM.

Project EC2: The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158. The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) both 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge for the M240 machine gun and ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm. The FY 2019 funding focuses on calibers below 7.62mm. The objective is to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.  This project is a New Start FY 2019.

Project EC3: This Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. FY 2019 funding will be used to complete verification testing and an operational demonstration for the environmental health monitoring system. FY 2019 funding will also continue verification testing of a next generation temperature/humidity sensor with batch interrogation and historical data retention capabilities, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability, and continue the maturation of the design and fabrication of prototype plastic polymer rectangular containers for developmental 5.56mm ammunition.

Project EL7: The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. FY 2019 funding will support Milestone (MS) B activities to include Request for Proposal (RFP), Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award. Funding will also explore lessons learned from the United States Marine Corp (USMC) .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort and other various options to satisfy the .50 Caliber reduced range requirement.

Project EL8: The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The goal of the LSCA Project is to reduce the total Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight. The LSCA Project will develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges. The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun.

Project EU1: The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) project evaluates, develops, matures, and demonstrates new lethality technologies for 155mm cannon artillery munitions and evaluates their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD). The ELCM project prototypes and accelerates the maturation of enhanced lethality technologies, such as Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT) or pre-formed fragmentation, for 155mm cannon artillery munitions. The ELCM project accelerates the development and maturation of LFT for subsequent integration on the 155mm XM1128 high explosive projectile per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition, 22 December 2016. ELCM also supports prototyping of enhanced lethality technologies applicable to 155mm cannon artillery munitions, including prototyping of projectile design, explosive formulations, fragmentation, and software for the 155mm XM1113 effort, which is a potential long-range cannon projectile that will increase range by 10km or greater and contain twice as much rocket motor grains as the current 155mm long range cannon projectile that is now obsolete. The design requires increased lethality since the projectile contains a reduced amount of explosive to make room for the increased amount of rocket motor grains required for increased range. ELCM addresses requirements for increased lethality above the current U.S. Army go-to-war 155mm high explosive unitary projectiles, the M795 Insensitive Munition and obsolete M549A1 Unitary Munition.

Project EU2: The Improved Multi-Option Fuze (iMOFA/iMOFM) project will identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate new improved multi-option fuze technologies, components, and subsystems based on Government-owned Next Generation Proximity Sensor (NGPS) capabilities with built-in exportability attributes previously matured via OSD sponsored tech base efforts under the Joint Fuze Technology Program and Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Congressional Pilot Program. This project will support technology maturation and risk reduction, and will evaluate and analyze producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in representative realistic performance-related developmental tests. This project will enable fact-based analysis of new Government-owned height of burst/proximity fuzing alternatives that are resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats, quantify their effectiveness, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing/new artillery/mortar fuzes and munitions.

Project FA5: The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions (APWM) project is a continuation of efforts initiated under 644120A-ED5. The objective of this advanced risk mitigation, prototyping and product support effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems in a system of systems environment. The APWM efforts directly support three of the Chief of Staff of the Army's (CSA) "Big 6" Modernization Priorities. Specifically, they support; Long Range Precision Fires, Network/C3I (incl Assured PNT), and Soldier Lethality. The APWM project will enable increased lethality and ensure future battlefield success against peer/near-peer adversaries by supporting these Modernization Priorities. Current and evolving threats to existing Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities have created the need for new/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both Munitions and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment. This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense. As such, both precision weapon and munition programs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army's Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments. FY 2019 funding will support the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's MGUE program and the Army's Assured PNT program including participation in design reviews, evaluation and formal feedback on systems requirements and technology performance, component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a system-of-systems environment, configuration management of the evolving Joint Common GPS Specification and Interface Control Document for Precision Guided Munitions, and specific support focus includes requirements for MGUE Increment 2, Pseudolites (PL), and Alternative Navigation (AltNav) related technology maturity for Assured PNT milestone decisions.

Project FG1: The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) Project will analyze, identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate 155mm Cannon Artillery munition area effects capability. C-DAEM are envisioned as a suite of 155mm artillery munitions, to provide U.S. ground forces with a capability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize and/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area. Initial objective values for C-DAEM would meet Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) effects capabilities against personnel and light vehicles and exceed DPICM effects capabilities against armor. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be completed to best inform necessary area effect lethality requirements. The Project addresses requirements from the U.S. Army adopted U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) [Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) adopted 20 October 2016, Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved 11 May 2016]. The approved C-DAEM ICD as an Army requirement is located in the Capabilities and Army Requirements Documents number 0438. The Joint Staffing Designator is JROC Interest. FY 2019 will support the preparation and evaluation of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for technologies and capabilities identified through the AoA, as well as the development of the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) for each technology.

Project XT5: Lightweight 30mmx113mm (LW30) Airburst is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Production Document (CPD), AH-64E Helicopter, Increment 1, Version 6. The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the warfighter to effectively engage anti-personnel/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel &amp; soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects. FY 2019 continues to support the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction effort.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>30x113mm Linked Ammunition: An existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be used to purchase links for the 30x113mm ammunition. Linked ammunition deliveries will be synchronized with test schedules for ammunition/weapon qualification and Remote Weapon Station (RWS)/vehicle system integration. Ammunition qualification tests and weapon qualification tests will begin in FY 2019. Purchase of linked M788 and M789 cartridges will transition to competitive procurement by FY 2021.  Preparatory activities for initial efforts to develop an airburst capable munition will also be conducted.

40mm Low Velocity High Explosive Airburst (HEAB): The HEAB cartridge will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. As part of the pre-EMD activities, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Testing with contractors will occur to evaluate potential designs. For EMD, two Full and Open competitive contracts will be awarded. After Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E) the government will down-select to a single contractor for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and two production year options.

Stryker 30x173mm Programmable Airburst Munitions-Tracer (PABM-T): A contract will be awarded to purchase MK310 MOD 0 PABM-T (Programmable Air Burst with Tracer) cartridges in support of Safety Confirmation Testing.  A follow on production contract will be awarded for rapid fielding in support of the Urgent Materiel Release (UMR).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber One Way Luminescence (OWL) technology applies to multiple calibers. In FY 2018, Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EB8, 7.62mm OWL will transition to Budget Activity 5 (BA5) PE 0604802A, Project EP4, 7.62mm OWL; the project is not a new start. OWL develops a new tracer technology and applies it to multiple calibers. The initial focus was on 7.62mm ammunition in FY 2015 followed by 5.56mm in FY 2018. As the technology matures the project transitions to PE/Project 0604802A EP4 starting in FY 2018 for 7.62mm, and FY 2021 for 5.56mm. The OWL cartridge will be compatible with all Army Small Caliber weapon systems, but optimized for Machine Guns and will provide improved lethality/target effects over the current tracer munition.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 caliber munitions CDD.  Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter.  The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full day/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm and .50 caliber cartridges.  FY 2019 funding supports continued testing and evaluation of the 5.56mm prototype solutions in order to attain a Technology Level Readiness (TRL) of 6 in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Budget Activity (BA5) Program Element (PE) 0604802A, Project EP4, OWL for Small Caliber Ammunition project is not a new start and the FY 2019 funding continues the development work of 7.62mm OWL cartridges into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).  EMD activities in support of the 5.56mm cartridges begin in FY 2021.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The OWL concept will be developed through Government and Industry prototyping efforts. A Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) was conducted in FY 2015 and FY 2016 to measure the progress of the designs. The FY 2017 TRA was conducted to evaluate the Industry and Government concepts in order to proceed with the 7.62mm Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2018. The 5.56mm and .50 caliber cartridges will follow the 7.62mm schedule with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) starting in FY 2021. The new 5.56mm tracer cartridges will replace the legacy 5.56mm M856A1 tracer.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is to support the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM).  These advanced decoys are necessary to address emerging threats and capabilities deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems.  These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments.  Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms.  These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&amp;E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform Program Managers (PMs) with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) from theatre.  Continue to develop and prepare documentation for Milestone A decision for the Radar Guided decoy.  This decoy is designed to defeat specific threat types. Details of their operation is classified.  Conduct initial developmental/operational testing on Cloud Countermeasures (CM).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) technology has been under development since 2015 and applies to multiple caliber ammunition.  The initial funding resided in Budget Activity 4 (BA4) PE 0603639 Project EC2.  In FY 2017, the funding transitioned from the BA4 Program Element to Budget Activity 5 (BA5) PE 0604802A, Project EP5, Adv Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Cal Ammo and continues the development of ADVAP 7.62mm ammunition.   A follow-on effort to support ADVAP ammunition calibers "below 7.62mm" will commence in FY 2019 under the original BA4  PE 0603639A, Project EC2 Adv Armor-Piercing (AMMO) Small Cal Ammo.  It is not a new start but is an effort to continue the development ADVAP ammunition on calibers below 7.62mm.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158.  The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) both 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge for the M240 machine gun and ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm.  The FY 2019 funding focuses on calibers below 7.62mm.  The objective is to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers.  These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield.  Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization.  The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield.  This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  FY 2019 funding will be used to complete verification testing and an operational demonstration for the environmental health monitoring system.  FY 2019 funding will also continue verification testing of a next generation temperature/humidity sensor with batch interrogation and historical data retention capabilities, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability, and continue the maturation of the design and fabrication of prototype plastic polymer rectangular containers for developmental 5.56mm ammunition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) technology applies to multiple calibers. As the technology matures in FY 2019, Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EL7, Reduced Range Ammunition for the 7.62mm variant will transition to PE 0604802A, Project EP3, Reduced Range Ammunition - Small Caliber. In FY 2020, the .50 Caliber variant will transition from Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EL7 to PE 0604802A, Project EP3.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions.  The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas.  RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ.  This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges.  The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns.  FY 2019 funding will support Milestone (MS) B activities to include Request for Proposal (RFP), Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award.  Funding will also explore lessons learned from the United States Marine Corp (USMC) .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort and other various options to satisfy the .50 Caliber reduced range requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) cartridge case technology will be applied to multiple calibers. The project involves developing and qualifying lightweight cartridge case, starting with 7.62mm ammunition, to replace current brass cartridge case. In FY 2019, Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EL8, Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber will transition to PE 0607131A, Project ER6, Direct Fire Technology.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The goal of the LSCA Project is to reduce the total Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight.  The LSCA Project will develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges.  The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) project evaluates, develops, matures, and demonstrates new lethality technologies for 155mm cannon artillery munitions and evaluates their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD). The ELCM project prototypes and accelerates the maturation of enhanced lethality technologies, such as Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT) or pre-formed fragmentation, for 155mm cannon artillery munitions. The ELCM project accelerates the development and maturation of LFT for subsequent integration on the 155mm XM1128 high explosive projectile per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition, 22 December 2016. ELCM also supports prototyping of enhanced lethality technologies applicable to 155mm cannon artillery munitions, including prototyping of projectile design, explosive formulations, fragmentation, and software for the 155mm XM1113 effort, which is a potential long-range cannon projectile that will increase range by 10km or greater and contain twice as much rocket motor grains as the current 155mm long range cannon projectile that is now obsolete. The design requires increased lethality since the projectile contains a reduced amount of explosive to make room for the increased amount of rocket motor grains required for increased range. ELCM addresses requirements for increased lethality above the current U.S. Army go-to-war 155mm high explosive unitary projectiles, the M795 Insensitive Munition and obsolete M549A1 Unitary Munition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project will support technology maturation and risk reduction, and will evaluate and analyze producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in representative realistic performance-related developmental tests.  This project will enable fact-based analysis of new Government-owned height of burst/proximity fuzing alternatives that are resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats, quantify their effectiveness, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing/new artillery/mortar fuzes and munitions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort will quantify their respective maturity and assess and mitigate the level of risk in providing conventional Cannon Artillery and Mortar munitions a height of burst/proximity fuzing capability that is resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats. Appropriate mature potential solutions will be selected for subsequent transition and technical implementation as an inherent part of improved Multi-Option Fuze programs of record via subsequent Engineering and Manufacturing Development program for Type Classification into existing multi-option fuzes for Cannon Artillery and Mortar Munitions with supporting detailed government-owned Technical Data Packages (TDPs) to enable "build to print" by Industry. The DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) initiatives are utilized to produce the component and fuze prototypes.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions (APWM) project is a continuation of efforts initiated under Budget Activity 4 (BA4) Program Element (PE) 0604120A Project ED5.  The objective of this advanced risk mitigation, prototyping and product support effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems in a system of systems environment.  The APWM efforts directly support three of the Chief of Staff of the Army's (CSA) "Big 6" Modernization Priorities.  Specifically, they support; Long Range Precision Fires, Network/C3I (incl Assured PNT), and Soldier Lethality.  The APWM project will enable increased lethality and ensure future battlefield success against peer/near-peer adversaries by supporting these Modernization Priorities. Current and evolving threats to existing Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities have created the need for new/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both Munitions and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment.  This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense.  As such, both precision weapon and munition programs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army's Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments.  FY 2019 funding will support the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's MGUE program and the Army's Assured PNT program including participation in design reviews, evaluation and formal feedback on systems requirements and technology performance, component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a system-of-systems environment, configuration management of the evolving Joint Common GPS Specification and Interface Control Document for Precision Guided Munitions (PGM), and specific support focus includes requirements for MGUE Increment 2, Pseudolites (PL), and Alternative Navigation (AltNav) related technology maturity for Assured PNT milestone decisions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) Project will analyze, identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate 155mm Cannon Artillery munition area effects capability.  C-DAEM are envisioned as a suite of 155mm artillery munitions, to provide U.S. ground forces with a capability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize and/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  Initial objective values for C-DAEM would meet Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) effects capabilities against personnel and light vehicles and exceed DPICM effects capabilities against armor.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be completed to best inform necessary area effect lethality requirements.  The Project addresses requirements from the U.S. Army adopted U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) [Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) adopted 20 October 2016, Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved 11 May 2016].  The approved C-DAEM ICD as an Army requirement is located in the Capabilities and Army Requirements Documents number 0438.  The Joint Staffing Designator is JROC Interest.  FY 2019 will support the preparation and evaluation of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for technologies and capabilities identified through the AoA, as well as the development of the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) for each technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Lightweight 30mmx113mm (LW30) Airburst is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Production Document (CPD), AH-64E Helicopter, Increment 1, Version 6.  The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the warfighter to effectively engage anti-personnel/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel &amp; soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects. FY 2019 continues to support the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2019 activities include continuing activities to reduce risk and mature technology with a goal of a Technology Readiness Level 6 demonstration of the ability to select airburst or point detonating (PD) functionality when fired from a M230 ground mounted weapon system. Vendors will continue to develop the critical technologies to be designed and tested at the sub-system level for integration into the M789 round. The main effort in FY 2019 will focus on ammunition and system integration which will culminate with the demonstration of a proximity round fired from a ground mounted weapon.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) prototyping provides focused investment for development of the combat vehicles in future battlefields.  The purpose of this funding is to integrate the next generation of technology enabled capabilities developed in the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio to demonstrate new capabilities to meet emerging military needs, provide hardware for Soldier operational evaluation/feedback, to determine integration potential across the current Army portfolio of ground vehicles and to develop platform level prototypes
  
Prototyping allows for aggressive innovation (provides a bridge from S&amp;T investment to vehicle integration and operational use), informs requirements through User Evaluations, ensures requirements are met, mitigates capability gaps and reduces integration risks.

Additional funding in FY 2019 will support working with Industry (via Other Transaction Agreement (OTAs)) on concept development, trade studies, technology maturation/testing, technical/operational/affordability analyses and prototyping and demonstration of combat vehicles (both manned and autonomous) to assess future concepts and designs that integrate emerging S&amp;T advancements to include integration and fusion of data from different sensors and subsystems within the platform and how it will be displayed to the crewman and/or autonomous vehicle operator on the battlefield to improve crew reaction time and platform fightability.  Funding will also support acceleration of the TARDEC NGCV 1.0 Prototype.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The next generation combat vehicle team (PEO GCS in coordination with RDECOM) will oversee a continued public private partnership between organic government and private industry, monitoring and tracking technical progress related to the development concepts and designs for the next generation of combat vehicles. It will mature system level concepts and designs to integrate S&amp;T developed advanced ground vehicle subsystem technologies such as active protection, powertrains, armors, and situational awareness suites into a system level experimental prototype. It will conduct experimental demonstration of a closed hatch Infantry Fighting Vehicle and split-squad operations. It will leverage organic early synthetic prototyping capability to conduct soldier-in-the-loop virtual simulations of future combat vehicle concepts to assess next generation capabilities and conduct system level performance trades. The team will conduct analysis based on all the data currently available from the Future Fighting Vehicle and Squad Centric Mounted Maneuver (SCMM) efforts to inform investments in FY19 and beyond.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>TARDEC will take their existing contract using the OTA and accelerate the IFV build in order to deliver a first prototype by 1Q FY2021. The prototype will utilize latest off-the shelf technologies and have the capability to upgrade to the Combat Vehicle Prototyping (CVP) technologies as they become available. Acceleration of the contract will require modification of the current contract.

NGCV Cross Functional Team (CFT)/PM will use the OTA to submit a call for white papers to Industry for concepts that will show technologies that will improve a combat vehicle (IFV or Tank) in the areas of mobility, survivability, lethality, situational awareness, sensor fusion and demonstrate a path to autonomy. The white papers will be used to award 1 to 2 contracts to build a prototype which will be delivered by 1Q FY2021. Information from the prototypes (both organic and from Industry), along with the parallel modeling and simulation will inform the development of the NGCV requirements.

Demonstrate Sensor Fusion/Crew Station requirements for manned and unmanned systems. Will continue to provide integration support and technology procurement for the software system integration laboratory (SIL). Provide integration support and user evaluation for the crew station SIL. These SILs will allow the integration team to simulate integrated system functionality prior to the actual physical integration of the system. Work performed in these SILs will be critical to the successful mitigation of risk for the integrated systems demonstration by identifying any system integration-related errors as early as possible. Identifying errors early in the integration process will allow the team to develop solutions in a timely and effective manner. Will continue to mature the system level integration of the powerpack (engine, transmission, integrated starter generator, exhaust, air inlet, and thermal management system) along with working new projects in the areas of sensor fusion, which may include, but not limited to, data inputs from Global Positioning System (GPS), Light Detection and Raging (LIDAR), SOund Navigation And Ranging (SONAR), RAdio Detection And Ranging (RADAR), optical Infrared, UltraViolet (UV), etc. Will procure specialty tooling and long-lead items, and will continue to provide software support that is needed for system integration, for the accelerated demonstration.</r2:Text>

Efforts funded in this Project support all four Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency.  The Army serves as the Executive Agent for this Department of Defense (DoD) program, with oversight and coordination provided by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board as required by DoD Directive (DoDD) 3235.02E. Centralized execution of the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Program (CFREP) with Joint Service review and approval eliminates unnecessary duplication of efforts across the Services and maximizes use of common materiel solutions. Prototypes validated within this effort transition to Program Element (PE) 0604713A/Project 548 for System Development and Demonstration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) supports Combatant Command (COCOM)/Army Service Component Command (ASCC) based on emerging rapid equipment requirements.  The REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Memorandum, Under Secretary of the Army, 30 Jan 2014, subject:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF). 

The REF is the Army's Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) with the ability to acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), and non-standard equipment solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for globally employed forces.  It inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select-prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.  The REF assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions to inform materiel development for the future Army capability requirements and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.

The REF bridges the gap between the Army's traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding immediate and effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier Readiness, effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF 10-Liner process provides the ability to react quickly to an ever-changing enemy who changes in days and months, not years in a complex world.  The REF coordinates with the COCOMs/ASCCs in theater to fully understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  Although the REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, it focuses on Brigade level and below to equip solutions to identified capability gaps.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier as the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to institutionalize the acquisition authorities in support of the REF and to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the Soldier's needs serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).  This establishes a formal acquisition reporting chain that leverages existing reporting venues to ensure appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) visibility, oversight, and direction.  

The REF capabilities cross all Warfighter Functions:
1.	Mission Command
2.	Movement and Maneuver
3.	Intelligence 
4.	Fires
5.	Sustainment
6.	Protection 

The REF FY19 RDT&amp;E request is $2.799 million (Base) and $3.000 million (OCO) and is for system integration, testing, and evaluation to support project requirements.   

The RDT&amp;E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, and innovative solutions.  RDT&amp;E funds are necessary in the majority of all REF projects.  Most importantly, REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct safety certification (testing) for non-standard equipment before it is equipped to the Soldier.  This critical requirement exists to ensure that REF-provided equipment is safe for Soldiers to use and that any risks are identified and documented.  The REF also requires RDT&amp;E funds to integrate several different COTS/GOTS and NDI technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems.  RDT&amp;E funds maybe used to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) systems or advanced technologies in conjunction with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs).  Frequently, these technologies only need small amounts of funding to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed U.S. Army Forces problems.  

The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to modify, test, and evaluate existing technologies that were developed for one purpose, however may be suitable to solve another problem.  REF will also fund deliberate projects in support of technology-solution-scouting to meet anticipated Army needs and to mitigate operational gaps.  These efforts measure and identify current technologies, and provide information to better inform Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and other communities of interest, with the intent of enlightening future Army requirements.  Example efforts that may require RDTE include the following projects:  Tactical Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and communications systems; tactical and small Combat Out Post/Forward Operating Base (COP/FOB) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Force Protection systems; Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS); Electronic Warfare (EW) systems; Non-Tactical Vehicles (NTV); Persistent Duration UAS, and Subterranean (SubT) Operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The REF partners with ASCCs forces and Army SOF community to perform DS to globally deployed Soldiers and regionally aligned BCTs.  The REF anticipates increased uncertainty regarding the future of OIR and other operations in the CENTCOM AOR requiring additional flexibility to develop technological solutions supporting the reduced numbers of Soldiers operating globally in order to fill force protection gaps in the face of a smaller and more lethal terrorism threat.  The REF expects to increase our engagement with the ASCCs in order to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints and improve our understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations.   The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Global Response Force as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  In accordance with REF?s participation in the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) led quick reaction capability effort, the Army determined the REF would provide the Army?s warm base capability with ~590 (Base/OCO) requirements in FY17 and beyond.

For FY17 the REF projects ~590 (Base/OCO) requirements in the following REF Warfighter Functions:.

1 ? Mission Command (49K)
2 ? Movement and Maneuver (97K)
3 ? Intelligence  (39K)
4 ? Fires  (4K)
5 ? Sustainment (46K)
6 ? Protection  (91K)

The REF anticipates ATEC testing and evaluation cost of $2.933 million. The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier ? any modified COTS/GOTS/NDI items has to be tested.</r2:Text>

4.	Fires:   $6K  (1.09%)
5.	Sustainment:  $86K (13.97%)
6.	Protection:  $172K  (27.95%)

FY18 funds for projects in the amount of $617K (10% of budget); breakout is based on the FY16 requirements trend.

In accordance with REF?s participation in the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) led quick reaction capability effort, the Army determined the REF would provide the Army?s warm base capability at ~600 requirements in FY19 and beyond.

For FY19 the REF projects ~495 (Base/OCO) requirements in the following REF Warfighter function areas.

1.  Mission Command:  $ 56K    (10.06%)
2.  Movement and Maneuver:  $93K    (16.56%)
3.  Intelligence:  $129K    (23.05%)
4.  Fires:  $2K    (.32%)
5.  Sustainment:  $89K   (15.91%)
6.  Protection:  $191  (34.10%)

The FY19 funds for projects in the amount of $560K (20% of Budget); breakout is base on the FY17 requirements trend.

The REF anticipates ATEC testing and evaluation cost of $2.239 million.  The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier - any modified COTS/GOTS/NDI item has to be tested.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of U.S. Army Forces employed globally.   The REF focus is on rapidly placing capabilities into Soldiers' hands.  This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) rapidly adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs, and 2) developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia.  All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment are provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved acquisition program or terminated through an approved Army process.  Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation and future capability development.  REF capabilities routinely serve as a bridge to specific ONS, JUONS, and JEONS gaps to meet urgent operational requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures.  TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the Analysis and Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination and Feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures. TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the Analysis and Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination and Feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations.  

FY2019 Base funding in the amount of $35.667 million provides for: (1) engineering and collaborative development on multiple validated National Intelligence Community (IC) advanced software and prototype developments that leverage National IC invests for Army use and ensure continuous Army interoperability with National IC assets and architectures, e.g. Information Store (iStore), Scalable User-Defined Real-time GEOINT Environment (SURGE), ADV Pilot, GETS-Cedalion Transition, MERIT project management and transition; (2) Advanced Miniaturized Data Acquisition System (AMDAS) 'Next' system development; (3) advanced development of more effective intelligence collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED); and (4) advanced development of capabilities for Air Vigilance (AV) Army Program of Record; and (5) development of TENCAP Radio Frequency Exploitation (TRFE) effort to support future synchronization of SIGINT, Cyber and Electronic Warfare operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy to Army investments.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&amp;S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National agencies, Labs, Industry Partners and Academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these National capabilities into enduring Army programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element focuses on efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems that facilitate the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices transitioning from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield.

Project VT7 (Soldier Maneuver Sensors-Advanced Development):  This budget item focuses on developing integrated and enhanced products to provide the Soldier with the ability to "fight, win and survive, day and night, in a multi-domain environment now and tomorrow". Products include maneuver capabilities to see, detect, and identify and target acquisition capabilities to identify and mitigate threat forces prior to being engaged. The integration of higher performing multispectral sensors with smart processing will provide automatically adjusted weapon sight reticles and leverage network connectivity to enable improved situational awareness/understanding. Additional capabilities include signature management and resiliency across the electromagnetic spectrum, integration of a modular design structure for laser target acquisition applications, next generation vision system, and mitigation of manned and unmanned threat sensor systems. This project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for development of Soldier-borne sensor devices, transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) stage to operational use. This project includes associated costs for efforts associated with integration and interface of products on the Soldiers' head, body, and weapon.

Project VT8 (Soldier Precision Targeting Devices - Advanced Development):  These efforts focus on Technology Maturation Risk Reduction and on the technology demonstration of component technologies used in Soldier portable precision targeting devices to continue improvements to system performance while reducing size, weight, and power required by those systems. Efforts will improve the Soldier's ability to precisely locate and designate targets across a broader range of operating environments, including all weather conditions.  The technologies developed will support the Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) Target Locator/Designator System (TLDS) and the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR).  Component technology development will precede integration into specific systems and will include improved Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices; solid-state, dual-color lasers for range finding/designation/marking; and electro-optical sensors such as infrared, near-infrared, ultra-violet, and visible spectrum imagers, laser designator spot detection and imaging, and integration of advanced power management technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The PTD functions include laser illumination, optical augmentation and pointing. PTD functions will be integrated into other Soldier systems. The PTD capabilities will be developed in two parallel paths to allow for technology insertions when available. PTD (Overt) provides the maneuver element with an initial solution (Overt) that provides the Soldier with a capability to conduct pre-shot threat detection by detecting and identifying the location. PTD combines the capability of the currently fielded laser systems, thereby reducing redundancy and the Soldiers' load. PTD (Covert) provides the maneuver element with an enhanced solution (Covert) that provides the Soldier with a capability to conduct pre-shot threat detection by detecting and identifying the location of threat optics while remaining undetected.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There is a broad application potential for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations. However, technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it. This Program Element (PE) includes Projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques. It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities. The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential. EQT demonstration/validation is systemic, i.e. applies to a class of systems (e.g., vehicles or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site/installation problem (e.g. unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination). This PE will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the Army environmental quality technology pillars (military materials in the environment, sustainable ranges and lands, compliance, and pollution prevention). All work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e. "technology is heading for user to implement").</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE) was established by Congress in 1990 with a directive to "serve as a national leadership organization to address high priority environmental problems for the Department of Defense (DoD), other government organizations, and the industrial community." The NDCEE Program is a national resource for developing and disseminating advanced environmental technologies. The NDCEE is used to: demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process. The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation. This Project is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations &amp; Environment. In May 2008, the Project name was re-designated from the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters. This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management."

The United States (U.S.) Army's broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others. Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at Army installations. The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>Funding is based upon an established mechanism for project demonstrations and validations that support priority requirements, and a historical growth trend of mission essential requirements across the Services.  Total program costs include program operating and management expenses, and technology demonstration / validation of priority projects. Projects are typically two years in duration and funding is planned for year two of viable current year projects. There are 13 active projects (started in FY16 and 17).  Eight new start projects are anticipated for FY18 (final decision to be made in Dec 2017), out of 24 joint service prioritized and approved demonstration/validation projects. The maximum number of projects will be funded, based on the budget received. It is anticipated 16 high-priority joint service demonstration/validation projects will remain unfunded. Increase in FY19 funding recognizes that high-priority demonstration/validation projects remain unfunded and additional dollars will be used to fund the remaining, outstanding FY18 projects.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NDCEE is a national asset focused on DoD applications that include technology transfer to appropriate DoD organizations.  The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by the NDCEE Technical Working Group (TWG) that includes senior level staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The NDCEE TWG coordinates all NDCEE activities, votes on proposed joint NDCEE projects, and reports back to the EAB Principals.  Working at the tactical levels, three Focus Groups (environment, safety/occupational health, and energy) were established to develop joint projects.  The Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program participating in the Focus Groups also assists in the formulation of suggested environmental technology projects to be demonstrated within the NDCEE Program.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative "shop floor".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) when applicable Congressionally directed and funded tasks.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototypes of environmental quality technologies developed within the Army Environmental Quality Technology program. The Project increases operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities by reducing soldier and worker health risks and environmental quality impacts that would otherwise result in restoration needs and compliance enforcement actions against installations while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army. The Project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating new materials and processes to fulfill the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data. Materials and processes demonstrated under this project are inherently more sustainable than the baseline with respect to environmental, safety and occupational health concerns, thereby reducing life cycle costs incurred by acquisition, industrial base and installation end users.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) implements the provisions of Title 10 United States (U.S.) Code, Section 2350a, Cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) Projects: Allied Countries. The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers. Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and US contractor facilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The goal of this activity is to expand worldwide allied standardization and interoperability through cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the U.S. Army. The execution AR 70-41 responsibilities requires DASA (DE&amp;C) to conduct engagement with key strategy foreign partners in all regions of the world through the SNR(A) program, international agreement negotiations, and other bilateral and multilateral forums involving DASA (DE&amp;C) personnel. This program will fund the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate internationally, such as the NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&amp;D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: 
The goal of this program is to expand worldwide allied standardization interoperability through cooperative research and development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing  per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the of the U.S. Army. 
All projects are test or technical demonstrations to feed into potential new requirements in support of Army Transformation to the Future Force or as product improvements to the Current Force.

List of the programs curently in place:
Communications, Interoperability, and Electronics Technologies
The goal of this project is to develop technologies that enable interoperability among partner countries' command, control, communications, sensors, and information systems.   Efforts under this project include development of a single solution standard avoiding development of multiple unique solutions and leverage existing interoperability standards developed by NATO. Such standards include common doctrine, technical and procedural specifications to make better use of existing information, shared data, leverage national operating picture capabilities and enable the development of interoperability of data, databases, applications, security domains and national networks architectures.  Includes projects formerly titled Multi-National Network Enabled Capabilities, Low Level Air Defense Interoperability, JTRS, Combat Identification, and Multilateral Interoperability Program.

Aviation Systems Technologies 
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly improved aerodynamics, aeromechanics, avionics, weapons and sensor integration, propulsion, and aviation autonomy technologies that improve range, payloads, speed, survivability and lethality to maintain U.S. technical superiority and combat overmatch for vertical lift aviation systems.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Ground Systems Technologies
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly technologies to improve survivability, weapons, ground platforms (manned and unmanned), and mobility and counter-mobility to provide soldiers with unmatched offensive and defensive capabilities in weapons and military vehicles.   Areas of cooperation include ground systems design, propulsion, structures, robotics, alternative fuels and lubricants, systems integration, electronics, and power management.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Weapons and Munitions Technologies
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly technologies to improve range, payloads, speed, survivability and lethality to maintain U.S. technical superiority and combat overmatch for Army weapons systems and associated munitions.   Areas of cooperation include fuzing and warhead systems, guidance systems, counter improvised explosive device neutralization, directed energy, and fire control systems.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Armaments Cooperation Enterprise Support
The goal of this program is to expand worldwide allied standardization and interoperability through cooperative research and development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the U.S. Army. This program will fund the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate internationally, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&amp;D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding. This program will also include:  the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (U. S. Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill); the Technical Cooperation Program, and Army armaments cooperation working groups with many nations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. FVL was established in 2009 by the Secretary of Defense to focus all Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift capabilities and technology development, as well as retaining long-term engineering capabilities. In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. In 2017, the FVL was identified as one of the Army's eight Cross Functional Team Pilots, derived from the six Chief of Staff, Army modernization priorities. The development and fielding of FVL will significantly improve vertical lift capabilities providing critical aviation support to the Joint warfighting community.  Increases in maneuverability, range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint can only be achieved through the FVL approach of developing a new aircraft design.  FVL will integrate advancements in technologies and design configurations balanced with appropriate trades to ensure affordability. 

PE 0603801A, Project B47, Future Vertical Lift funding provides for the development of a Capability Set 3 aircraft system within the FVL family of systems.  FVL Capability Set 3 aircraft will conduct Air Assault, Amphibious Assault, Urban Assault/Security, Attack, Maritime Interdiction, Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR), Tactical Resupply, Direct Action (DA), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations in support of Army, including Army Special Operations Command, Marine Corps and Joint forces.  The FVL Capability Set 3 platform will significantly increase speed, range, mobility, and payload over current US Army H-60 and US Marine Corps H-1 aircraft and provide Combatant Commanders with tactical capabilities at greatly increased operational and strategic distances.  The FVL Capability Set 3 Materiel Development Decision was approved in October 2016.  FY 2017 funding provided for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) modeling, simulation, and analysis.  FY 2018 funding completes development and execution of the AoA and begins acquisition planning and strategy development.  FY19 funding will support the completion of a Technical Readiness Assessment and acquisition planning and strategy development, systems engineering support to decompose the draft Capability Development Document (CDD), and the development of Milestone A documentation and Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Contract Requirements Package.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. FVL was established in 2009 by the Secretary of Defense to focus all Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift capabilities and technology development, as well as retaining long-term engineering capabilities. In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. In 2017, the FVL was identified as one of the Army's eight Cross Functional Team Pilots, derived from the six Chief of Staff, Army modernization priorities. The development and fielding of FVL will significantly improve vertical lift capabilities providing critical aviation support to the Joint warfighting community.  Increases in maneuverability, range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint can only be achieved through the FVL approach of developing a new aircraft design.  FVL will integrate advancements in technologies and design configurations balanced with appropriate trades to ensure affordability. 

PE 0603801A, Project B47, Future Vertical Lift funding provides for the development of a Capability Set 3 aircraft system within the FVL family of systems.  FVL Capability Set 3 aircraft will conduct Air Assault, Amphibious Assault, Urban Assault/Security, Attack, Maritime Interdiction, Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR), Tactical Resupply, Direct Action (DA), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations in support of Army, including Army Special Operations Command, Marine Corps and Joint forces.  The FVL Capability Set 3 platform will significantly increase speed, range, mobility, and payload over current US Army H-60 and US Marine Corps H-1 aircraft and provide Combatant Commanders with tactical capabilities at greatly increased operational and strategic distances.  The FVL Capability Set 3 Materiel Development Decision was approved in October 2016.  FY 2017 funding provided for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) modeling, simulation, and analysis.  FY 2018 funding completes development and execution of the AoA and begins acquisition planning and strategy development.  FY19 funding will support the completion of a Technical Readiness Assessment and acquisition planning and strategy development, systems engineering support to decompose the draft Capability Development Document (CDD), and the development of Milestone A documentation and Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Contract Requirements Package.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element supports projects and studies for advanced component development, including prototypes of equipment and sub-systems which provide critical capabilities for Unified Land Operations (ULO), by extending the Commander's available maneuver space into and throughout the littorals, inland waterways and near coastal regions.   Army watercraft equipment enables the conduct of riverine, Logistics-over-the-Shore (LOTS) and Joint Logistics-over-the-Shore (JLOTS), inter and intra-theater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100.01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and it's major components).  Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterways and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conducting operations through littoral entry points (developed, undeveloped, and austere access points) and in non-permissive, and/or denied access scenarios.  The Army uses a spectrum of Army Watercraft systems, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intra-theater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to oceangoing and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems for (LOTS/JLOTS).  The funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, energy efficiency, environmental, regulatory compliance and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will address critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies. To support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, funding efforts will include conducting trade studies, Business Case Analyses (BCA) to inform the requirement development process, and support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The funding enables our compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and compliance with Environmental protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.

FY19 funding will primarily support maturation of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) design for the Modular Warping Tug (MWT), support continued integration of Force Protection, and environmental projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Electric Power (TEP) program was established by the Department of Defense to develop modernized, standard families of mobile electric power sources and power distribution systems for all Services throughout the Department of Defense. Project Manager Expeditionary Energy &amp; Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2) matures and integrates technology that will improve the next generation of tactical power sources in support of all Services. It supports initiatives that are essential to the development and fielding of modernized TEP sources from Watts to Megawatts level that will extend Army operational mission reach and duration through the improvements to efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and interoperability in support of the Army Operating Concept and Multi-Domain Battle. FY19 funding will support test and evaluation of technologies in support of Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP), Management and Distribution Control (MDC), and Command Post Infrastructure Integration (CPI2). Technologies include hybrid power systems, open architecture tactical microgrids, command post infrastructure, and validated methods to prove out suitability and effectiveness. Funding also supports the Joint Operational Energy Initiative (JOEI), a holistic Modeling and Simulation approach to the evaluation of Operational Energy (OE)-related theater-wide impacts of systems and improvements with the vision of reducing Army energy dependency and demand. Program costs include developing concept hardware and executing system evaluations at Army demonstration events and exercises (AEWE, AWA, etc.)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness. This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical Distribution Capabilities which provide improved safety and accuracy while increasing survivability of aircraft, personnel, and equipment. This project develops critical enablers that support the Army in executing future movement and maneuver operations and distributed sustainment support by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Reduces rigging times while also providing the capability to rapidly de-rig loads on the drop zone. This will reduce the lead time to prepare Low Velocity Airdrop System (LVADS) loads while also increasing the survivability of receiving ground forces by ensuring the airdrop loads (to include weapon systems, prime movers, trailers, etc.) are quickly de-rigged and made operational. RRDAS is a three phase Research, Development, Testing and Engineering (RDT&amp;E) effort, Phase I will focus on loads up to 20,000 pounds and platform lengths up to 20 feet and will include prime movers such as HMMWV.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates the potential of prototype equipment and technologies to satisfy petroleum storage, distribution, and quality surveillance system requirements.  The Technology Development programs support the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment.  The mission includes developing fuel quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics footprint; alternative source water acquisition, reutilization and disposal systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; water purification and waste water treatment and material systems to decrease the logistics footprint and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in joint operations area.  This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile joint operations areas.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Early Entry Fluid Distribution System (E2FDS) is a rapidly emplaced, high-throughput petroleum distribution conduit system.  The E2FDS consists of 5-mile systems that can be connected to each other to form a pipeline trace up to 50 miles long.  It can throughput 850,000 gallons of petroleum or 650,000 gallons of raw/non-potable water per day.  E2FDS is emplacement at a rate of 25 miles per day and retrieved at a rate of 10 miles per day.  The components are configured in stackable International Standards Organization (ISO) twenty foot equivalent units (TEU) for deployment and is Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck-Load Handling System (HEMTT-LHS), Palletized Load System (PLS) and PLS Trailer transportable.  It includes a Command and Control Module (C2M) that allows for central control of the pipeline trace from a single location.  The E2FDS complements the Inland Petroleum Distribution System (IPDS) by adding an early entry capability as well as a means for rapidly extending existing pipeline.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds development of medical materiel within the early system integration portion of the System Development and Demonstration phase of the acquisition life cycle using 6.4 (Advanced Component Development and Prototype) funding. Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness. Programs are aligned to meet future force requirements identified within concept documents and organizational structures. This PE also provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans. 

The Projects supported by this PE are: 

Project 808 funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. Efforts include vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures. These funds support human clinical efficacy trials of the drug/vaccine in a larger group that are designed to assess performance and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 849.

Project 811 funds the development of military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. It provides funding for planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use. Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 812.

Project 836 funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. This project also funds the human clinical trials that test the safety and effectiveness of biologics, devices and demonstration. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with United States (U.S.) FDA regulations. Products from this project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 832. 

Project VS7 funds program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the fleet of Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters that continue to play a major role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The approved force design increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) companies. All products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project VS8.

Project CS4 funds congressionally special interest in:Transport Telemedicine - Initiate Joint Advanced Technology Demonstration to provide Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) automatic situational awareness system to identify patients en-route to MTFs and automate paramedic tasks.  

These Projects are managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.

Project FF4 funded Secretary of Defense approved counterdrug advanced development efforts used in a major re-design of the Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory (FTDTL) information management system used to test urine samples for the presence of illegal drugs. The Drug Testing Program - Client Collection System (DTP-CSS) is comprised of several variations of a desktop application used to select service members for random drug testing, prepare labels for urine specimen bottles, and print corresponding chain-of-custody documents. This Project will standardize DTP-CSS across all services and migrate it to a Web-based system.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. These efforts are in: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and to determine if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms capable of infecting service members/preventive medicine measures. These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug/vaccine works, and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices. This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and accelerated recovery time once diagnosed; to enhance battlefield readiness. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members. Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of militarily relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. It provides for the planning and conduct of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess for safety and tolerability of medical countermeasures, how the drug/vaccine is distributed through, metabolized in, and excreted from the body, and to investigate the appropriate dose. Development efforts are focused on militarily unique needs affecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. The cumulative cost of treating HIV-positive DoD personnel is estimated to be $16.6 billion for 3000 personnel over a 50-year lifetime. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA regulations.

Research efforts are coordinated with the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Will continue to seek further complementary immunogenicity (ability to provoke immune response) data from Candidate vaccine trials RV306 and RV328 and will complete the collection of samples for safety and effectiveness of the study. RV403 study will continue in Mozambique, Uganda, and Thailand with adjuvanted AIDSVAX B/E and will continue to collect samples from volunteers. IPT will continue to review Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and disruptive technologies that have the potential to refocus current vaccine effort to a product that has a greater utility for military relevant populations. Down selection of viable vaccine candidates will be made in anticipation of a single phase IIB efficacy trial (trials to evaluate efficacy in patients with the disease) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.</r2:Text>

This Project funds human clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of biologics (products derived from living organisms) and devices necessary to meet medical requirements. When available, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for transition to engineering and manufacturing development. Consideration is also given to reducing the medical logistics footprint through smaller weight, volume, and equipment independence from supporting materials. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Drug Testing Program - Client Collection System (DTP-CSS) is comprised of several variations of a desktop application used to select service members for random drug testing, prepare labels for urine specimen bottles, and print corresponding chain-of-custody documents. This Project will standardize DTP-CSS across all services and migrate it to a Web-based system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Original models of Army Black Hawk Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) helicopters continue to play a major role in maintaining high U.S. troop survival rates in Iraq and Afghanistan by evacuating wounded troops in less than one-hour. In 2009 a Vice Chief of Staff, Army (VCSA)-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs. In 2010, the U.S. Army Medical Department (AMEDD) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC Evacuation Package (MEP) from PEO Aviation. In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes manages the Soldier as a system in order to increase combat effectiveness, test and deliver tangible products that save Soldier's lives, and improve Soldier's quality of life.  It evaluates, develops, and tests emerging technologies and critical Soldier support systems to reduce technology risk.

Project ET8 funding (Personnel Airdrop System) supports efforts to improve Static Line (SL) and Military Free Fall (MFF) personnel parachutes and associated equipment to include canopy improvements based on integration of new technology with the goal of enhancing the insertion capability of the airborne soldier and increasing the performance, safety and durability of personnel airdrop equipment.

Project S53 funding (Clothing and Equipment) supports development of state-of-the-art technology to improve tactical and non-tactical clothing and individual equipment to enhance the lethality, survivability, and mobility of the individual Soldier. 

Project S54 funding (Small Arms Improvement) provides funds to develop, demonstrate and evaluate emerging technology for integration of systems, subcomponents and prototypes designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition, fire control, training effectiveness and reliability for current and future small arms weapon systems and ammunition.

Project VS4 funding (Soldier Protective Equipment) supports efforts to evaluate integrated technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Individual Soldier Ballistic Protection technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Soldier uniform and clothing technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide a modular, integrated uniform/clothing system from skin out and head-to-toe. It funds efforts to investigate new technologies and domestically available fabrics with Flame Resistant (FR), moisture wicking, insect protection and camouflage technologies, including evaluation and integration of fabrics appropriate for uniforms and equipment used in jungle/tropical and arctic environments. New technologies are investigated to monitor health and improve Soldier survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort in combat and training/administrative environments. Includes integration and interface on the Soldier system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2018 funding for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) Robotics Development (RD) transitioned from PE 0604641A Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle, Project DV7 Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle to PE 0604017A Robotics Development, Project FD2 Soldier Robotics Systems, and funding for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) transitioned from PE 0604641A Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Project DV7 Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle to PE604017A Robotics Development, Project FD9 Robotics Systems.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>FD2: Soldier Robotics Systems for Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing / transitioning technology.  Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives / Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation / transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle and maneuver under their own power. 

FY 2019 RDTE funds enable support to capability development of the Common Robotics System (Vehicle), Common Robotic System (Light Reconnaissance) Robot (LRR) (CRS(LR)), Common Robotic System (Universal Controller) (CRS(UC)), Common Robotic System (Communication Link) (CRS(CL)), Common Robotic System (Mission Command/Artificial Intelligence) (CRS(MS/AI)), Render Safe - Sets, Kits and Outfits (RS-SKO), Enhanced Robotics Payload (ERP), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN); small, pocket sized, airborne sensors, etc. Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision).  

FY 2019 RDTE funding also supports the Soldier Exoskeleton. The Exoskeleton amplifies the strength, endurance, and mobility of its operator, the Soldier. The Soldier Exoskeleton capabilities provide the Army with a deployable, personal tactical performance enhancer. Soldier Exoskeleton variants will be capable of operating in a wide range of environments, enhancing combat operations.

FD3: The Battery Modernization &amp; Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier, and to reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just three. Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.

FD9: Robotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing / transitioning technology.  Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives / Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation / transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits.

FY 2019 RDTE funds enable support to capability development of Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Dismounted Engineer Mobility System (DEMS), modular mission payloads, Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Robotic Combat Vehicle - Robotic Wingman (RCV-RW), etc. Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision).  

FY 2019 RDTE Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems funding supports Leader Follower and Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitions from Technology Demonstrations to Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) development and initial prototype testing.  This will stress the autonomy systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations.

FD9: Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF) will provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. TWV-LF will provide capability for a manned Leader vehicle with up to seven (7) unmanned Follower vehicles. Initial efforts by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) will control up to three (3) optionally manned Follower vehicles with a designated Leader vehicle. The manned Leader vehicle wirelessly provides direction and speed guidance to the Follower vehicles to follow the Leader vehicle with no driver input or unmanned. The primary purposes for Leader Follower are to improve Force Protection and increase Logistics Throughput. Funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology.

FY 2019 RDTE Leader Follower funding will continue the fabrication and testing of up to 140 Leader Follower PLS A1 vehicles for user operational assessment in FORSCOM identified units.  Systems will go through an Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) safety assessment and plan for Urgent Materiel Release based on the signed Leader Follower Directed Requirement.  The issued Leader Follower systems will go through a 12 month Operational Technology Demonstration on CONUS installations to provide user feedback and assessment on the truck performance to inform a future milestone decision for a follow on Leader Follower program of record.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle and maneuver under their own power. 

FY 2019 RDTE funds enable support to capability development of the Common Robotics System (Vehicle), Common Robotic System (Light Reconnaissance) Robot (LRR) (CRS(LR)), Common Robotic System (Universal Controller) (CRS(UC)), Common Robotic System (Communication Link) (CRS(CL)), Common Robotic System (Mission Command/Artificial Intelligence) (CRS(MS/AI)), Render Safe - Sets, Kits and Outfits (RS-SKO), Enhanced Robotics Payload (ERP), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN); small, pocket sized, airborne sensors, etc. Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision).  

FY 2019 RDTE funding also supports the Soldier Exoskeleton. The Exoskeleton amplifies the strength, endurance, and mobility of its operator, the Soldier. The Soldier Exoskeleton capabilities provide the Army with a deployable, personal tactical performance enhancer. Soldier Exoskeleton variants will be capable of operating in a wide range of environments, enhancing combat operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Battery Modernization &amp; Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier, and to reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just three. Expand to include batteries for generators and hybrids, robotics, vehicles, and low density/usage systems.  Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Robotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing / transitioning technology.  Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives / Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation / transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits.

FY 2019 RDTE funds enable support to capability development of Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Dismounted Engineer Mobility System (DEMS), modular mission payloads, Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Robotic Combat Vehicle - Robotic Wingman (RCV-RW), etc. Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision).  

FY 2019 RDTE Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems funding supports Leader Follower and Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitions from Technology Demonstrations to Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) development and initial prototype testing.  This will stress the autonomy systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations.

Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF) will provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. TWV-LF will provide capability for a manned Leader vehicle with up to seven (7) unmanned Follower vehicles. Initial efforts by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) will control up to three (3) optionally manned Follower vehicles with a designated Leader vehicle. The manned Leader vehicle wirelessly provides direction and speed guidance to the Follower vehicles to follow the Leader vehicle with no driver input or unmanned. The primary purposes for Leader Follower are to improve Force Protection and increase Logistics Throughput. Funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology.

FY 2019 Leader Follower funding will continue the fabrication and testing of up to 140 Leader Follower PLS A1 vehicles for user operational assessment in FORSCOM identified units.  Systems will go through an Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) safety assessment and plan for Urgent Materiel Release based on the signed Leader Follower Directed Requirement.  The issued Leader Follower systems will go through a 12 month Operational Technology Demonstration on CONUS installations to provide user feedback and assessment on the truck performance to inform a future milestone decision for a follow on Leader Follower program of record.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>RCV Risk Reduction effort will install by-wire kits onto M113 vehicles to enable them to be operated remotely.  Platforms will be completed by the end of FY19 for integration with autonomy package and follow on shake out testing.  The RCV Experimental Unit Prototyping effort will award multiple contracts to industry partners to develop mobility platform demonstrators, remote lethality systems and aided target recognition systems that are high risk subsystems for the RCV prototypes.  Contractors will have approximately 18 months to get their systems ready for a system evaluation at the end of FY20.  Virtual assessment tools will be used throughout the development process to get contractor designs into a gaming environment for early soldier evaluations and feedback.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Robotics Development (RD) is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&amp;T) projects into emerging programs of record.  It informs the acquisition process early in the development cycle allowing key stakeholders the ability to make integration decisions and affordability trades while writing requirements.

Tank Automotive Armaments Research Development &amp; Engineering Center (TARDEC) funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology.  The Army will build, and test prototype systems for safety release, Soldier use, and further technology maturation.  

Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (PdM ALUGS) builds upon the TARDEC Expedient Leader Follower (ELF) Operational Technology Demonstration (OTD) to provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. Efforts include Capabilities Document input, close monitoring of OTD activities that feed cost estimates, capture technical and test data, provide test support, develop Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities, and develop a Software Integration Lab (SIL).

Automated Convoy Operations (ACO)/ Robotic Combat Vehicle - Robotic Wingman (RCV-RW)  funding supports Systems Engineering, Requirements, Cost Analysis, Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) support, and technology transition plans.

Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Experimental Unit Prototyping will provide purpose built unmanned combat vehicles to enable users to assess the capability of the platforms and created new CONOPS and doctrine for manned/unmanned teaming based operations.  Efforts will inform new CONOPS, identified system limitations and benefits and provide an achievable, analytically backed basis for future RCV requirements documents to drive future acquisition programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds experimental prototyping and technical demonstrations of selected technologies conducted by Cross-Functional Teams (CFT) in order to inform and refine the development of initial capability documents in support of Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV), Future Vertical Lift (FVL), Network Command, Control Communication, and Intelligence (NC3I), Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (APNT), Air and Missile Defense (AMD), Soldier Lethality, and Synthetic Training Environment (STE).  Funding facilitates the experimentation and demonstration of priority technologies to ensure that planned capabilities are technologically feasible, affordable, and available to Soldiers. Benefits include the narrowing of capability gaps by developing capability documents and rapidly transitioning leader-approved capability requirements to the Army Acquisition System.  In project CF1, CFT will conduct pre-Materiel Solution Analysis Phase experimentation and technical demonstrations to enable capability document development and improve the decision making for potential programs of record.

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2019 funding in the amount of $9.765 million supports Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for new start programs that do not yet have a Program Manager assigned and to augment PM funds where requirement decisions drive changes in scope or increased fidelity to achieve Congressional intent and interest.  AoA initiation, scope, and fidelity are determined through the AROC process prior to the materiel development decision. Current projections indicate multiple new start programs will need to start their AoA in FY 2019, including Unified Network Operations, Common Operating Environment, Cyberspace Situational Understanding, Offensive Cyberspace Operations, Mobile Armored Combat Earthmover, and Synthetic Training Environment.  In addition, several AoA started in FY 2018 will continue to require analysis funding into FY 2019, to include Vehicle Protection Suite, Terrestrial Layer Intelligence Support for Multi-Domain Battle/Joint Combined Army Maneuver, Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System, and Advanced Threat Detection System.  In the Spring of 2018 (on or about 1 May) we will provide the Committee an updated listing of projected FY 2019 new start program AoAs.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS) is a critical system in the multi-domain battle concept that will employ cross-domain capabilities at all echelons and allow ground based forces to project power from land into other domains to defeat highly capable enemies, secure terrain, and consolidate gains.  FUAS encompasses an array of capabilities from platoon soldiers to Division Commanders.

Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) is a new start program. To fully enable these desired cross-domain capabilities, FTUAS will leverage universal and scalable control interfaces and plug-and-play, advanced payloads to optimize manned-unmanned teaming for air and ground maneuver units across all environments. These systems will employ multi-domain capabilities increasing the Army's ability to generate overmatch, provide the ground commander with multiple options, and enable joint force freedom of maneuver. Key attributes of the FTUAS include: (1) Reach: Expeditionary maneuver and mobility through increased speed, range, endurance, and payload capacity; (2) Protection: The capability and capacity to operate across a wider depth and breadth of domains, including high threat and denied environments, with assured communications, navigation, and reduced visual, electronic, and audio signatures able to overcome enemy countermeasures in high threat, anti-access and area denial (A2AD) environments; and (3) Lethality: A broad range of sensors and cross-domain fires that increase the speed of detecting, acquiring, identifying, and prioritizing targets to suppress, neutralize, and destroy enemy forces.

FTUAS will consist of an aircraft subsystem that will include the airframe, propulsion, avionics, communications, navigation, and software systems; aircraft-specific ground support equipment including take-off and landing systems, power generation, transportation, or unique command and control equipment; aircraft software; and required engineering, logistics, and programmatic support.

The Material Development Decision (MDD) for FTUAS is planned for FY21 followed by a 12 month Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). At the end of the AoA phase TRAC Leavenworth will present findings and conclusions based on the collected and analyzed data. FTUAS will be prepared to proceed to the appropriate acquisition milestone based on Army's decision.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Lower Tier Air Missile Defense (LTAMD) Capability program will provide the required sensing capabilities in the lower tier portion of the ballistic missile defense battlespace. The acquisition program will competitively select the sensor/radar set (RS) to replace the baseline PATRIOT RS (AN/MPQ-65A) due to threat changes and the growing obsolescence and high Operational &amp; Support (O&amp;S) cost of the existing RS. The LTAMD Capability will address critical capability gaps, modernize technology, reduce O&amp;S costs, mitigate obsolescence, and increase reliability and maintainability. The LTAMD Capability will increase sensor/radar performance to maximize the inherent PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhanced (MSE) Interceptor capabilities to engage threats.

Lower Tier Air Missile Defense (LTAMD) Capability tasks include the programmatic and engineering activities needed for LTAMD-Capability post Milestone A activities, and preparation required to execute the competitive Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) agreement. Once proposed TMRR materiel solutions have been evaluated, the development effort for LTAMD Capability will continue into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to enable the prototyping, development, and testing of the LTAMD Capability. 

FY2019 base dollars in the amount of $120.374 million continues Lower Tier Missile Defense Capability to include programmatic and engineering activities needed for TMRR activities described above.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) satisfies the Warfighter's capability requirements in the integrated air and missile defense domain. The program provides the required sensing capabilities in the lower tier portion of the air and missile defense battlespace and expands the battlespace for the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor. The Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved LTAMDS requirements in April 2016. The Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) draft LTAMDS Capability Development Document (CDD) synchronizes Warfighter needs with AROC-approved requirements.

LTAMDS will competitively select the sensor/radar set (RS) to replace the baseline PATRIOT RS (AN/MPQ-65A) to address emerging advances in threat systems, which, coupled with the growing obsolescence and high operations &amp; support (O&amp;S) costs of the current lower tier sensor, drives a materiel solution. Consequently, the collective purpose of LTAMDS is to address critical capability gaps using state of the art technology, reduce O&amp;S costs, mitigate obsolescence, and increase reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M). 

LTAMDS FY2019 funding requirements include continuation of incremental funding up to three contractors conducting engineering and prototyping activities to integrate components into the next higher assembly (known as Line Replaceable Unit (LRU)), and Government/Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) knowledge point and functional reviews of vendors' prototypes.  Additionally, LTAMDS will initiate programmatic and contracting efforts for the development of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  Additional funding allows early software design development and the beginning of software testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To enhance the Warfighter's lethality, survivability, and combat effectiveness, the Army is using the Department of Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium Other Transaction Agreement (DOTC OTA) for Concept Definition (CD) efforts. Based on CD results, the Army plans to continue using the DOTC OTA process to conduct TMRR activities.  DOTC OTA promotes non-traditional contractor involvement, accelerates schedule, provides early government-contractor dialogue, provides detailed contractor cost and schedule estimates, verifies industry readiness, and informs the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on materiel solutions and design concepts for milestone events.

Since this time last year, engagements with industry have enabled refinement of the schedule to accelerate capability.  Utilizing DOTC contract agreements with four consortium members has better informed the Army.  Through this refinement and agreement the net effect is acceleration of schedule and capability.  

The LTAMDS program will pursue a competitive approach that delivers the best materiel solution to meet LTAMDS performance requirements within cost and schedule. Using the DOTC process, the Army competitively selected four contractors for CD and will select up to three contractors for TMRR. Leading up to MS B, the Army will explore the continued use of OTAs to select a single contractor for EMD.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds experimental prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced ground systems, aviation systems, command, control, communications &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment, precision weapons, High Energy Laser (HEL) systems, and Soldier equipment. Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios, as well as the maturation and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Benefits include maturing technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, informing emerging requirements for future programs of record, and reducing technology risk in order to transition of leap-ahead capabilities into acquisition programs. In Project DS3, Technology Maturation Initiative efforts mature and integrate advanced component technologies into system and sub-system technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes, which are then validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and programs of record. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms. Project EX3 funds experimental prototyping and demonstration of ground vehicles to assess future concepts and designs against selected capability trades, and emerging technologies for current and future combat vehicles across the combat vehicle portfolio. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts and acquisition programs.  Efforts in this PE support the Cross-Functional Teams established by the Army to speed materiel development activities in support of the Army Modernization Priorities.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering S&amp;T priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. This investment supports the Army Modernization priorities, including future capability opportunities for the Network, Next Generation Combat Vehicle, and Air and Missile Defense.

Work in this PE is performed by Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), the Engineer Research Development Center (ERDC), and US Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the maturation, integration, and demonstration of advanced technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes to support advanced ground systems; aviation systems; command, control, communication &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment; precision weapons, High Energy Laser (HEL) systems; and Soldier equipment. Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) efforts mature and integrate component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes are validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation and acquisition efforts to inform requirements for future programs of record and reduce the risk of technology insertion. These efforts are typically 2-4 years in duration, and are approved by Army senior leadership based on priority and opportunity, to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Activities include the maturation, integration, and demonstration of HEL prototype weapons performance on a combat platform in realistic operational environments, in support of the Army's objective capability for Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD). A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sensors, and optics for maneuvering brigade combat teams (BCTs). Activities also include sub-system prototyping and integration of leap-ahead ground combat vehicle powertrain technologies; and integration and demonstration of key Active Protection System (APS) components to provide modular and layered vehicle protection effects (hard-kill and soft-kill), enabling power projection and enhanced survivability. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms.

                                <r2:Description>This effort matures and integrates a 50 kW-class laser system into a Stryker platform, providing a system-level, High Energy Laser (HEL) experimental prototype for demonstration in realistic operating environments. These demonstrations will inform requirements, decrease risk for future Army HEL acquisition programs, and support the future development of warfighter Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and Concept of Operations (CONOPS). HEL weapon systems are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to stockpile ordnance. A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM); UAVs; sensors; and optics for maneuvering BCTs. Demonstrations will also inform potential future capability to defeat both fixed- and rotary-wing manned aircraft. Leveraging Government investments and Industry technology advancements, will review and select existing HEL subsystem designs for integration into a Stryker vehicle; will conduct integration and demonstration of a system-level HEL experimental prototype; and will provide assessment of technical performance in an operational environment.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the prototyping and demonstration of ground vehicle technologies. The main goals are to conduct technical assessments against selected capability trades and future technologies for current and future combat vehicles across the combat vehicle portfolio. The funding will support continuing advanced concept development, trade studies, technology maturation/testing, technical/operational/affordability analyses, and system and subsystem iterative and integrated prototyping to assess future designs that integrate emerging science and technology advancements for current and future combat vehicles and to inform the Army's Force 2025 Maneuvers campaign of learning.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy.

This work is fully coordinated with and complementary to Program Element (PE) 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), and PE 0603645/EV7 (Armored Systems Modernization Advance Development/Combat Vehicle Prototyping).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army has a need to improve capabilities to defend maneuver formations and other tactical echelons from low altitude air attack and surveillance. Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten the ability of maneuver forces to conduct operations.  Specifically, maneuver formations require improved air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Rocket Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.  

This additional capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach that enables rapid fielding of an initial capability, culminating in a program of record that will field a full capability.  Initially, the Army will field an interim M-SHORAD solution using an Army Senior Leader Directed Requirement, informed by an FY 2017 M-SHORAD Demonstration.  The system or system-of-systems solution will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), and Group 1 - 3 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) while keeping pace and surviving with the maneuver Brigades.  This interim solution will be fielded in up to three M-SHORAD battalions. The objective solution is needed to counter FW, RW, UAS, and indirect fires (RAM) threats. Both mounted and dismounted capabilities are required. As part of the objective solution, the 50 kilowatt laser will be assessed for possible transition from Science Technology to an objective M-SHORAD program in FY2022. 

FY 2019 base and OCO dollars in the amount of $118.085 million will continue the interim M-SHORAD capability development and integration of the identified solution into existing maneuver formation equipment. Efforts will include: complete fabrication of production representative articles; begin testing to achieve Urgent Materiel Release; and continue the development and finalization of the required program documentation.

Additionally, FY2019 funds will continue development of an objective M-SHORAD Family of Systems, to include: complete the objective M-SHORAD Family of Systems Analysis of Alternatives (AoA); complete development and approval of all Milestone A documentation; begin Concept Design Development for all M-SHORAD Family of Systems variants, and continue Contract Package development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) will provide the Army's ground maneuver forces access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT Global Positioning System (GPS) may be limited or denied.  Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated 05 Apr 2010, approved the Positioning, Navigation and Timing Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on 30 Jul 2013.  The Assured PNT draft Capabilities Development Document was validated by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) on 28 Jul 2014.

PNT is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system vulnerable to current and emerging threats, and field conditions (e.g. urban, dense vegetation), which means Warfighter assured access and integrity to PNT is not guaranteed.  This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore, current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.

Assured PNT is a system of systems consisting of one project (ED5) Assured PNT and four separate and interdependent PNT products; (EH8) Dismounted A-PNT System, (EH9) Pseudolite, (EJ2) Mounted A-PNT System, and (EJ3) Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS).  These interdependent PNT products assure access to and integrity of PNT information.  Each product provides a degree of standalone capability that can be leveraged across the solutions and enterprise enablers to raise the capabilities in all environments and across all formations and warfighting functions.  Program Manager (PM) PNT manages these four products (Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System, and AJAS) constructed to develop, test, field, and sustain the A-PNT materiel solution.  

The overall mission of PM PNT also includes experimentation and demonstration activities aligned with the Secretary of the Army and Chief Staff of the Army modernizations areas. The final acquisition and contracting strategy are under development.

Assured PNT consists of:
(ED5) - The Assured PNT funding line originally represented the entire program prior to breaking into four separate funding lines. The FY17-FY22 funding is for PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing and Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) to legacy GPS systems.

(EH8) - The Dismounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) System is a Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) optimized military Global Positioning System (GPS) and non-GPS sensor suite that acquires and distributes trusted PNT data to soldier-borne systems.

(EH9) - The Pseudolite system provides area protection and PNT Assurance in GPS denied environments by providing terrestrial radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal.

(EJ2) - The Mounted Assured PNT System fuses military GPS with physics based sensors and timing technology to acquire and distribute secure trusted PNT data to tactical client systems on vehicular and watercraft platforms.

(EJ3) - The Anti-Jam Antenna Systems (AJAS) provides GPS signal point protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through anti-jam technologies. AJAS enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments.

There are no FY 2019 Base funds. Program Element (PE) 0604120A transitions to PE 1206120A beginning in FY19.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Highly accurate Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army forces to execute their mission.  The Army requires ground maneuver forces access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System (GPS) military advantage on the battlefield. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field conditions.

Pseudolite (satellite-like transmitters) assure GPS access and integrity by providing PNT via terrestrial and airborne-based radio navigation GPS transmitters in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. Area protection is provided through the deployment of Pseudolite transmitters supporting a Brigade Combat Team area of operations. Pseudolite supports continued operations of PNT-enabled systems such as Blue Force Tracker, Communications Networks and Precision Guided Munitions. Pseudolite consists of three segments: 
1.  Pseudolite Transmitter segment provides terrestrial and airborne radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a high power signal.
2.  Command and Control (C2) segment to control the Pseudolite transmitters on the battlefield.
3.  Receiver segment, which will develop software upgrades to current and future military GPS receivers to receive and process the Pseudolite signals.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) is a system comprised of products including Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System, and Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS), to assure access to and integrity of PNT information.  Each product provides a degree of standalone capability that can be leveraged across the solutions and enterprise enablers to raise the capabilities in all environments and across all formations and warfighting functions.  Program Manager (PM) PNT manages these products (Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System, and AJAS) constructed to develop, test, field, and sustain the A-PNT materiel solution. 

The final acquisition and contracting strategy are under development.

The Pseudolite Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition strategy was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority and Milestone A was successfully completed in May 2015.  The Pseudolite product is currently in the TMRR Phase of the acquisition life-cycle.

The TMRR Acquisition Strategy for Pseudolites includes: 1) Technology maturation of the Transmitter segment through the use of two prototyping, cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts; 2) Command and Control (C2) segment will leverage the development by other DoD agencies to the greatest extent possible; 3) Receiver segment will make the use of multiple contracts through existing vehicles for Pseudolite Receiver software prototype development.

After successful acquisition decision, development, integration and testing of the Pseudolite solution will begin.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) System provides PNT data and is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army ground maneuver forces to execute their mission. Army ground maneuver Forces require access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System (GPS) military advantage on the battlefield. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field condition.

Mounted A-PNT is a scalable form-factor that distributes PNT data to multiple devices (client systems) on mounted platforms.  The system fuses military GPS with physics-based sensors and timing technology to provide trusted PNT data, which allows the Soldier to operate in GPS degraded or denied environments.  Mounted A-PNT System includes receiver software capable of acquiring Pseudolite signals resulting in additional protection for military GPS in denied environments and paces the threat by including a migration path to Military Code (M-Code) and other future technologies.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units at the point of need within the entire range of Multi-Domain Battle tasks in support of Unified Land Operations in a complex operational environment.  STE will be a synthetic environment (virtual, constructive, and gaming) utilizing one world terrain, common authoritative data and models that is cloud-enabled through the Army Enterprise Network, and is service-based through the Common Operating Environment.  The STE will be available for use anywhere a Soldier needs it and will include Soldier and Squad Immersive Virtual Training (S/SVT) capabilities.

FY 2019 base funding of $77.939 million will develop and demonstrate prototype designs to reduce technical risk, validate designs, validate cost estimates, evaluate processes, and refine requirements. Based on refined requirements and demonstrated prototype designs, integrated systems design of the end-item system can be initiated. Additionally, these efforts ensure the level of expertise required to operate and maintain the product is consistent with the force structure.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funding in years prior to FY17 on BA4, PE 0604319/DU3 was for IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system development.  Funding for FY17 and out for IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system development activities has been realigned from BA4, PE 0604319/DU3 to BA5, PE 0605052/EY7 as the program transitions to EMD.  Funding for FY18 and out is programmed for Expanded Mission Area Missile (EMAM) interceptor.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>EMAM program supports the overall Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture and expands the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) Block 1 system's target set by enabling an initial counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) capability while providing a second kinetic interceptor capability against Cruise Missiles (CM) and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).

The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that is designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat the UAS, CM, and RAM threats.  Initial IFPC 2-I system development was funded on this line through FY16. The system provides 360-degree protection and simultaneously engages threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system consists of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM defeat mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I system is compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I system is transportable by Army common mobile platforms. 

FY2019 base dollars in the amount of $51.030 million funds integration and testing of a EMAM interceptor into the IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 Multi-Mission Launcher.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Funding in years prior to FY17 on BA4, PE 0604319/DU3 was for IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system development.  Funding for FY17 and out for IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system development activities has been realigned from BA4, PE 0604319/DU3 to BA5, PE 0605052/EY7 as the program transitions to EMD.  Funding for FY18 and out is programmed for Expanded Mission Area Missile (EMAM) interceptor.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The EMAM program supports the overall Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture and expands the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) Block 1 system's target set by enabling an initial counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) capability while providing a second kinetic interceptor capability against Cruise Missiles (CM) and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).

The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that is designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat the UAS, CM, and RAM threats.  Initial IFPC 2-I system development was funded on this line through FY16. The system provides 360-degree protection and simultaneously engages threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system consists of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM defeat mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I system is compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I system is transportable by Army common mobile platforms. 

FY2019 base dollars in the amount of $51.030 million funds integration and testing of a EMAM interceptor into the IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 Multi-Mission Launcher.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) cyber forces with a standardized training capability with access to existing Cyber Training Ranges (CTR) and available training resources and content. The current environment does not have the capacity to maintain a persistent environment and is primarily used for major exercises (i.e. Cyber Flag).  The service cyber components have established their own training environments but do not have standardized capabilities or content. PCTE system approaches are aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD AT&amp;L) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, "Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations," dated 17 November 2015. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) was designated as the DoD Acquisition Lead for the PCTE. Program is directed by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1645. Prototype, integration, and testing efforts in FY19 will complete the capabilities required to meet Initial Operational Capability (IOC) per the PCTE Executive Board developed IOC definition.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) program will employ an incremental acquisition strategy. The strategy leverages the use of existing cyber contract and Other Transaction Authorities (OTA) vehicles in FY17 and FY18 to provide high priority capabilities.  PCTE will provide iterative capability in prototypes provided to the Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) in drops for further evaluation.  These capability drops will be based on requirements contained and further developed as part of the PCTE Information System Capability Development Document (IS CDD).  Efforts in FY19 focus on expanding access, developing, integrating, and evaluation prototype capability drops. In addition, limited capabilities provided in prior years will continue to be improved and developed. A full and open competitive contract will be awarded in FY20 for further integration of new or refinement of existing capabilities, hardware refreshes, accreditation, and software licensing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) will provide the Army's ground maneuver forces access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT Global Positioning System (GPS) may be limited or denied.  Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated 05 Apr 2010, approved the Positioning, Navigation and Timing Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on 30 Jul 2013.  The Assured PNT draft Capabilities Development Document was validated by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) on 28 Jul 2014.

PNT is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system vulnerable to current and emerging threats, and field conditions (e.g. urban, dense vegetation), which means Warfighter assured access and integrity to PNT is not guaranteed.  This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore, current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.

Assured PNT is a system of systems consisting of one project (FJ8) Assured PNT and four separate and interdependent PNT products; (FJ9) Dismounted A-PNT System, (FK1) Pseudolite, (FK2) Mounted A-PNT System, and (FK3) Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS).  These interdependent PNT products assure access to and integrity of PNT information.  Each product provides a degree of standalone capability that can be leveraged across the solutions and enterprise enablers to raise the capabilities in all environments and across all formations and warfighting functions.  Program Manager (PM) PNT manages these four products (Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System, and AJAS) constructed to develop, test, field, and sustain the A-PNT materiel solution.
  
The overall mission of PM PNT also includes experimentation and demonstration activities aligned with the Secretary of the Army and Chief Staff of the Army modernizations areas. The final acquisition and contracting strategy are under development.

Assured PNT consists of:
(FJ8) - The Assured PNT funding line originally represented the entire program prior to breaking into four separate funding lines. The FY17-FY22 funding is for PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing and Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) to legacy GPS systems, and enhancements to Army PNT Enterprise Enablers and capabilities.

(FJ9) - The Dismounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) System is a Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) optimized military Global Positioning System (GPS) and non-GPS sensor suite that acquires and distributes trusted PNT data to soldier-borne systems.

(FK1) - The Pseudolite system provides area protection and PNT Assurance in GPS denied environments by providing terrestrial radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal.

(FK2) - The Mounted Assured PNT System fuses military GPS with physics based sensors and timing technology to acquire and distribute secure trusted PNT data to tactical client systems on vehicular and watercraft platforms.

(FK3) - The Anti-Jam Antenna Systems (AJAS) provides GPS signal point protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through Anti-Jam technologies. AJAS enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments.

FY 2019 Base funds in the total amount of $146.300 million are provided to continue the development of the Assured PNT program. The FJ8 funding line accounts for $59.058 million for PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing, Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) and enhancements to Army PNT enablers and capabilities.  The FJ9 funding line accounts for $15.989 million to complete risk reduction efforts for the Dismounted A-PNT System. The FK1 funding line accounts for $38.302 million for the completion of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase for Pseudolite. The FK2 funding line accounts for $22.816 million to complete risk reduction efforts for the Mounted Assured PNT System. The FK3 funding line accounts for $10.135 million to complete risk reduction efforts for the AJAS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Dismounted Assured PNT System acquires, protects, and distributes secure PNT on dismounted platforms. Dismounted A-PNT System is a stand-alone system and will be used in conjunction with the PEO Soldier Nett Warrior System. Dismounted A-PNT System is planned to be modular, scalable form-factor that paces the threats and includes development and integration of GPS and non-GPS sensors. Dismounted A-PNT System includes receiver software capable of acquiring Pseudolite signals resulting in additional protection for military GPS in denied environments and includes a migration path to Military-Code (M-Code) and other future technologies.

FY 2019 Base funds in the amount of $15.989 million are provided to complete risk reduction/prototyping efforts required to mature critical technologies, finalize documentation required to support the acquisition decision, contracting, and execution of manufacturing development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In accordance with Section 239 of Title 10, U.S.C., the FY 2018 President's Budget established new Program Elements (PE) to account for all of the Department's Space Major Force Program (MFP)-12 programs.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Highly accurate Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army forces to execute their mission. The Army requires ground maneuver forces access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System (GPS) military advantage on the battlefield. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field conditions.

Pseudolite (satellite-like transmitters) assure GPS access and integrity by providing PNT via terrestrial and airborne-based radio navigation GPS transmitters in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. Area protection is provided through the deployment of Pseudolite transmitters supporting a Brigade Combat Team area of operations. Pseudolite supports continued operations of PNT-enabled systems such as Blue Force Tracker, Communications Networks and Precision Guided Munitions. Pseudolite consists of three segments:
1. Pseudolite Transmitter segment provides terrestrial and airborne radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a high power signal.
2. Command and Control (C2) segment to control the Pseudolite transmitters on the battlefield.
3. Receiver segment, which will develop software upgrades to current and future military GPS receivers to receive and process the Pseudolite signals.

FY 2019 Base funds in the amount of $38.302 million are provided to complete the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase required to mature critical technologies, finalize documentation required to support the acquisition decision, contracting, and execution of manufacturing development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) is a system comprised of products including Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System, and Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS), to assure access to and integrity of PNT information.  Each product provides a degree of standalone capability that can be leveraged across the solutions and enterprise enablers to raise the capabilities in all environments and across all formations and warfighting functions.  Program Manager (PM) PNT manages these products (Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System, and AJAS) constructed to develop, test, field, and sustain the A-PNT materiel solution. 

The final acquisition and contracting strategy are under development.

The Pseudolite Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition strategy was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority and Milestone A was successfully completed in May 2015.  The Pseudolite product is currently in the TMRR Phase of the acquisition life-cycle.

The TMRR Acquisition Strategy for Pseudolites includes: 1) Technology maturation of the Transmitter segment through the use of two prototyping, cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts; 2) Command and Control (C2) segment will leverage the development by other DoD agencies to the greatest extent possible; 3) Receiver segment will make the use of multiple contracts through existing vehicles for Pseudolite Receiver software prototype development.

After successful acquisition decision, development, integration and testing of the Pseudolite solution will begin.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This is not a new start program.  In accordance with Section 239 of Title 10, U.S.C., the FY 2018 President's Budget established new Program Elements (PE) to account for all of the Department's Space Major Force Program (MFP)-12 programs.  To comply with this requirement, Program Element (PE) 1206120A project FK2 transitioned from PE 0604120A project EJ2 beginning in FY19.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) System provides PNT data and is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army ground maneuver forces to execute their mission. Army ground maneuver Forces require access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System (GPS) military advantage on the battlefield. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field condition.

Mounted A-PNT is a scalable form-factor that distributes PNT data to multiple devices (client systems) on mounted platforms. The system fuses military GPS with physics-based sensors and timing technology to provide trusted PNT data, which allows the Soldier to operate in GPS degraded or denied environments. Mounted APNT System includes receiver software capable of acquiring Pseudolite signals resulting in additional protection for military GPS in denied environments and paces the threat by including a migration path to Military Code (M-Code) and other future technologies.

FY 2019 Base funds in the amount of $22.816 million are provided to complete risk reduction/prototyping efforts required to mature critical technologies, finalize documentation required to support the acquisition decision, contracting, and execution of manufacturing development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FWC will particapte in the recurring process used to gain HQDA approval of organizational structure changes and designs through the FDU and FDU Jr. processes. This includes the development of Operational &amp; Organizational (O&amp;O) Concept Papers, Organization Design Papers , Cost Benefit Analyses, Unit Reference Sheets (URS), and Manpower Requirements Criteria (MARC) determination.  Particapte in the Total Army Analysis (TAA), the Army's annual process to examine the projected Army force qualitatively and quantitatively.  SMDC/ARSTRAT will support TAA Rule of Allocation (ROA) development, Capability Demand Analysis (CDA) and Resourcing phases to ensure SRC40 units are properly accounted for in the future POM force.  This is performed to analyze the projected Army Force against future demands and levels of funding/authorizations, in order to build the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) Force.  SMDC/ARSTRAT FWC will review the SMDC Troops, Organization and Equipment (TOE) requirements documents conducted as part of a cyclic process as well when needed during other Force Design processes (i.e.?Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) Modernization Path (MODPATH) reviews, Notification of Change (NOFC) reviews, SSN-LIN Automated Management and Integrating System (SLAMIS) reviews, etc.).  Particpate in BOIP Development.  BOIP Development is collection of processes including the cyclic review of Army-wide BOIPs under development, development of Feeder Data for SMDC proponent item BOIPs, and validation of BOIP MODPATHs to SMDC TOEs.  Complete the Space Forces Force Structure Review (FSR) which is a  CBA-like structured three-phased process consisting of a Needs Analysis (NA), Gap Analysis (GA), and Solutions Analysis (SA) to identify and document organizational based capability needs and gaps, develop a prioritized list of  those gaps, and identify potential materiel and/or non-materiel solutions.</r2:Text>

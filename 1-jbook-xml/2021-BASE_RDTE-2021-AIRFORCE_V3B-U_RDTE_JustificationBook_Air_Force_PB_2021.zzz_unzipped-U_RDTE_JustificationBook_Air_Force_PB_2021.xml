                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020,  PE 0301017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), Project 675368, GSIN (Global Integrated Sensor Network, efforts were transferred to PE 1201017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), Project Project 675368, GSIN (Global Integrated Sensor Network, for more accurate classification of work.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.

The Nation's strategic C2 sensors, and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. GSIN developed and established a unified schema that integrates disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership. GSIN also enables existing radars and sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning, execution, and future program planning.

GSIN directly supports USSTRATCOM and other COCOMs and MAJCOM mission sets. GSIN meshes together selected systems and sensors (from tactical to strategic), including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility, and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Repurposing these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. GSIN enables creation of a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. GSIN also improves Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability and provides this data for the larger space order of battle capabilities. GSIN dramatically improves the ingestion of non-traditional, but readily available, non-US government and commercial data to the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) catalog managed by the 18SPCC at Vandenberg AFB. GSIN addresses NORTHCOM/STRATCOM's signed Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) ST-0010 request for uninterrupted traditional and non-traditional sensor data integration and the Global Threat Characterization Assessment (GTCA) Operational Planning Team report. GSIN provides critical and unique data to the large AFSPC SSA data repositories to facilitate the Space Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) suite of capabilities/programs. Finally, GSIN provides Machine Learner and Data Analysis functions to optimize and operate situational awareness in the field.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver &lt;insert program name> weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F,0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds development of the GeoBase Program.  A key initial component of GeoBase is the Common Installation Picture (CIP) which provides the foundation upon which subsequent GeoBase spirals will be built.  The CIP will be developed for active, Guard, and Reserve garrison and expeditionary installations to provide a single, interactive map of our installations.  Warfighters, commanders, planners, and support personnel alike will be afforded unprecedented situational awareness to accomplish their respective missions.  The functional mission sectors will be able to exploit GeoBase to achieve their objectives more effectively, their legacy data will be integrated with the CIP.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) conducts global operations in partnership with other combatant commands, services and U.S. government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the United States.  USSTRATCOM is responsible for command of U.S. nuclear capabilities, space operations, global surveillance and reconnaissance, intelligence, communications, computers, global missile defense and combatting weapons of mass destruction.  To enable completion of these missions, it is recapitalizing the Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES).  NPES is a Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff system for nuclear operations and fulfillment of Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) responsibilities.  NPES supports national strategic deterrence by providing a host of NC2 execution activities as well as contingency and crisis action planning capabilities to selected joint and combatant command staffs.  NPES is operated by USSTRATCOM and other specified users performing missions to deter and dissuade threats, and, when directed, defeat adversaries. 
 
The NPES system has evolved from several single-purpose command and control systems over the past 30 years and has reached a point where it requires recapitalization to meet national and strategic objectives and to comply with future concepts of operation. Additionally, recapitalization is needed to improve cybersecurity, system effectiveness, and supportability. Recapitalization will also seek to lower the total cost of ownership and sustainment.  The recapitalization program will use proven/mature software engineering, technologies, and design tenets to provide a modern, secure, interoperable and reliable Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) software capability. NPES will exploit AFLCMC/HBC agile software development economies of scale to enable developers to build and integrate software at the Top Secret level vice paying to build duplicate capabilities at other government or contractor facilities.

Funds agile software development activities and a secure software development environment, located in existing space at Offutt AFB. Software development environment will meet classification/security regulations/criteria, which will promote competition.

This is a Section 804 Alpha Phase rapid software prototyping effort.  This effort includes decomposing system, functional and non-functional requirements in order to design, build, and field a new NPES application software baseline via agile, development operations (DevOps), and user-centered design principles.  Further, the effort includes developing written artifacts to document system / software engineering elements appropriate for an Agile/DevOps software development effort.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NPES weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F or 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The recapitalization program will use proven/mature software engineering, technologies, and design tenets to provide a modern, secure, interoperable and reliable Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) software capability. NPES will exploit AFLCMC/HBC agile software development economies of scale to enable developers to build and integrate software at the Top Secret level vice paying to build duplicate capabilities at other government or contractor facilities.

Funds agile software development activities and a secure software development environment, located in existing space at Offutt AFB. Software development environment will meet classification/security regulations/criteria, which will promote competition.

This is a Section 804 Alpha Phase rapid software prototyping effort.  This effort includes decomposing system, functional and non-functional requirements in order to design, build, and field a new NPES application software baseline via agile, development operations (DevOps), and user-centered design principles.  Further, the effort includes developing written artifacts to document system / software engineering elements appropriate for an Agile/DevOps software development effort.


This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NPES weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F,0605833F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0301112F, project 674212, DSS Development, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Decision Support Service (DSS) directly supports the senior leader decision making calculus.  Numerous studies, reviews, and practical experience identified the need to create a decision making aid. These identified needs culminated in an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that have been validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  DSS will improve situational awareness, aggregate strategic-level information, provide a common visual display, be resilient, and mobile. Several attempts to provide a DSS-like capability have been attempted over the years.  These ad hoc attempts failed due to the lack of community buy-in and a structured acquisition methodology.  Today, DSS has complete community buy-in and folding it under AFLCMC ensure rigorous acquisition processes will be followed. The program will use the accelerated acquisition process known as Section 804.  USSTRATCOM is the logical home for DSS.  Additionally, DSS accomplishes agile software development activities and a secure software development environment, located in existing space at Offutt AFB.  Software development environment will meet classification/security regulations/criteria, which will promote competition.
DSS is supported by WHMO, OSD, NLCC, and CJCS.  The Service provider is the United States Air Force and the Functional Manager is Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The four (4) aircraft E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) fleet satisfies the military need for an airborne operations center with communications capabilities permitting military and civilian leadership to monitor and control military and civil national assets during all phases of conflict (nuclear and non-nuclear) or natural disaster. The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). 

This program's developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment), and Systems Integration Lab. Additionally, modifications may enhance the aircraft's operations center facilities, to include but not limited to those necessary for the Senior Leadership Command, Control and Communications System (SL3CS), National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC), Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) and other communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Funds may also be used to explore and develop modifications, upgrades, and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements. This budget supports the following developmental modifications and studies/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment:

- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal, and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.

- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program replaces the currently installed Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Transmit system, which is no longer sustainable after over 35 years of operation. In order to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 requirements and ensure there is assured connectivity between civilian and military leadership and military forces during real world situations, this system must be replaced. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Control/Monitor group, a Power Amplifier/Coupler (PA/C) group, and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.

- The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program upgrades the E-4B's Ultra-High Frequency Radio transmitters to be MUOS capable to meet E-4B Capability Development Document (CDD) and CJCSI 6250.01F requirements.  MUOS provides securable data and full duplex voice communications while simultaneously monitoring a second frequency.  The MUOS upgrade will provide interoperability with MUOS waveforms for voice and data communications and with other nuclear and national C2 centers and aircraft by replacing the legacy USC-42 UHF SATCOM radios with a MUOS capable radio.

- Survivable SHF will upgrade and replace portions of the E-4B's Jam-Resistant Secure Communications (JRSC) system to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 and National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-51/Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20 requirements and to ensure continued connectivity and interoperability as satellite and communications infrastructure evolves.  Expected modifications include, but are not limited to, component and sub-system upgrades and replacement of portions of the current SHF system that are obsolete or near end of service life. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure, survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).  A risk-reduction study was completed in FY19 to help further define the acquisition strategy of the SSHF modernization program.  The program will be acquired in 2 phases:  Phase 1 will include technical solutions such as upgrading the existing modems, systems integration lab, and Ka-band system.  Phase 2 will include new modem technology, new Ku-band system, common workstation, and upgrades to the X-band system.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-4B weapon system capability; furthermore, it may include support funding for emerging modification requirements to support PMA, A&amp;AS, equipment and other government cost.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-4B weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F or 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>SHF Modernization will upgrade and replace portions of the E-4B's Jam-Resistant Secure Communications (JRSC) system to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 and National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-51/Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20 requirements, and to ensure continued connectivity and interoperability as satellite and communications infrastructure evolves. A risk-reduction study was completed in FY19 to help further define the acquisition strategy of the SSHF modernization program.  The program will be acquired in 2 phases:  Phase 1 will include technical solutions such as upgrading the existing modems, systems integration lab, and Ka-band system.  Phase 2 will include new modem technology, new Ku-band system, common workstation, and upgrades to the X-band system.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: The acquisition strategy for each specific modification differs based on the urgency of the requirement, definition of the capability, and technology readiness level of the components.  

The Acquisition Strategy for Survivable SHF was approved as a Section 804 Middle Tier Acquisition in April 2019.

Management Strategy:  Program management for all aircraft modifications is executed by the Commercial Derivative Aircraft Division at Tinker AFB.  The Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Presidential and Executive Airlift provides management oversight.

Contracting Strategy:  Contracting strategy differs for each individual modification, but normally includes an initial engineering study contract followed by a development contract.  Production installations and sustainment are typically accomplished with the E-4B Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Advanced Concepts will continue to execute FY19 funds from the MEECN System Improvements (MSI) Program 0303131F, Project 672832. NC3 Advanced Concepts efforts will be moved to PE 0604001F in future budgets.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function. Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces. The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations.

The MEECN portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments.

MSI is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), United States Space Force (USSF), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to monitor and assess the performance of existing NC3 systems and develop recommendations for strategic and tactical architecture upgrades, requirements, and issues based on available and emerging technologies. MSI is used to conduct technology testing; analyze technology strategies; conduct requirement trade space analysis, technology maturation and risk reduction efforts, and mission analysis; and build technology Roadmaps as proactive support to the NC3 community. MSI performs analysis, integration, and testing activities for the NC3 Weapon System.

NC3 Advanced Concepts develops and prototypes NC3 unique and dual-use systems in support of Concept for Force Development (CFD), Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2), and Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) initiatives. This program ensures a responsive design and development engineering infrastructure to address evolving NDO mission requirements, emerging issues and technology insertion/technology application on the NC3 Weapon System, future strategic systems/capability, and other common strategic areas where appropriate, and develop enhanced multi-use capabilities.  The NC3 Advanced Concepts Program will provide technology maturation and risk reduction activities to support the NC3 Weapon System (AN/USQ-225).  Activity will reduce life cycle costs, inform technology maturation &amp; risk reduction efforts, improve system performance, mitigate evolving threats, and ensure both viability and durability of the NC3 Weapon System.

Common Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc 2) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception. The intent of CVR Inc 2 is to develop and produce a common VLF/LF receiver, capable of implementing an interoperable waveform for future platform integration to include airborne and ground based nodes, improved system performance, and reduced supportability costs through commonality. In parallel, the program will lead development of the Special Mode A waveform specification for the USAF and USN to increase reception range and accuracy while shortening required transmission time.  The program will assume responsibility for the sustainment and configuration management of the CVR Inc 1 program's VLF receiver while also providing management support to the B-52 VLF Modernization Program for production and procurement of the AFGSC AF 1067 directed VLF receiver.

Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces and Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS) and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).   Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. Global ASNT Increment 1 (Inc. 1) includes early system engineering support for the planning and development for the future Global ASNT Increments.

Global ASNT Inc. 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment.

Global ASNT Increment 2 delivers a replacement Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of Ultra High Frequency (UHF) as well as High Frequency (HF) personal and general alerting equipment capabilities. Increment 2 replaces aging legacy Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F or 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MSI will continue to evaluate the performance of the NC3 Weapon System by assessing performance and technology areas for improvement with the assistance of expert technical support from FFRDCs, UARCs, and may include competitively awarded technical support contracts with industry. MITRE, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Labs, and Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) will continue to support NC3 Weapon System Architecture Roadmap updates.  

To conduct NC3 Advanced Concepts essential activities a combination of competitively awarded contracts, as well as sole source contracts, may be used to augment AF organic capabilities with technical skill sets from FFRDCs, UARCs, and industry Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) providers. NC3 Advanced Concepts efforts will be moved to PE 0604001F in future budgets.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc 2) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception. The intent of CVR Inc 2 is to develop and produce a common VLF/LF receiver, capable of implementing an interoperable waveform for future platform integration to include airborne and ground based nodes, improved system performance, and reduced supportability costs through commonality. In parallel, the program will lead development of the Special Mode A waveform specification for the USAF and USN to increase reception range and accuracy while shortening required transmission time.  The program will assume responsibility for the sustainment and configuration management of the CVR Inc 1 program's VLF receiver while also providing management support to the B-52 VLF Modernization Program for production and procurement of the AFGSC AF 1067 directed VLF receiver. The program will continue to invest in VLF Modernization activities directed by the VLF Enterprise Program Office to ensure technology and CONOPS are available for incorporation into current and next generation VLF architectures and aligning with integrating with Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global ASNT replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces and Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS) and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. Global ASNT Increment 1 (Inc 1) includes early system engineering support for the planning and development for the future Global ASNT Increments. 

Global ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission Description and Budget Item Justification: The HF Modernization program is designed to replace existing legacy High Frequency (HF) radios with a modernized HF radio on all Air Force (AF) aircraft that currently are equipped with HF radios (e.g., AN/ARC-190).  The current HF radios installed on AF aircraft have reached obsolescence and there is a compelling need to modernize the HF capabilities.  The replacement radio will have similar form and fit, but increased capability. The new radio needs to incorporate new technologies such as 3G/4G Automatic Link Establishment (ALE), wide band features that allow the radio to operate from 3 KHz up to 48 KHz channel spacing, and Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) features. The new HF radio should be software defined (SDR) to accommodate growth for newer technologies and embedded cryptographic options. 

The current AN/ARC-190 radios, that serve a majority of HF airborne needs, will approach end of life ~2025 and do not have current capabilities to be sustainable for future years. Current and future AF aircraft with validated requirements for HF radios will experience a shortage of HF radios starting in FY20. With the increased shortage of spares, as the current HF radios continue to fail, Air Traffic Control (ATC), Air Operation Centers (AOC), and other controlling agencies will lose the ability to communicate with aircraft. HF Modernization provides alternate means of communication when satellite communications are not available due to nature and man-made disruptions. It is essential that these airborne radios keep pace to guarantee interoperability or theater C2 will be degraded.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to, contract services and government costs. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver HF Modernization weapon system capability. The use of such
program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303133F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) - Includes resources, manpower authorizations, necessary facilities and equipment required to perform INFOSEC research and development, to provide INFOSEC services, to procure INFOSEC products required to secure telecommunications and information systems when such products are separately procurable from host systems, and to provide INFOSEC maintenance and support. Also includes costs associated with the protection afforded to telecommunications and information systems which process sensitive data and efforts to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and the system.

The ISSP Element provides cradle-to-grave research, development, acquisitions, supply, sustainment, depot maintenance, and demilitarization of the Air Force (AF) cryptographic and key distribution/management systems (known as the Key Management Enterprise (KME)). ISSP delivers on rising national, DoD, and AF priorities to address cyber security threats and increasing war-fighter dependence on cyberspace. The AF and the DoD require the capability to secure, collect, process, store, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority, the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power in modern, high-tempo, full-spectrum operations. AF Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment protects information such as war-fighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commanders orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness and ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the war-fighter, DoD military forces will suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or exceptionally grave damage to national security. 

The overall focus of the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts within this program is to transform electronic key delivery and cryptographic devices to meet the next generation war-fighting requirements. These efforts are driven by the National Security Agency's (NSA) mandates to address decertifications, new requirements, and end of life issues. NSA's first tenet calls for an AF KME that permits a totally "man-out-of-the-loop" electronic crypto key distribution system from the generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU). This eliminates the current key vulnerability of compromise /interruption by individuals transporting or loading the key. NSA's second tenet requires an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable. This enables more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, lower life cycle costs, and ensured global information grid-compatibility.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

This requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort modernizes cryptographic devices protecting critical national security information across multi-domain operations. In September 2000, the Defense Review Board (DRB) tasked National Security Agency (NSA) to evaluate the security posture of the cryptographic inventory. Systems with aging algorithms, those approaching non-sustainability, and those generally incompatible with modern key management systems were identified and have been replaced or are in the process of being replaced. Priority systems that required immediate replacement were also identified. In addition, NSA documented the need to modernize the cryptographic inventory with capabilities designed to enable network-centric operations. Replacements/Modernization of the near term vulnerable systems must occur within the timeframe specified by device and algorithm in Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization Program was established to develop a modern cryptographic base that provides this assured security robustness, interoperability, advanced algorithms, releasability, programmability, and compatibility with the future Key Management Enterprise (KME-See PE 0303140F, Project 67523, AF KME for a full description).  This AF effort supports an integrated effort across the cyber domain to transform to next-generation cryptographic capabilities.  It provides U.S. forces and multinational and interagency partners the multi-domain security needed to protect the flow and exchange of strategic, operational, and tactical information in accordance with national and international policy/standards, and the validated requirements of decision makers, warfighters, and the intelligence community.  

The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort is a collection of projects accomplished in three phases: replacement, modernization, and transformation. The replacement phase of the program focused on updating and/or replacing out-of-date algorithms along with unsustainable cryptographic products. The modernization phase provides crypto devices with common solutions that are more robust, modular, scalable, and provide the durability to existing cryptographic end items, as well as updating mid-term aging/unsupportable crypto equipment. Manpower and logistics requirements will be reduced and manpower efficiencies gained, while incremental capability enhancements and footprint reduction are provided. The third phase of the Cryptographic Modernization Program, transformation, provides common joint solutions which enable secure, transparent, multi-domain, network-centric capabilities. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning/execution and future program planning. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Implement AF portion of the DoD's Cryptographic Modernization (CM) Initiative through modernization/modification efforts, in varying stages of the acquisition cycle, with focus on minimizing life cycle costs. The CM portfolio of component acquisition projects is executing using a variety of approaches that vary from an evolutionary acquisition strategy using spiral development (for new component development) to incremental improvement leveraging leading-edge, certified non-developmental items (for modernization). Contract type is selected for each of the individual projects based upon its acquisition approach and its unique technology risks. A mixture of fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts have been selected which maximize the best value for the Government.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Key Management Enterprise (AF KME) Program consists of multiple developments supporting the AF requirements/portion of the DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) at the Tier 3 level. The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agent for the DoD KMI Program. AF KMI, in concert with this overarching DoD KMI Program, will provide a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material and other communications security (COMSEC) materials for all DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems and for the Services' weapon systems. KMI represents a broad-scale replacement of the current Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI will provide capabilities that will allow networked operation in consonance with the AF Information Network and other DoD, fellow Service, and AF enterprise objectives. It thereby will assure a viable support infrastructure for future weapons and C4I programs to incorporate key management into their system designs.

The DoD KMI will greatly improve protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy EKMS. KMI will greatly accelerate the availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission versus shipping of materials, will enhance mission responsiveness and flexibility, and will eventually take the man "out-of-the-loop" in the distribution of crypto key materials.

The AF KMI Program in concert with the DoD KMI Program is transitioning the Air Force from the legacy EKMS to modern DoD KMI and building the AF KME Tier 3 architecture. This Research and Development effort includes system engineering, development and testing to successfully implement the AF KMI Last Mile architecture as part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME) Tier 3. The AF KME Tier 3 is a holistic solution integrating the legacy and new and evolving cryptographic programs, materials, products, sources and consumers. The AF KME Tier 3 capabilities include as part of the AF KME distribution, management, and loading of cryptographic materials from the KMI (COMSEC account) to the end cryptographic unit (ECU). It builds the linkage interfaces that will allow KMI systems to communicate and integrate other related developments to meet operational needs. AF KME Tier 3 is currently in the Development Phase. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

In parallel with AF KMI, DoD and the Services are addressing the need for a new generation of future KMI-aware ECUs that will be capable of direct interaction with the DoD KMI Enterprise, under the Joint Crypto Modernization Initiative  (PE0303140F, BPAC 675100, Cryptographic Modernization, supports this initiative).  In some cases these new ECUs, although needing to be supported by KMI, will not be KMI network-connected. "Last mile" transport of black (aka benign, or encrypted) and red (unencrypted) keying material from a KMI client to a new generation ECU or current legacy ECU will need to be handled in the early years by one of two data transfer devices. Development of these two data transfer devices is supported by the Air Force Key Management Enterprise Tier 3 Program.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI) is a Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to standardize force structure data, making it visible, accessible, and understandable across the Department of Defense (DoD). This initiative is accomplished through each service's Organizational Server. The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) consumes data from various Air Force Authoritative Data Sources (ADSs), validates it, formats it in a consistent force structure data standard, and publishes it for consumption by programs of record that use force structure data. The AFOS is the ADS for Air Force Authorized Force Structure and provides critical unit, billet, crew platform, vehicle, and command relationship data within the Air Force to the Joint Staff (J8) for war and contingency planning, by providing visibility of the entire force structure as a function of time: past, present and future.

The AFOS produces consistent force structure data in the Global Force Management Information Exchange Model format that is well defined, centrally managed, and inter-operable as a standardized representation of the organization's hierarchy in all other programs of record that use force structure data. The end goal of the GFM-DI AFOS is to integrate the four force management processes (Assignment, Manpower &amp; Personnel, Readiness, and Allocation), and ensure the data is available to meet the needs of all users, systems and functions.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the GFM-DI system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program will utilize an evolutionary acquisition strategy resulting in the migration to a Joint Information Environment (JIE)-compliant platform, replacement of system Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) components with newer, more capable elements, and additional software releases to implement additional requirements. 

The anticipated contract structure will be Firm-Fixed Price contract.

The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) PMO will utilize a mix of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Interface Requirement Agreements with AFOS stakeholders and support agencies as part of its management strategy. SLAs will be developed with the Lead Developmental Test Organization and the Capabilities Integration Environment at Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex. The AFOS PMO also maintains Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) with several AFOS input and output systems, including Manpower Programming &amp; Execution Systems,  Air Force Directory Services, Air Force Equipment Management System, and Force Structure Data Management.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY21, PE 0304115, Multi Domain Command and Control RDT&amp;E funds were transferred to PE 0604003F BA 04, (BPAC 640141) Advanced Battle Management System in order to provide consolidation of multi domain efforts and to provide greater clarity and transparency.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) portfolio develops the digital infrastructure and tools required for the joint force to provide operationally relevant and fieldable capabilities in support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS). ABMS addresses gaps in interoperability and information sharing for air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace domains. The ABMS lines of effort accelerate the development, integration, transition, and fielding of technologies that enable Joint All-Domain Command and Control.

ABMS investments are divided into seven categories of activities.

Digital Architectures, Standards, and Concept Development: This includes digital engineering and analysis, model-based systems engineering, and related analyses and exploration in support of potential investments in the other six categories.

Sensor Integration: This includes the development, test, and integration of open architecture sensor system. These systems will be based on government-owned standards and provide open and reusable capabilities, initially focused on air and ground moving target indication (AMTI, GMTI).

Multi-Domain Data Management: This includes cloud-based data libraries, data feeds, data wrappers, and data management to improve data discoverability and information sharing across the joint force. 

Multi-Domain Secure Processing: This includes hardware and software for multi-level security as well as edge hardware to enable a full range of military operations.

Multi-Domain Connectivity: This includes maturation and integration of open software-defined radios and networks, government-owned waveform libraries, and wideband multi-function RF systems. This category also includes the integration and standards required to leverage advances in commercial technology such as 5G networks and proliferated low-earth orbit satellite communications. 

Multi-Domain Applications: This includes cloud-based applications to process sensor data, fuse sensor data from multiple platforms across different domains, combine data into a common multi-domain operating picture, and provide battle management, command, and control (BMC2) functionality.

Effects Integration: This includes development and integration of open smart munitions that enable dynamic kill webs, attritable aircraft that generate combat mass and distributed effects, and real-time updates to mission data files to improve electronic warfare system performance. 

The ABMS approach is not a traditional systems acquisition. Instead of acquisition of platforms, ABMS is moving to acquisition of capabilities that are open, available, deployable, and reconfigurable for installation on or use by multiple systems across multiple domains. These capabilities increase the effectiveness and survivability of Air Force, joint, and coalition partners across permissive and contested environments, in all warfighting domains, and at multiple classification levels. ABMS will leverage existing and emerging technology with emphasis on commercial technology and those at technology readiness levels that will enable rapid transition. The innovations from ABMS will augment new and ongoing initiatives aligned with service multi-domain operational priorities. 

ABMS funding provides for operational concept development and demonstration, hardware development and integration, and software development and integration. The funding will also enable the limited transition of mature and ready capabilities to appropriate programs of record in synchronization with planned modernization activities. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JADC2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in additional to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.


This is not a new start.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>ABMS leverages and complements ongoing efforts and emerging technologies across services, agencies, laboratories, and industry partners. The hardware development approach is based on continuous integration and delivery of incremental capability improvement over time, with emphasis on open and modular systems that can be rapidly transitioned and widely deployed. Software will be deployed using a development/security/operations (DevSecOps) approach with multiple partners. Key points of emphasis include open and reusable software, cloud deployments for scaling and data management, and cyber resiliency. The DevSecOps approach directed by DoD facilitates integration efforts by traditional and non-traditional software providers, with or without prime contractor involvement.

ABMS executes onramp events with a COCOM sponsor every four months. These events show proposed technical solutions across the ABMS product lines, demonstrate capabilities being developed in an operationally-relevant scenario, and have the potential to generate leave-behind capabilities if requested. The participating platforms and COCOMs will vary from event to event. Capabilities developed in the ABMS portfolio will be presented at onramp events as they become ready for demonstration, with multiple capabilities being demonstrated at each event. Each event informs the next development sprint as well as future events while also reducing technology risk. This approach also facilitates rapid integration by making the technology visible and performing initial operationally-relevant testing for a broad COCOM audience. Specific event costs are contained in the JADC2 PE 3040115F (BPAC 673380), formerly known as MDC2, while development costs are contained in the ABMS PE.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project 675185, (COMPASS BRIGHT), changed from (Non-Traditional SIGINT (NTS))
FY19: COMPASS BRIGHT projects zeroed out to support higher Air Force priorities with payback in FY20 &amp; FY21</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds multi-domain, multi-Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts in support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), as applied by the Air Force in the Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan.  Specifically, Program Element (PE) 0304260F provides authorized and appropriated funding to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) RDT&amp;E efforts for utilization on airborne platforms.
 
According to the 2018 NDS, we are facing an increasingly complex security environment with adversaries in every operating domain and we need to ensure operations while under persistent multi-domain attack.  The future ISR portfolio will consist of multi-domain, multi-intelligence systems and remain confident across the entire conflict spectrum.  The Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) PE is integral to developing the SIGINT component of the multi-domain, multi-ISR system capable of maintaining the warfighter's decisive advantage through all ranges of military operations, to include the highly contested environments (HCE).

ASE Program funds are distributed to projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).  The SCWG is chartered to guide the ASE capability investment.  When required, the USAF may move funds between ASE projects, developing the highest priority projects in response to urgent (e.g., JUON) and emerging (e.g., JEON) warfighter needs.

The ASE Program participates in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of International and Air Force standards (e.g., North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) standardization) to ensure Joint, Allied, and Coalition interoperability with ASE fielded systems.  ASE funds lead the modernization efforts including existing airborne platform sensors, and where appropriate, their interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS).  Summarizing, the ASE Program approach is a synergistic development effort providing Air Force-wide ISR capabilities consistent with the NDS.  

ASE will use the Air Force SIGINT Architecture (AFSA) for planning and decision-making.  AFSA is focused on employing open architecture standards whenever possible, to allow maximum effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility of development upgrades with multi-domain interoperability.  That is, the ASE primary goal is to produce an open system architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF.

Funds in any project may be utilized to cover activities to include studies and analysis activities, supporting both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components. Through extensive utilization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based solutions to field needed capabilities, it also incurs a need for continuous identification of suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and integration efforts consistent with the COTS technology cycle.  These efforts provide required engineering for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations integrated into the various baseline modifications.  These funds will be disbursed among the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL programs.  Funding reflects the SCWG priorities and the accomplishment of other Airborne SIGINT Enterprise initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Development project supports airborne SIGINT design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering (NRE), program management, and other efforts associated with support to the fielded Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) and the development of follow-on SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components.  The Common Development project also supports the development and integration of new sensor capabilities, quick reaction capabilities, and replacement components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).
  
Development supports the ASIP system and follow-on SIGINT sensors to include Global High-altitude Open-system Sensor Technology (GHOST).  The ASIP sensor provides a common SIGINT system, allowing for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system.  The GHOST sensor is being developed as a platform agnostic SIGINT sensor to replace ASIP through the use of rapid acquisition strategies, implementation of open architecture concepts, and rapid integration of new signals of interests.  GHOST will be designed to address the NDS and Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan identified needs for multi-ISR systems in order to sustain SIGINT operations in a highly contested environment.

This project also supports overarching Airborne SIGINT Enterprise Program common development to include, but not limited to, the Air Force SIGINT Architecture maintenance, SIGINT modeling and simulation efforts, and technology development and risk reduction through the Air Force Research Lab managed Open Architecture Technology Lab (OATL).  Capability improvements needed to exploit service identified signals of interest will be identified as priorities by the Air Force SCWG.  This project provides the warfighter increased SIGINT combat capability via rapid acquisition.  Capability enhancements are implemented as soon as the ASE technology achieves satisfactory risk levels.  ASE developed Sensors will be integrated and tested on available platforms, funding permitting.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>SIGINT capabilities will be developed and integrated onto various platforms using an evolutionary acquisition approach to field incremental capability improvements, leveraging the OATL to incorporate platform agnostic, open system architecture. Requirements as validated and prioritized by the SCWG, will be executed through acquisition strategies employing maximum use of Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) authorities to include Section 804 rapid prototyping. The GHOST System will evolve rapidly starting with demonstrations of open architecture compliance on representative prototype hardware in the OATL before successively progressing to a testing program of a flyable prototype system and eventually production system. Such capabilities will be acquired and delivered by contracting with the appropriate vendor(s) while encouraging competition where possible and leveraging any existing USG capabilities that have already been developed.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The COMPASS BRIGHT program develops, demonstrates, and rapidly transitions advanced Air Force specific SIGINT capabilities against emerging and future target signals of interest.  This program pursues SIGINT technologies for program transition, to include Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Audio, Analytics, Special Signals of Interest, and Radio Frequency Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT).  The COMPASS BRIGHT program objective is to mature technologies for application in SIGINT and MASINT systems or subsystems. Production and integration of these developed technologies will be conducted by the appropriate programs. COMPASS BRIGHT projects are selected through a data call process, whereby the USAF evaluates proposals from the laboratories, platforms, and other government agencies, to select those projects that are most promising.

Operational Reconnaissance (Ops Recce) is part of the initiative to improve overall USAF intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability through development and use of sensor data from non-traditional ISR platforms and innovative use of sensors.  This program pursues Ops Recce capabilities for transition through development, testing, demonstration and implementation efforts across all platforms.  The Ops Recce program objective is to provide increased battlespace awareness through the use of sensors/platforms to achieve effects beyond what those sensor/platforms were originally designed.   

The program office authority extends to accomplishment of out-of-cycle COMPASS BRIGHT efforts.  These tasks may be filtered through the SIGINT Capability Working Group (SCWG) outside the normal vetting process to expedite acquisition of high-end capabilities for the warfighter.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To preserve Air Force and DoD military advantage from commercial and economic risk, the Office of Commercial Economic Analysis (OCEA) produces in-depth analytical assessments and advanced risk mitigation strategies based on commercially available industry, market, and economic information.  These assessments and strategies support the decision making efforts of Service, Department of Defense, and Whole of Government to protect National Security Innovation Base equities and sustain the U.S. competitive advantage.  

The funding request provides for an enterprise analytic platform providing a technical prototype which will aggregate risk data and produce mitigation strategies and impact analytic products, i.e. mature big data architecture, higher domain connectivity, continuous assessment capability and integrate external applications.  The funding also supports continuous assessment of the commercially available information to ensure it is accurate, current, and relevant.

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2021, PE 0305015F, C2 Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS), Project 675218, Applications Development, was transferred to PE 0207438F, Theater Battle Management (TBM) C4I, Project 675218, Applications Development, in order to improve transparency of development program.

In FY 2021, Project 675220, Unit Level, initial capability development efforts for Command and Control Incident Management and Emergency Response Application (C2IMERA; formerly Unit Command and Control [UC2]) is completed; new user requirements are being scoped and may result in future project restart.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Command and Control (C2) Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) funds operational development necessary to acquire and modify segments of Air Force's (AF) C2 capabilities and services. Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies. These efforts focus on support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other AF and Joint Services C2 systems. Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013). These activities include C2AOS-C2IS needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012).

Applications Development: C2AOS-C2IS creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest. C2AOS-C2IS also develops and matures net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions. These applications include Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); the remainder of the CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems - Force Level (TBMCS FL) functionality; services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a JC2 Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.

Unit Level: Command and Control Incident Management and Emergency Response Application (C2IMERA; formerly Unit Command and Control [UC2]) funds develop and integrate C2IMERA as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support a wing commander's ability to track base level resources, incident management, and provide a real time Common Operating Picture, enabling a commander to have total situational awareness during peace and wartime operations. C2IMERA operations software systems addresses needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline System Requirements Document (SRD), and AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, requirements documents. C2IMERA is utilizing Agile Software Development and Operations (DevOps) methodology by directly soliciting user feedback for improvements to the software. C2IMERA is fielded to Wing Operations Centers (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Centers (MOC), the Emergency Operations Centers (EOC), Crisis Action Teams (CAT), and many other work-centers across multiple MAJCOMs with plans to expand for use as an AF wide application.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Applications Development and Unit Level weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies. These efforts focus on support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other AF and Joint Services C2 systems. Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013). These activities include C2 Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012). C2AOS-C2IS creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest. C2AOS-C2IS also develops and matures net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions. These applications include Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); the remainder of the CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems - Force Level (TBMCS FL) functionality; services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a JC2 Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.
 
No FY 2021 funding requested; FY 2021 project efforts are detailed in PE 0207438F, Theater Battle Management (TBM) C4I.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Applications Development weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Command and Control Incident Management and Emergency Response Application (C2IMERA; formerly Unit Command and Control [UC2]) funds are used to develop and integrate C2IMERA as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support a wing commander's ability to track base level resources, incident management, and a real time Common Operating Picture, enabling a commander to have total situational awareness during peace and wartime operations. C2IMERA operations software systems addresses needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline System Requirements Document (SRD), and AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, requirements documents. C2IMERA is utilizing Agile DevOps methodology by directly soliciting user feedback for improvements to the software. C2IMERA is fielded to Wing Operations Centers (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Centers (MOC), the Emergency Operations Centers (EOC), Crisis Action Teams (CAT), and many other work-centers across multiple MAJCOMs with plans to expand for use as an AF wide application.

In FY 2021, no funding is requested for Unit Level as initial capability development efforts for C2IMERA development is completed; new user requirements are being scoped and may result in future project restart.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Unit Level weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Combatant Commands (CCMDs) require a cohesive, flexible Information Technology (IT) enterprise to ensure intelligence content informs analysis, planning, warfighter operations, and strategic decision making. The Combatant Command Intelligence Enterprise Management Support Office (CCI EMSO) is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community (IC) users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. 

OUSD(I) and Joint Staff sponsored a capabilities based assessment resulting in an Intelligence System Initial Capability Document (IS-ICD - JROCM 094-16) and a Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Logistics, Policy, Facility (DOTMLPF) Change Request (DCR - JROCM 088-17).  In response OUSD(I) coordinated with the Air Force to create the CCI EMSO, formerly Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology Provisional Program Activity Office (CCIIT PPAO). CCI EMSO is tasked to address these gap areas for the CCMDs.  Budget line enables long term research and evaluation of systems and processes capable of supporting the CCI Enterprise.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Combatant Commands (CCMDs) require a cohesive, flexible Information Technology (IT) enterprise to ensure intelligence content informs analysis, planning, warfighter operations, and strategic decision making. Currently, the Combatant Command Intelligence Enterprise Management Support Office (CCI EMSO) is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community (IC) users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. 

OUSD(I) and Joint Staff sponsored a Capabilities Based Assessment resulting in an Intelligence System Initial Capability Document (IS-ICD - JROCM 094-16).  In response OUSD(I) coordinated with the Air Force to create the CCI EMSO, formerly Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology Provisional Program Activity Office (CCIIT PPAO). CCI EMSO is tasked to address these gap areas for the CCMDs.  Budget line enables long term research and evaluation of systems and processes capable of supporting the CCI Enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

(U//FOUO) Algorithmic Warfare encompasses efforts to develop, employ, or field artificial intelligence, automation, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms. This critical shift to the digital age will transition ISR analysis from the "what" to the "why" of analysis via human-machine teaming. Algorithmic Warfare can provide world-class ISR support to Joint Operations at the scale and speed required in modern warfare against our adversaries. 

(U//FOUO) Algorithmic Warfare reshapes current sense, identify, attribute, share (SIAS, previously known as PED - processing, exploitation, and dissemination) models because the current models will be unsustainable and ineffective in developing ISR digital solutions to find efficiencies and thrive in a complex operating environment. This funding is a first step to address ISR analysts' struggles with data overload; they currently spend 80 percent of their time searching for data and 20 percent of their time making sense of the information. 

(U) Supports National Defense Strategy priority of operating at the "speed of relevance."

(U) Supports Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element funds the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Aerospace Management Systems Division (AMSD), the designated Air Force (AF) Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Navigation Safety Center of Excellence (COE). The COE conducts highly specialized analysis, assessment and performance monitoring of military and civil CNS/ATM capabilities and ensures manned and unmanned aircraft system conformance to national and international civil aviation standards allowing safe and efficient access to global airspace. COE expertise is provided to Headquarters Air Force, AF Major Commands (MAJCOM), and weapon system program offices. This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 30 AF weapon system program offices with resident CNS/ATM technical expertise. 

This funding enables the COE to monitor and participate in government and industry technical forums and U.S. and International civil aviation standards bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) and others. These organizations are responsible for the development and assessment of international civil aviation standards for safe and efficient flight operations in worldwide airspace. COE personnel analyze civil aviation standards as they are being developed and work to influence them to support Department of Defense (DoD) interests.   

Specific technical and engineering criteria established by U.S. and International civil aviation standards are documented in generic performance matrices (GPMs).  The COE works with MAJCOM and program office personnel and develops strategies to implement CNS/ATM capability requirements on AF weapon systems and tailor the GPMs to each platform's unique avionics architecture and operational mission.  After completion of CNS/ATM component integration and testing, COE personnel validate platform performance against the aviation standards necessary for the platform to operate safely and efficiently in worldwide airspace. This performance assessment is submitted to the aircraft program office and becomes part of their Airworthiness certification package.    

The COE provides technical analysis and assessments of CNS/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment throughout the lifecycle of manned and unmanned aircraft platforms.  Efforts include and are not limited to performance assessment, test support, performance monitoring, interoperability testing, cybersecurity assessments, and the development and assessment of CNS/ATM capabilities for unmanned platforms.  Unmanned platform support includes, and is not limited to location-specific Ground Based Detect and Avoid (GBDAA) radar and airspace characterization, and evaluation of emerging unmanned aircraft system technologies.

The COE administers and manages multiple contracts including the electronic Global Air Traffic Management (iGATM) catalog to enable centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment, navigation data, and technical engineering services for aircraft platform program offices and other mission partners. Technical engineering services may include and are not limited to performance monitoring, interoperability testing, cybersecurity assessments, and the development and assessment of CNS/ATM capabilities for emerging unmanned platform technologies such as location-specific GBDAA characterization. The iGATM catalog may also offer hardware, software, risk kits, operations and training materials, and the installation and check-out of GBDAA and other emerging unmanned see and avoid technologies and systems. These contracts are used by aircraft program offices across the DoD, among other federal agencies, and in support of foreign military sales.

The Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) electronic navigation database is developed and maintained by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) and contains critical safety of flight information used by all DoD flight crews to fly Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) procedures, safely navigate airways and fly Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs) to civil and military airfields worldwide.  The COE performs periodic and event driven audits of NGA and alternate industry navigation source data providers and navigation data software tools required by civil aviation authorities.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CNS/ATM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, sustain, and modernize Air Force Weather Service (AFWS) capabilities in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) lines of effort.  To improve readiness for a more lethal force, AFWS provides timely, accurate, resilient, and relevant environmental information, to include space environment and terrestrial weather, for global battlespace situational awareness for Air Force (AF), Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), combatant commands, the intelligence community, and other government agencies.  AFWS capabilities at home station and deployed provide critical support to the full spectrum of air and space combat operations.  AFWS decreases the risk to mission and risk to force by increasing the lethality, effectiveness, and survivability of DoD weapon systems.  The AF Weather Enterprise Cloud migration effort modernizes key capabilities providing the military advantage to accurately predict environmental impacts optimizing mission planning ,targeting, weaponeering, mission execution, battle damage assessment, and space systems operations.   To strengthen alliances and partnerships, AFWS development efforts integrate DoD, government agency, commercial, and international partner environmental data with AFWS information system equipment for processing, storing, exploiting, and disseminating multi-domain weather information for analysis, forecasting, mission integration, and greater interoperability. Funding for AFWS development ensures greater performance and affordability through improvements to architecture and system efficiency, cybersecurity, joint all-domain command and control (JADC2)/advanced battle management system (ABMS)/sensing grid integration, migration to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) initiatives, and expanding agile software development, delivery, and integration practices.  

AFWS aligns activities under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications (PTWA).  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions. Of these four capability areas, two (Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination and Weather Forecasting) are addressed by APPN 3600, BA 07, PE 0305111F, Project 672738 - Weather Service. In FY2021, a portion of the APPN 3600 funding and activities from Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination and Weather Forecasting will begin to migrate to the PTWA capability area to better address development of applications, software, C2 systems, and web interfaces that directly impact the warfighter.
 
1. Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides cloud-computing-based Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration (CD/CI) for software development and deployment; command and control and mission planning integration; centralized, cybersecure weather web service capability; large-scale data ingest, processing, and warfighter product generation and visualization; global, regional, and mission execution forecasts; specific, mission-tailored weather data on demand; and weapon system interoperability which shortens the Combatant Commander kill chain through machine to machine interfaces.  The Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination capability area includes activities for Weather Data Analysis Increment 4 (WDA Inc-4) and its follow-on increment, Weather Data Analysis Increment 5 (WDA Inc-5). WDA Inc-4 was previously referred to as WDA.

2. Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high-resolution forecast products for mission planning, rehearsal, and execution with an emphasis on clouds, theater scale weather, aerosol/chemical constituents, and space environment characterization. Weather Forecasting includes activities for Numerical Weather Modeling (NWM); Weather Services - Live, Virtual, Constructive (WS-LVC), and Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Weather Service weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

Activities include research and analysis to support current program planning. Management Service costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) and Advisory and Assistance Service (A&amp;AS).

This requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, SEC 240-D.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>SWAFS is a software suite of 47 models/applications to ingest, process, and store space environmental data, run space environmental models to specify and forecast the near-Earth environment, and run space effects characterization applications.  SWAFS products support various operations including 1. Spacecraft tracking and health 2. Early Warning &amp; Theater Warning Radar support 3. GPS &amp; SATCOM user support 4. Intel Community support and 5. High Altitude &amp; Space Flight support.  SWAFS's current main thrusts include modernizing SWAFS software code and transitioning SWAFS code to the cloud which will enable construction of a service-based architecture and enhance cycle times and the overall user experience. Furthermore, the program is working to deliver the Magnetospheric Energetic Charged Particle Hazard Assessment System (ECP HAS) that is designed to inform satellite operators of hazards and the impacts to their spacecraft and will provide the warfighter with the environmental awareness to safely sustain their respective orbits and missions.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AF Weather is adopting a CD/CI approach to delivering capabilities rapidly and routinely using multiple contracts to support a family of ACAT III Programs of Record through development fielding and sustainment. 

Cost Plus contracts are utilized for software development and sustainment and Fixed Firm Price contracts for COTS systems and Contract Logistics Support (CLS) efforts. Pre-competed GSA and Defense MicroElectronics Activity (DMEA) contract vehicles are leveraged when appropriate, and competitive and small-business awards are favored.

The Air Force Program Executive Officer for Digital (AFPEO Digital) and the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Space (AFPEO SP) are the PEOs for the AFWS. AFPEO Digital manages the ground-based atmospheric sensing and data analysis, atmospheric forecast systems, and PTWA. AFPEO SP manages the ground-based segments of space environment collection platforms as well as SWAFS. Both the AFPEO Digital and AFPEO SP are their respective program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), unless delegated.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development, and management of new air traffic control communications, surveillance, automation, positioning, and precision approach and landing systems. When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ATCALS development funding currently focuses on Air Traffic Control (ATC) Future Technology (formerly referred to as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System {NextGen ATS}).  The program name was changed to more accurately reflect the scope of the effort which includes military and civil capabilities/requirements. In order to enable safe and efficient military flight operations in a changing global airspace, the ATC Future technology effort is designed to identify the warfighter's emerging airspace needs, analyze technologies, formulate requirements and positions, and advise DoD aviation and air traffic communities.

ATCALS ATC Future Technology supports the 2018 National Defense strategic approach to "generate decisive and sustained U.S. military advantages" by enabling "forward force maneuver and posture resilience" through the research and development of technology and strategies that support adaptive, agile basing concepts of operations while providing ATCALS capabilities necessary to ensure enduring, resilient, efficient and safe air operations.  ATC Future Technology will "evolve innovative operational concepts" by modernizing airfield operations and providing adaptive ATC services and systems appropriate for the current environment, which will bolster "Dynamic Force Employment" through scalable employment operations and globally deployable forces for the four layers of the "Global Operating Model: "contact, blunt, surge, and homeland". 

FY21 efforts will continue to research and develop new technologies in the areas of aircraft launch and recovery for both fixed and expeditionary operations; military and civil airspace interoperability; optimization of flight operations; Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) access to civil airspace; ATC training study; DoD/AF or civil US and international mandates (e.g., Mode-5); improved Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) software capabilities; conduct of service operational test and evaluations as required; mitigation of windfarm interference (e.g., with Infill Radars);  technology and evaluation of new civil air traffic control and landing system technologies that may have military utility to include an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Tower System technology, mobile TACAN antenna technology, and expeditionary technology development and prototyping. As these technologies and architectures mature, fixed base and deployable ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with related aircraft avionics capabilities that may be required (manned and unmanned).  ATC Future Technology analysis and recommendations will be captured in program charters and incorporated into the ATC Future Technology Strategic Roadmap.  When implemented, these efforts will enable DoD aircraft to take advantage of new technologies and operational capabilities, to enhance safety, security, efficiency, affordability, and flight operations.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the ATCALS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets assure warfighters' weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production. Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, and other aircraft. Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full-scale Aerial Target, BQM-167A Subscale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized Target Payload Subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Enables analysis, development and prototyping of threat emulations/simulations, and presentation of evolving threat scenarios and target area environments to prepare for emerging weapons development activities. Development is required to evolve aerial targets and target control capabilities to meet current and future threats. Air Force is the Executive Agent for Full-scale Aerial Targets.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Full-scale Aerial Targets, Subscale Aerial Targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets, Subscale Aerial Targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) assure the effectiveness and currency of warfighter weapon systems to combat real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  The BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) is a reusable jet-powered target aircraft measuring approximately 20 feet long with a mission to simulate threat aircraft for testing and evaluation of surface-to-air, ship-to-air, or air-to-air missiles.  The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared (IR) devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of overall performance enhancement efforts to meet evolving threats. Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include, but not limited to: missile scoring, Electronic Attack (EA) and IR countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. 

EA payload upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscale and full-scale targets to realistically emulate current and emerging foreign threat systems in support of weapons testing.  

TCS provides a myriad of sub-systems that, together, deliver the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full-scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, and the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service T&amp;E demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Full-scale Aerial Targets, Subscale Aerial Targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This BPAC is an administrative continuation of BPAC 675366: QF-16, and encompasses the same efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets ensure warfighters' weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15 aircraft, and other aircraft. Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Full-scale Aerial Targets, Subscale Aerial Targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets ensure warfighters' weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15 and other aircraft.  Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Full-scale Aerial Targets, Subscale Aerial Targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) conducts specialized investigative activities and force protection support for Air Force (AF) commanders worldwide. This assists AF commanders in protecting their people and resources. AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal matters affecting AF personnel, contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts, the investigation of environmental crime, counterdrugs, computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM), Computer Crime Investigations (CCI), and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations
for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information. The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems. Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute
those who do. While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology. The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD.
In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems. Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical
countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions. The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>These funds will support development of a suite of specialized law enforcement and counterintelligence restricted tools needed to exploit cyberspace, digital media storage and mobile audio/visual/data communications for the collection of evidence against a wide variety of serious offenses.  They will develop next generation Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) to defend against emerging foreign technical intelligence capabilities targeting sensitive protected information for exploitation.  The concerted efforts of criminal, terrorist and foreign intelligence elements to evade law enforcement and compromise protected systems, all while remaining undetected using the latest technical advances available, require persistent development of tools to defeat their efforts.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market Research is accomplished jointly within the DoD, Counterintelligence, and Law Enforcement communities with the various government laboratories and major  contractors to identify locations with the ability to develop investigative tools unique to our mission needs. These technologies, capabilities, and limitations of current and future investigative tools is sometimes highly sensitive or classified. Market Research also allows inter-agency coordination and deconfliction to occur,
reducing or eliminating duplicitous development efforts. Annually, stakeholders meet to discuss initiatives, challenges and organizational goals to coordinate or consolidate requirements to increase efficiency. Once Market Research and any applicable coordination/deconfliction is completed, acquisition channels are analyzed and selected based on the ability to meet operational and technical security requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The OC-135B aircraft supports the implementation of the United States Government (USG) Open Skies Treaty. This program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15).  The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. The aircraft can use optical cameras, video cameras, sideways-looking synthetic aperture radar, and infrared line scanning devices.  There are 34 participating states to the Open Skies Treaty.  The Air Force is required to allow over flight of USAF bases per multilateral request; to acquire, operate, and maintain the aircraft and equipment utilized during over flights of partner countries; to provide required sensor media and initial media processing; and to provide airfield servicing, logistics, and maintenance for foreign over flights of the US.

In October 2016, the Air Force used a multi-disciplinary High Performance Team to create and validate a series of required capabilities for an Open Skies aircraft, evaluate aircraft that could satisfy the required capabilities, and then consider each of the Doctrine, Organization, Training, materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy elements as part of a recommended solution. The effort accomplished two main purposes. First, it updated operational requirement and replaced the 1992 Operational Requirements Document to reflect both operational experience and expected Open Skies program needs for the foreseeable future. Second, it recommended an Air Force solution that best satisfied required capabilities within existing materiel solutions. The Joint Capabilities Board adopted the Air Force recommendation and directed acquisition of two small airliner class aircraft for the Open Skies Treaty mission to be acquired in a method consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and other applicable guidance, training using existing contractor training facilities, equipment, and curriculum, and a maintenance concept with military personnel performing unit-level maintenance actions with contractor support for parts supply, and supply chain management, performed under a Low Utilization Maintenance Program.

This effort includes the design, development, and test activities for two OC-135B replacement weapon systems. This effort will modify a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified, commercial-off-the-shelf, small airliner class aircraft. System Development requires structural design, interphone communications systems, flight deck avionics  and modification to incorporate the Digital Visual Imaging System (DVIS) system.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver OSTAR weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

The FY2021 funding request was reduced by $76.2 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Open Skies Treaty permits unarmed overflight of the sovereign territory of 34 signatory nations. The Treaty enhances mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information through aerial imaging on military forces and activities of concern. Open Skies is one of the most wide-ranging international arms control efforts to date to promote openness and transparency in military forces and activities.

The Department of Defense is responsible for oversight, implementation of, and compliance with, arms control agreements, including the Open Skies Treaty. The United States Air Force has a requirement to execute missions under the Open Skies Treaty and utilizes two OC-135B aircraft as the observation aircraft. All roles and responsibilities are called out in Presidential Policy Directive 15, "Implementation of the Treaty on Open Skies,” Mar 1, 2012. The OC-135B fleet has experienced decreasing mission reliability due to age, difficulties with out-of-production parts, and increasing operating costs.  Open Skies missions averaged a 65% mission completion rate over the ten-year period from 2007 to 2017 with leading non-mission capable drivers being the engines, fuel system, landing gear, generators, and airframe. Additionally, the OC-135B aircraft's 6,500 km range is insufficient to fully execute mission options within the 96-hour in-country Treaty observation time constraint permitted under Treaty.

The Department of Defense, motivated by operational limitations of the OC-135B experienced during Open Skies missions combined with declining mission capability, prompted program officials to request a Capabilities-Based Assessment in July 2015 to study aircraft issues. The effort which completed in June 2016 indicated that key requirements within the 1992 Open Skies Operational Requirements Document were no longer current, and that the OC-135B had known capability performance gaps in range and mission completion.

In October 2016, the Air Force used a multi-disciplinary High Performance Team to create and validate a series of required capabilities for an Open Skies aircraft, evaluate aircraft that could satisfy the required capabilities, and then consider each of the Doctrine, Organization, Training, materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy elements as part of a recommended solution. The effort accomplished two main purposes. First, it updated operational requirement and replaced the 1992 Operational Requirements Document to reflect both operational experience and expected Open Skies Treaty program needs for the foreseeable future. Second, it recommended an Air Force solution that best satisfied required capabilities within existing materiel solutions. The Joint Capabilities Board adopted the Air Force recommendation and directed acquisition of two small airliner class aircraft for the Open Skies Treaty Aircraft Recap (OSTAR) mission to be acquired in a method consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and other applicable guidance, training using existing contractor training facilities, equipment, and curriculum, and a maintenance concept with military personnel performing unit-level maintenance actions with contractor support for parts supply, and supply chain management, performed under a Low Utilization Maintenance Program.

This effort includes the design, development, and test activities for two OC-135B replacement weapon systems. This effort will modify a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified, commercial-off-the-shelf, small airliner class aircraft. System Development requires structural design, interphone communications systems, flight deck avionics  and modification to incorporate the Digital Visual Imaging System (DVIS).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver OSTAR weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OC-135B aircraft supports the implementation of the United States Government (USG) Open Skies Treaty. This program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15).  The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. The aircraft can use optical cameras, video cameras, sideways-looking synthetic aperture radar, and infrared line scanning devices.  There are 34 participating states to the Open Skies Treaty.  The Air Force is required to allow over flight of USAF bases per multilateral request; to acquire, operate, and maintain the aircraft and equipment utilized during over flights of partner countries; to provide required sensor media and initial media processing; and to provide airfield servicing, logistics, and maintenance for foreign over flights of the US.

Open Skies Sensors - Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras.  Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than FY14 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)" 

Test articles will be procured for the purpose of developmental testing and to support Treaty certification of the sensors.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver DVIS weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) develops future technologies capable of thwarting advanced, hostile force technical capabilities.  The technologies will provide secure environments for austere mission planning locations and theater commander centers, and will collect information for CI operations in support of DoD and AF requirements.

Cyber CI enables the Air Force Office of Special Investigations to detect and deter covert activities conducted by Foreign Intelligence Entities seeking to compromise classified or sensitive information in cyberspace. The technologies provided will provide state of the art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against sensitive and classified AF and DoD information and activities.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2020 Integrated Broadcast Services (IBS) efforts funded in PE1203179F in FY2018 and FY2019, transferred to PE0305179F due to realignment of IBS to Major Force Program 03, Intelligence and Communication.

The IBS fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination
of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force
protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.

IBS is comprised of the following:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF (Ultra High Frequency) satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a Military Standard (MIL-STD)
Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal
(JTT).
- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant
Commanders (COCOMs), all built to validated warfighter requirements.
-- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users.
-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast. Additionally, the TIN will
receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB.

This PE funds:
- Development/upgrades of IBS (IBS-NS, CIB, and CMF)
This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver IBS weapon system capability. The use of such program
funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FY21 3600 budget reflects database error, and incorrect total. In FY21, PE 0305206F, (Airborne Reconnaissance Systems), Project 672001, (Next Generation Sensor) received $18M in funds that were intended for PE 0305202F (Dragon U-2), Project 674820, (Sensor Development), per FY21 PBD &amp; PDM.  Upon initial distribution of funds, OSD and SAF/FM will coordinate for internal transfer of funds to the U-2 program to continue future and ongoing work for avionics and sensor efforts under PE 0305202F (Dragon U-2).”</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The U-2S Dragon Lady platform is a high-demand/low-density aircraft equipped with state-of-the-art sensor and data link systems providing mission essential Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) to the Combatant Commands, Joint and Combined forces, and the IC community in peacetime and wartime. The program supports core missions such as Sensitive Reconnaissance Operations (outlined in CJCSI 3250.01) in addition to other missions that include execution of CCMD OPLANs and CONPLANs, Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Response (HADR), Counter-Insurgency (COIN) operations and third-party treaty verification/monitoring via the OLIVE HARVEST mission.

Currently, the Air Force plans to divest the U-2 in FY25.  Until that time, in order to meet NDAA mandated capability and capacity, the Air Force continues to invest and modernize the U-2 program in the 2021 President's Budget.  These investments will address reliability, maintainability, supportability, diminishing manufacturing sources/ material shortages (DMS/MS), flight test, safety issues, and integration of capability development activities in support of the broader ISR portfolio.  This continued investment in the platform ends in FY25, where the U-2 will be divested. Until that time, RDT&amp;E efforts will address sustainment, modification, and modernization of sensors and associated mission equipment, and focus on integrating/expanding platform capabilities within the larger ISR portfolio; these efforts include (but are not limited to) ASARS 2B/C, avionics and navigation tech refresh, mission planning software and infrastructure upgrades, modernization of aircraft data links, next generation SIGINT, and developing a quick reaction capability (QRC), enabling improved collection against emerging threats and capabilities.

Additionally, the U-2 program will continue to prioritize emergent and/or experimental RDT&amp;E efforts designed to mitigate the rapidly evolving combat environment (e.g. electromagnetic requirements) in order to maintain safety and operational relevance through current and future U-2 operating locations.  

Currently, the U-2 Program provides funding for an Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) acquisition effort. This effort will design, fabricate, integrate, and demonstrate system capability enhancements for a high altitude deep look SAR system. This mitigates a Diminishing Manufacturing Supply and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issue with the current U-2 SAR sensor and processor.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project was an Air Force led technology and concept development to demonstrate the ability for a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to stay airborne in the medium altitude structure for a multiple day duration mission with a minimum of 1,000 pounds payload capacity of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensor systems.  The MAGIC concept was initiated by OSD/DDR&amp;E in FY 2010 in response to the Combatant Commanders ranking this type of initiative as the highest priority for a Joint Concept and Technology Demonstration (JCTD).  In FY 2011, the Air Force accepted this initiative as the sponsor and MAGIC was subsequently removed from consideration as a JCTD and transitioned into the Air Force as a developmental project.

The MAGIC project was intended to provide the USAF with data regarding sensor and aircraft performance parameters at a multiple day duration at medium altitude flight.  The objectives laid out in the JCTD competition and selection of Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA for the long endurance demonstration was managed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG).

In FY 2010, OSD/DDR&amp;E (now ASD/R&amp;E) provided $5M of initial funding to AFRL to initiate the MAGIC project.  In FY 2011, ASD/R&amp;E provided an additional $5M to keep the MAGIC project development moving forward.  The Air Force provided $10M of FY 2011. Congressional Adds of $19M in FY 2012, $50M in FY 2013 and $20M in FY 2015, provided the program manager with the funding for the continuation of the Orion RPA development and initiation of the three phase flight testing series. Congressional adds of $5M in FY 2016, $50M in FY 2017 and $40M in FY 2018, continues the Orion Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) spiral development of a long endurance UAS that meets airworthiness and cybersecurity requirements, and provides a minimum interoperability and mission capability.

Orion RPA flight test series and demonstrations were accomplished at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, CA between August 2013 and March 2015.  The objectives to test/demonstrate basic air vehicle performance, expansion of the flight characteristic envelope and a multiple day sortie and integration of a nominal sensor payload, were successfully accomplished on the prototype (Block 0) Orion RPA in a controlled environment, non-representative of an operational setting. Subsequent development efforts concentrated on the validation of the Orion RPA system requirements and concept design/specifications for a follow-on air vehicle (Block 1) capable of operational deployment in the event that the Air Force chooses the Orion RPA as a quick reaction capable system for a theater of operation or a program of record.  Currently, there is no validated requirement for the Orion RPA.

A Congressional Add of $15M in FY 2019 completed flight software development, air vehicle system and ground test and begins performance characterization flight test.

A Congressional Add of $15M in FY 2020 will continue performance characterization flight test and begin manufacturing of Air Vehicle 02.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Orion RPA capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>There is currently no validated requirement for the Orion RPA.  The concept for the Air Force to develop a long endurance, persistent ISR capability for the Combatant Commanders was an outgrowth of a JCTD started in FY 2010.  Previous development efforts included: completion of studies analysis, development of a prototype air vehicle (Block 0), bench testing of engines and other aircraft components, ground continuity testing of select avionics, flight controls, and engine components, slow and high speed ground taxiing and a full flight series testing of the Orion RPA capabilities to include a multiple day, long duration flight demonstration.  Starting with a portion of the FY 2015 funds, Congressional adds have continued hardware and software engineering and development efforts, while working towards operational airworthiness and cybersecurity standards, and mission requirements for a deployable air vehicle (Block 1).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds multi-domain, multi-Intelligence (multi-INT) research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts in support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and 2018 DoD Artificial Intelligence Strategy, as applied by the Air Force in the Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan.  Specifically, Program 0305206F provides authorized and appropriated funding to multi-INT RDT&amp;E efforts for utilization on airborne platforms. This program traditionally provides a venue for integration of technologies matured in both the Advanced Technology and Sensors(0604257F) and Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (0304260F) program elements.

According to the 2018 NDS, "we are facing an increasingly complex security environment as defined by ... adversaries in every operating domain.”  Additionally, to ensure (operations) sustainment while under persistent multi-domain attack, the Air Force has applied the NDS in the Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan.  The future ISR portfolio will "consist of a multi-domain, multi-intelligence,” systems to "remain confident across the entire conflict spectrum.”  The Airborne Reconnaissance PE is integral to developing multi-domain, multi-INT systems capable of sustaining warfighter decisive advantage through all ranges of military operations, up to highly contested environments (HCE).

The Airborne Reconnaissance System (ARS) Program matures, develops, demonstrates, and rapidly transitions: next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensors, and both active and passive capabilities.  ARS includes sensor data processing for multiple airborne platforms, in addition to sensor products aiding assisted target recognition algorithms and other artificial intelligence activities (e.g., geolocation models, sensor based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).  ARS provides for modeling &amp; simulation, training and multi-INT systems engineering. This program also coordinates common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real-time multi-domain ISR development.

The ARS Program includes the following efforts:  Next Generation Sensors efforts lead advancements in multi-INT, platform agnostic capability.  The Next Generation Sensors (NGS) project is developing, demonstrating, and maturing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor suites in a platform agnostic environment. Sensor suites will include open architectures to further enable platform mobility and tech refresh as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to enable assisted target detection and identification. Efforts include but are not limited to, Triple Raven multi-GEOINT High Altitude Advanced Technology Demonstration, multi-INT Common Open Architecture Reconnaissance Programs Standard (MI-COARPS), and Assisted Target Recognition for ISR (ATRI).  Agile ISR includes Detection Removal and Characterization Operations developing a robust image quality improvement capability for airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) products.  Sensors Open Systems Architecture (SOSA) coordinates advanced technologies, and open architecture development for multi-INT sensor modalities. The program includes development of a family of government owned, open, platform agnostic pods - the AgilePod Family. Sensor Development includes Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) front end antenna array and receiver exciter advancements (ASARS-2B) and back end processor advancements (ASARS-2C).  ASARS-2B follow on RDT&amp;E extends range, enhances Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) performance and introduces maritime capability while laying in the framework for future use of open architectures. ASARS-2C effort extends the functionality and performance of ASARS-2B through the addition of advanced radar capabilities by enabling use of third party vendor solutions and multi-platform integration.  ASARS is the radar solution for Next Generation Sensors efforts.  JTC supports ISR Training Systems Integration Laboratories.  Gorgon Stare Wide Area Motion Imagery research, development, test and evaluation.  Data Compression efforts are led by Reduction of Data Using Compression Enhancement (RDUCE).  RDUCE develops data compression algorithms, addressing current and future date dissemination systems' bandwidth limitations.  Consistent with NDS, algorithms are multi-INT sensor agnostic that are submitted for formal adoption by the DoD-Intelligence Community (IC) Joint Enterprise Standards Committee (JESC) GEOINT standards groups.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Next Generation Sensors (NGS) project is developing, demonstrating, and maturing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor suites in a platform agnostic environment.  Designated as a Middle Tier Acquisition, Section 804 effort, these sensor suites will include open architectures to further enable platform mobility and tech refresh as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to enable assisted target detection and identification.  Efforts include but are not limited to, Triple Raven multi-GEOINT High Altitude Advanced Technology Demonstration, multi-INT Common Open Architecture Reconnaissance Program Standard (MI-COARPS), Assisted Target Recognition for ISR (ATRI), and radar open architecture development in support of ASARS-2B/2C.

NGS program efforts are set by capabilities gaps within the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and as approved by the Capabilities Decision Memorandum (Signed Jan 2019). These requirements have been further verified, modeled, and developed through the Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and the Triple Raven ATD, which was approved by the Advanced Technology Council (ATC) in FY19. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Agile ISR BPAC matures, develops, and deploys projects started under the Imaging &amp; Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) program in support of current and future platform agnostic, non-proprietary, autonomous, multi-INT cross cueing ISR solutions based on Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) and Joint All-domain Command and Control (JADC2) mission requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, Detection Removal and Characterization Operations (DRACO), support and development of AgilePod, and other projects. Portions of the developmental efforts under Agile ISR are classified.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Sensors Open System Architecture (SOSA) project coordinates the advanced technologies open architecture development for modalities of sensors, such as: RADAR, SIGINT, EW, Communications and EO/IR (development of standards and open architecture interfaces for Software, Hardware, and Electrical/Mechanical interfaces) in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned. Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly upgrade/iterate advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for remotely piloted aircraft through development of abstraction interfaces for sense (such as RADAR, ADS-B, TCAS, Next Generation Sensors, ASIP, and ASARS) and avoid logic. 

This project also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The SOSA project also increases interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces, as well as leveraging industry participation toward creating COTS solutions such as common C4ISR processor, AgilePOD interfaces, Red/Black separation on the sensor, data at rest, and security/AT with industry partners and other DoD services. 

This project is designed to support development of the Next Generation Sensors program, as well as other AFLCMC/WI emerging and program of record needs. As part of the development effort SOSA will be funding and supporting first article development of key open architecture solutions to validate/verify open specifications as well as to prime the COTS vendors development strategies. The SOSA effort has stood up AFLCMC SIL (System Integration Laboratory) for Sensors Open System Architectures in order to establish a strong conformance/compliance program with industry partners for COTS products, in partnership with other DoD services.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The I&amp;TS purpose is to develop, mature, demonstrate, and rapidly transition next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (active and passive systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).

Developmental efforts pursued include but are not limited to: Radar, Electro-Optical/Infrared, hyperspectral imagery (HSI), Lidar/Ladar, and other technologies to improve measurement and signature intelligence, polarimetric imaging, ground moving target indicator (GMTI), maritime search/track, foliage penetration, nuclear event detection, and other modalities; increased geolocation accuracy; increased dismount detection capability; advanced sensor data correlation; automated target detection; network centric warfare; and other ISR and associated planning and direction; collection; processing and exploitation; analysis and production; and dissemination capabilities. These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.

The funds in this project are distributed in priority order, as supported by the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and set by the GCWG, for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the ASI AoA as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0305206F, project 674820, Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS)-2C (back-end), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Sensors Development project increases the range and collection capability, interoperability and processing of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar Systems (ASARS) through design, development, testing, and fielding efforts.  The Sensors Development efforts advance the capability of ASARS for U-2 employment, and is a critical component for the multi-INT Next Generation Sensors, project 672001, efforts.  ASARS-2B (front-end) &amp; ASARS-2C (back-end) efforts provide critical advancements and risk reduction in SAR/Moving Target Indication capability to be implemented in the future multi-INT, platform agnostic capability that Next Generation Sensors will provide. 

The ASARS effort is a fifth generation, deep-look, high-altitude, ISR radar that is the foundation for the radar component of the Next Generation Sensors (NGS) family of systems as outlined in the  AFROC approved ASARS-2C draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD).  ASARS-2B (front-end) is the antenna and receiver exciter replacement.  The ASARS-2C (back end) data processing efforts extend the ASARS-2B (front-end) radar capability using open architecture data processing and multi-platform integration.  Open architecture improves performance and lowers cost by facilitating and enabling qualified third party software vendors to incorporate future multi-ISR capability to advance interoperability across joint operations. ASARS increases current capability and addresses National Defense Strategy Key Operational Problems and ISR Dominance flight plan.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) is the DoD flight simulation/training system of choice for many Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), RPA, and airborne platforms.  MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force training application. The MUSE/AFSERS is a software suite that simulates UAS/RPA (e.g., MQ-9) systems, tailored air vehicle &amp; data links, and visualization systems used for payload product outputs-including Full Motion Video (FMV), Fixed Frame Imagery (FFI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data, and Link 16 (J2.2 and J3.5) tracking messages.  Outputs are compliant with applicable DoD standards and are continually tested against actual ground data processors to ensure DoD systems interoperability.  

The Services and Combatant Commanders have a requirement for training with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple domain systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations.  The MUSE creates a realistic operational environment supporting military utility assessment, architecture, and employment concept development.  Training, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) refinement, practice Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) of multi-domain information.  Conduct emerging concepts experimentation, optimizing Command, Control, Communications, and Computing (C4) with warfighting exercises and experiments. MUSE is the preferred UAS/RPA simulation system used by US Combatant Commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4 training.

The MUSE also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for new UAS/RPA system Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts.  MUSE conducts emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4 training optimization.

MUSE is currently used by all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite systems, P-3, E-8 and the U-2 during warfighting exercises.  The AFSERS provides National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) information for simulated data collection systems, supporting PED training.  The MUSE is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.  Most of the MUSE/AFSERS software suite components are also used in multiple airborne platform system training devices.  Including the MQ-9 [Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical (MALET) JSIL Aircrew Trainer (MJAT)] and RQ-4 [Global Hawk Sensor Operator Part Task Trainer (GHSOPTT), and Global Hawk Weapon System Trainer (WST)].

The Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is the training center of excellence supporting UAS and RPA programs for the Services.  JTC/SIL provides the system engineering, test and integration, interoperability, rapid technology insertion to address MUSE training requirements.  The JTC/SIL combines the UAS/RPA knowledge of communications standards (such as STANAGs 4586, 4607, 4545 and 4609) with Hardware in the Loop (HIL) testing, MUSE, integrating with other DoD modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) architectures.  For those airborne assets normally not available for training, the JTC/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces.  The JTC/SIL contributes to the distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, and are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture.  The JTC/SIL continues to develop leading edge technologies supporting the rapidly evolving UAS/RPA training requirements required to support NDS future fighting force.

MUSE project funds may be utilized to cover the GCWG Secretariat, studies and analysis activities, supporting current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Gorgon Stare system is a podded airborne sensor suite that provides city-sized wide area airborne surveillance and is integrated on specially-modified MQ-9 Reaper RPA. The Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) approved Air Combat Command's recommendation to transition Gorgon Stare from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to an Air Force Enduring Capability in November 2014. Gorgon Stare's requirements are documented in the Gorgon Stare Wide Area Airborne Sensor Capabilities Production Document (draft). The acquisition strategy for this Air Force podded sensor suite solution is sustainment of the currently fielded capabilities with any upgrades implemented via validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.

Development efforts conducted with FY 2015 Congressionally-added funds included efforts focused primarily on the development of a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability in support of an Urgent Operational Need. Development efforts conducted with FY 2016 Congressionally-added RDT&amp;E funds included further development and system integration lab testing of Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Gorgon Stare Increment 2 Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors. Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for future airborne integration efforts as required. Development efforts conducted with FY 2017 Congressionally-added funds further progressed efforts associated with BLOS, to include first article testing for phase 1 and a limited BLOS capability delivered to the field in FY2019. Development efforts conducted with FY 2018 Congressional added funds included further development of the next phase of BLOS to enable freedom of maneuverability and development of system imagery improvements. Development efforts conducted with FY 2019 Congressionally added funds included completion of BLOS Phase II system design and aircraft certification to enable full freedom on maneuverability, completing imagery improvements and continuation of data automation through Area of Interest (AOI) tagging and tracking efforts. Development efforts to be conducted with FY2020 Congressionally added funds include but are not limited to continuation of tagging and tracking efforts, development of an electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) fusion capability, and development of tip and cue airborne cueing.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Gorgon Stare capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>RDUCE provides efficient and integrated compression of airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor data, maximizing the use of limited bandwidth and delivering more data to the tactical user in the field. RDUCE develops, tests, and implements new sensor data compression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors. The program develops compression capabilities for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, and the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). Outputs will meet standard certification for use within the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community (IC) Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) compression applications. 

Activities also include continuous studies, analysis and updates to support program planning and execution. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Data Compression effort provides the warfighter capabilities to efficiently compress ISR data and to enable dissemination in near real time to tactical users through bandwidth limited dissemination systems. The program focuses on current and emerging ISR sensors, including incorporation into open architectures like Common Open Architecture Radar Programs (COARPs), Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE), and Sensor Open System Architecture (SOSA). The algorithms can be leveraged for any platform. For example, the HSI algorithm was selected by NASA to be included in an experimental system on the ISS. Outputs will meet standards certification for use within the DoD Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence and Measurement and Signatures Intelligence data compression applications.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>RC-135 operational systems development and enhancement activities support design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 programs and their specialized mission systems, both air and ground. Associated ground systems include RIVET JOINT Ground Data Processing Systems (GDPS), Distributed Mission Shelters (DMS), Mission Crew Training Systems (MCTS), Airborne Capabilities Extension System (ACES), and the Operational Flight Trainers (OFT, a.k.a. flight deck simulators). Extensive utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through upgrades and supports Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts. The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.

These activities are managed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (645 AESG).  The 645 AESG (a.k.a. BIG SAFARI) manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.

Aircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2021 budget includes developmental planning, execution and support for the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT Baselines 13 and 14 (BL-13 and BL-14), the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baseline 6 (BL-6), and the RC-135S COBRA BALL BL-6 and BL-7 configurations. The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding incremental spiral upgrades and baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations. The 645 AESG uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and associated ground support and training systems. Obsolescence and DMS/VVI logistical concerns are addressed with each baseline upgrade and assessed annually as part of the fleet sustainment responsibilities.

RIVET JOINT BL-13 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, providing a continuous recording capability, Super Wideband Compressive Receiver (SWCR) and Nyquist Folding Receiver (NYFR), CNS/ATM avionics upgrades such as new autopilot, automated data system-broadcast (ADS-B) and Mode 5 identify friendly or foe (IFF) systems, and family of beyond-line-of-sight terminals (FAB-T) advanced extremely high frequency (AEHF) communications suite.

COMBAT SENT BL-6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, steerable beams for the COMINT sub-system, improved SWCR capability and specific emitter identification (SEI) electronic intelligence (ELINT) sub- system, Primary Sensor Measurement System (PRISMS) merge with manual precision collections, millimeter wave and low band capabilities with PRISMS, digitizing antennas, direction finding of High Frequency signals and expanded streaming audio services and 360 degree aircraft tracking system. BL-6 RDT&amp;E is funded via PE 0305206G.

COBRA BALL BL-6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, high gain S-Band antenna, large format Sapphire windows, RJ BL-13 COMINT capability, foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT) analog to digital receiver, and Brave version of the digital cockpit avionics systems to continue CNS/ATM compliance initiatives. BL-6 RDT&amp;E is funded via PE 0301314F.

Ground Systems Baseline upgrades add the capabilities found in the corresponding RIVET JOINT Baseline upgrades (i.e., RIVET JOINT BL-12 corresponds to Ground System BL-12, RIVET JOINT BL-13 corresponds to Ground System BL-14, RIVET JOINT BL-15 corresponds to Ground System BL-15) to the Ground Systems to ensure crews receive training on the appropriate mission system configurations.
Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RC-135 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RC-135 RIVET JOINT, COBRA BALL, and COMBAT SENT configured aircraft are maintained and kept technologically relevant through an incremental baseline upgrade acquisition strategy.  Technology upgrades and Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments are acquired through the 645 AESG in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and Class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document for acquisition of supplies and services using an "other than full and open competition" criteria.  The supplies and services procured by 645 AESG satisfy National Security requirements (FAR 6.302-6) through the use of their standing J&amp;A or address Unusual and Compelling Urgency requirements (FAR 6.302-2) through an individually prepared J&amp;A supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management from developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave") support.  Due to the ever changing threat and rapidly evolving electromagnetic combat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Command (CCMD) and/or Intelligence Community (IC) requirements to better meet the war fighting objectives.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ScheduleDetailNote>Ground systems include the RIVET JOINT Mission Crew Training Systems (MCTS), Ground Data Processing System (GDPS), Modular Processing System (MPS), Airborne Capabilities Extension Systems (ACES) and Operational Flight Trainers (OFT).  Baseline upgrades are determined by the aircraft programmed depot maintenance schedule.  Hardware, firmware or software enhancements to the ground systems are set up to match the aircraft baseline upgrades.  Typically, baseline configuration changes and enhancements are incorporated first into the MCTSs and OFTs, and then integrated into GDPS, MPS, and ACES.  Delivery of the enhancements to the MCTSs and OFTs are planned to arrive concurrently, if not slightly prior, to the delivery of the first aircraft with an upgraded cockpit or mission system in a given baseline configuration to allow for aircrew and ground personnel training and qualification.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT, federated weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites and other collection systems.  

AF DCGS is designed to support Joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements and supports the "kill chain” across the full range of military operations. Currently, AF DCGS is composed of eight core sites (two active duty worldwide, three active duty regional and three Air National Guard regional), three remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, six SIGINT Distributed Mission Sites (four collocated with National Mission Partner), three Air National Guard full-motion video sites, three support sites, three training sites, and three integration and test sites. AF DCGS currently supports ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS-based locations. AF DCGS provides integrated ISR by providing quality, fused Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.

In alignment with DoD and AF direction, AF DCGS is migrating to an open architecture (OA DCGS) to rapidly incorporate new technologies and tools to easily integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as provide improved mission applications to meet emerging and urgent operational needs. AF DCGS integrates commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf services and applications to the maximum extent possible to fulfill operational requirements and data sharing requirements across the DoD DCGS community.   The next iteration will involve transitioning to a hybrid cloud (mix of private on premise and public cloud) architecture.

Program management consists of five ACAT III efforts: GEOINT Transformation, SIGINT Transformation, Multi-INT, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT)

1. GEOINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new GEOINT capabilities, enables quick/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, and command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.

2. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new SIGINT capabilities, enables quick/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates SIGINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.

3. Multi-INT-1: Rapidly integrates new and updated enterprise applications, to include voice/video/chat communications, collaboration and situational awareness, multi-INT fusion, and data analytics capabilities into the open architecture framework.  Also includes Intelligent Modeling and Predictive Analysis of Cyberspace Targeting (IMPACT) program, which develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing ISR and non-kinetic capabilities.  Addressees program office test and evaluation activities.

4. Network Infrastructure Transformation: Modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, commercial-based, architecture, improving data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery. OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture and public cloud represents the AF DCGS hybrid cloud (mix of private on premise and public cloud) architecture.

5. *DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.
NOTE:
*No additional RDT&amp;E or Investment Funding planned in FY20 or outyears; ACAT will be closed once the capability is installed at all sites

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Due to a Database Error, the additional $26M in FY19 OCO for "MQ-9 Development and Fielding" (Project 675246) was erroneously added to PE 0305208. This funding belongs in Air Force PE 0305829F,"Video Data Link". 

Video Data Link (VDL) Family of Systems (FoS) provides situational awareness (SA) to the operator on the ground using real time Full Motion Video (FMV) from secure line of sight links to airborne ISR, NTISR, PR and SF platforms. The FoS consists of interoperable Mounted (Airborne/Ground) and Handheld terminal variants. Current variants are utilized with 20 different platforms. Crypto Core Modernization (CCM) driven by NSA will create an imminent DMS issue by FY21; the current VDL equipment is incompatible with the enhanced Crypto Core.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Beginning in FY21, to support the divestiture of the Block 20/30 aircraft, efforts will be pivoted to focus on supporting the Block 40 fleet and closing out Block 30 efforts to maximize value to the USAF and DoD.

This program element funds related Air Force projects sharing the RQ-4 platform in common: the RQ-4 Block 30, the RQ-4 Block 40, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, and Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP). The RQ-4 Block 30 and Block 40 projects support the development and testing of the ACAT 1C RQ-4 capability and the initiation of the major modification ACAT programs. The majority of the modernization funding was transferred to the Capability Enhancement project (675149) to support upgrades and modifications, including established ACAT I and II programs, to the fielded RQ-4 weapon system to meet evolving threats and warfighter requirements. The MP-RTIP project completes development and testing of the baseline MDAP MP-RTIP sensor capability.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.

Per direction of USD(AT&amp;L), the RQ-4 program was restructured from the original project 675144 (Baseline) into multiple projects: (1) Block 30, (2) Block 40, (3) GroundSegment/Communications System, and (4) Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA). In FY17 the Ground Segment/Communications System project (675147) ended. In FY18 the RQ-4 Block 40 project (675146) ended. Prior year funds in the amount of $2031.377M were accounted for in project 675144, $85.375M were accounted for in project 675147, and $174.264M were accounted for in project 675146.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The RQ-4 Block 30 Project was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of projects, budgets had already been finalized.  Prior budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 Baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.

In FY 2021,  PE 0305220F, RQ-4 UAV, Project 675145, RQ-4 Block 30, efforts were transferred to PE 0305220F, RQ-4 UAV, Project 675149, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, in order to close out Block 30 efforts and focus on supporting the Block 40 fleet.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for Block 30 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) sensors, the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP), and alternate sensor payloads. 

This project supports system engineering/program management, test and evaluation, management services, and fielding support for all RQ-4 projects.  This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program to provide efficiencies.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts cover development, system upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts.  MS-177 Sensor Enhancement RDT&amp;E is being contracted directly with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Collins Aerospace.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for RQ-4 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for current and  alternate sensor payloads.

This funding also supports aircraft systems upgrades to include continuing airframe updates, aircraft operations surety, cybersecurity, airspace and interoperability enhancements, information assurance, and mission critical repair of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  This project will include systems engineering/program management, configuration and data management, test and evaluation, management services, Deficiency Report (DR)/Military Intelligence Program (MIP) Investigations, studies and analysis and fielding support for Block 30, Block 40, and Ground Segment/Communication Systems.

Activities include airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, airframe and software upgrades, effort to bring early production aircraft to current operational configurations, deficiency report resolution across RQ-4 fleet, sensor enhancements including data distribution and storage, and alternate sensor upgrades including the MS-177, ISR Payload Adapter, enhanced communications capabilities, support for demonstration and technology insertion, development and testing of ice protection system, enhanced mission flexibility to accommodate changes to mission objectives inflight, enhancements to support multi-domain contested environment operations, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  Additionally, this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 20/30/40 aircraft, including further development, mode creation, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities, continued aircraft/communications systems upgrade, increased power generation, additional radar modes, reliability and maintainability improvements, Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) efforts, as well as next-generation communications capabilities. GSMP resolves fleet grounding Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence issues associated with ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as building-based multi-aircraft control. It will also enhance interoperability data dissemination as well as provide training capability. This funding also addresses DMS resolution for other mission critical equipment.

RDT&amp;E funding in this project also supports design, development, integration and testing of the weapon system's legacy ground elements and communications capabilities to enhance functionality and maintain interoperability prior to GSMP fielding.  The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Elements (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Elements (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence information while remaining compliant with DoD cybersecurity network requirements to operate in the DoD Information Network (DoDIN).

This project supports system engineering/program management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for all RQ-4 projects.  This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program to provide efficiencies.  

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements. The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.

Beginning in FY21, to support the divestiture of the Block 20/30 aircraft, efforts will be pivoted to focus on supporting the Block 40 fleet and closing out Block 30 efforts to maximize value to the USAF and DoD.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts cover development, system upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts.  MS-177 Sensor Enhancement RDT&amp;E is being contracted directly with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Collins Aerospace.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY09, the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) funding was transferred to program 0305220F (RQ-4) Global Hawk (GH).  Therefore, the data in this package includes only FY09 and subsequent funding related to program 0305220F.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors to provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project (67RTIP) includes MP-RTIP modernization and integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 Platform. MP-RTIP modernization studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), Maritime Inverse SAR (MISAR), product improvements and other advanced capabilities. GH Program Office will continue integration of radar capabilities to include Maritime Modes integration into RQ-4 aircraft and ground systems. 

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MPRTIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record for geo-location and is responsible for developing core technologies supporting the horizontal and/or vertical integration of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems. The result of such integration is a multi-intelligence (multi-INT) sensor network. Operationally, NCCT Core Technologies provide a tactical collaborative multi-INT geolocation capability employed against high-value targets. NCCT software supports Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cross-cueing and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate collection activities across the NCCT network. NCCT correlation and fusion software ingests collection data to produce a single, composite track (geolocation and identification) in near real-time for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (for example Operations Interfaces, Network Controllers, Fusion Engines, Data Guards, Interface to Command &amp; Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO)), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies, global web-enabled services, and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements. 

NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, a network messaging standard, correlation and fusion software, software supporting tactical-to-national Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Concept of Operations (CONOPS), NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items and operator interfaces. Development funds support software modifications required for technology modernization specific to network and fusion architecture design, data fusion algorithms and cyber security, while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). FY 2021 funding will be dedicated to completing the transition of NCCT Core Technology to a cloud-enabled architecture across the enterprise, integrating with other intelligence phenomenologies, developing new multi-INT use cases, and the continuation of rapid software deliveries based on continuous user feedback and agile methodologies.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NCCT weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.”

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) Core Technology capabilities are developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG) in accordance with their Program Management Directive (PMD), Class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A), and Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management ("cradle to grave" support concept). Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging/evolving Combatant Commander requirements.

645 AESG, Wright Patterson AFB OH, manages the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts used to develop NCCT Core Technology.  645 AESG will develop NCCT Core Technology software on common hardware for systems and platforms designated to field this ISR capability.  Individual platform program management offices may contract directly with their prime contractors or through the 645 AESG for integration of NCCT capabilities on their respective systems and platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds the U.S. contribution to the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Direct Commercial Sale acquisition.  AGS is an airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance in all weather conditions.  It will provide NATO decision makers with near real time information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral and opposing ground and maritime forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting.  All NATO nations will have access to AGS collection data, creating opportunities for burden sharing with the processing and exploitation of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data.  

The AGS program includes: air and ground segment acquisitions, operations of the NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), development of operations and support definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  The air segment consists of five (5) air vehicles based on unique exportable configurations of the United States Air Force Global Hawk air frame, Navy Triton command and control architecture and the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar.  The U.S. will also integrate new Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the MP-RTIP radar for NATO AGS.  The ground segment consists of fixed site and transportable/mobile ground stations for air vehicle Command and Control (C2), data exploitation and distribution.  Operations and continuing In-Service Support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).

U.S. participation in NATO AGS was ratified by Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) signature/approval of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009 and includes 15 nations. In FY 2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS program to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for management and execution of the Research and Development effort.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Alliance Ground Surveillance weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the DoD's net-centric vision. The DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development, modernization, integration, test, and community support of the Enterprise services to include implementation of international standards (including NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse and provide a flexible and singularly sustainable path to information sharing across the global ISR enterprise including, Next Generation Interoperability (NGI), which will deliver modernized federation profiles, interfaces, methodologies, and data interchange standards without relying upon legacy DIB federation standards and dependencies through common language, common mechanisms, and quality exposure. The deployment of these services into the DI2E Common Data Fabric (CDF) will provide common applications and a managed service framework for the development, test and integration of machine-aided decision making capabilities. The I2O manages the DCGS Test Laboratory (DTL) at Hanscom AFB.  This facility supports software development and test for DI2E evaluation during exercises such as Enterprise Challenge and Storm Force. 

2) The DCGS Enterprise Interoperability effort provides support to OUSD(I), AF DCGS and NATO interoperability efforts. This includes the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.

3) The Imagery Processing effort develops the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) within the DCGS architecture. The VIP-C provides end-to-end image processing to include raw data ingest, data format standardization to facilitate exploitation, secondary image processing, metadata conditioning, and image quality enhancements. Current efforts are focused on 1) ensuring new sensors being fielded and associated data types can be processed and 2) increasing investment in the
Machine Assisted Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Exploitation (MAGE) capability.
 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Imagery Processing effort develops the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) within the DCGS architecture.  VIP-C accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and/or the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts include further developing the virtual software capability to improve processing across the enterprise and testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.  In addition, the project involves increasing capability through the Machine Assisted Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Exploitation (MAGE)effort.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>International Intelligence Technology and Architectures oversees, manages, and provides the United States (US) component of the multi-national Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems (BICES) with a collaborative environment and intelligence sharing enterprise required for processing and disseminating critical intelligence information between and among US, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), allied and coalition forces. The US BICES program procures and maintains a standing intelligence information sharing capability across Department of Defense (DoD), Combat Support Agencies (CSA), and multiple Combatant Commands (CCMD) for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (OUSD(I)). At the request of OUSD(I), US BICES is extended beyond NATO nations into all CCMDs to support their unique  partner relationships.  This architecture is known as US BICES Extended (US BICES-X). US BICES provides an "enduring" US and Coalition interoperable intelligence and information sharing multi-level secure technical architecture utilizing releasable elements of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework and functions to support the full spectrum of intelligence operations and dissemination throughout the DoD community. US BICES/US BICES-X has been designated the enduring intelligence and information sharing component of the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).

Research and Development funding will:
- Provide increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks and provide increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System Family of Systems.
- Expand available intelligence disciplines (Geospatial Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, and potentially Human Intelligence) to support US and allied/coalition forces.  
- Support increased intelligence advanced analytics tools, Joint Intelligence Operation Center-IT and DI2E developments to significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines.
- Develop and enhance a federated Trusted Network Environment (TNE) that incorporates Foreign Partner information sharing networks globally to support the National Defense Strategy.
- Develop multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.
- Expand capabilities for bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs in support of CCMD requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Rapid Cyber Acquisition (RCA) initiative provides new cyber capabilities in response to a continuously evolving threat environment. The delivery of capabilities to Combatant and Joint Force Commanders, in mission relevant timeframes (0-60 days), enhances the nation's ability to operate within the highly-dynamic cyberspace domain.

The RCA initiative expedites cyber development and modifications of USAF cyber capabilities through the integration with and technical support to other Service and Government Agency activities to leverage select Air Force-developed technologies and/or operational capabilities. RCA develops material or non-material cyber solutions and conducts rapid prototyping, integration, and transition activities of cyber capabilities. Activities include but are not limited to development of software/hardware systems, integration and transition of lab-developed cyber capabilities, developmental testing, operational evaluation, manpower, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction efforts for emerging technologies.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Rapid Cyber Acquisition capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $0.198 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balance.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain a segment of Air Force's C2 capabilities and services associated with Personnel Recovery (PR). The Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program develops and delivers tools and services for planning, collaborating and managing search and rescue efforts, as well as disseminating related information to all personnel recovery mission coordinators across the PR network. PRC2 provides an adaptive and networked system, delivering timely situational awareness information supporting personnel accountability and recovery mission management worldwide. PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, inter-operable and integrated set of capabilities to prevent, prepare for and respond to joint/coalition military personnel recovery activities, and civilian rescue missions.  The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) Initial Capability Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2. Annex A to the Personnel Recovery Mission Version 3.0 is the requirement document for initial and full operational capability (IOC/FOC) criteria.

The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, Isolated Personnel (IP) reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities. The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of PR across the Department of Defense and other national and international entities. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

In FY 2021, Personnel Recover Mission Manager (PRMM) modifications will continue to use an Agile Development Security Operations (DevSecOps) strategy to develop, test and have field-ready PRMM versions in two week increments (sprints) with capability to field by individual story. The modifications will improve/validate IP events/alerts and enable case files for Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) and Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA). PRMM modifications will reflect the requirements and priorities identified by Air Combat Command (ACC) as the personnel recovery environment evolves to meet the needs of the warfighter and personnel recovery efforts.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver PRC2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $0.345 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intelligence Mission Data (IMD) encompasses several key intelligence data efforts used to support IMD-dependent programs, including the fifth generation aircraft capabilities. The term IMD encompasses Red (adversary military systems), White (commercial systems), Blue (U.S. military systems), and Grey (neutral military systems) Characteristics &amp; Performance; Signatures; Geospatial Intelligence; Electronic Warfare systems and Operational Order of Battle mission data. Supports fighter/bomber operational reconnaissance and integration, focusing on leveraging fifth generation aircraft capabilities to augment the entire Combat Air Force. The PE funds: Planning &amp; direction, collection, processing &amp; exploitation, analysis &amp; production, and dissemination &amp; Evaluation  (PCPAD-E) to support IMD-dependent programs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-130H is a medium sized tactical transport aircraft providing multi-purpose theater support throughout the globe. The C-130H fleet supports several diverse Air
Force roles, including but not limited to tactical and inter-theater airlift and airdrop support, Arctic resupply, special operations support, aeromedical evacuation, aerial
spraying, firefighting duties, and natural disaster and humanitarian relief missions.

C-130H AMP Increment 1 addresses modifications to meet airspace compliance mandates and safety requirements. RDT&amp;E efforts cover design, integration,
developmental and operational test, studies and risk reduction efforts, trial kit buy and installation, spares and peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs,
type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and course ware development efforts, program office support and other efforts necessary to fulfill program requirements.

C-130H AMP Increment 2 includes digital avionics upgrades (e.g. Flight Management System, improved navigation), cockpit modernization (e.g. glass/engine flight
displays) and resolves select obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues. RDT&amp;E efforts will cover software development, design, integration,
developmental and operational test, studies and risk reduction efforts, trial kit buy and installation, technical order development validation and verification, spares and
peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs, Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL) development, type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance
training systems and course ware development efforts, program office support and other efforts necessary to fulfill program requirements.

The development and fielding of the MUOS/SATURN Radio program (Project 672030) will be executed under the AMP Increment 2 program (Project 675250). The MUOS/Saturn Radio program updates radios due to future DMS/integration issues and the incorporation of MUOS/SATURN capabilities. The funding is required for the Non-Recurring Effort associated with integration, testing, Technical Orders, Engineering drawing's, Trial Kit Installations, Verification Kit Installations, and spectrum authorization.  

This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including but not limited to prototyping, capability development, process activities, planning
analysis and systems engineering activities.

Project 672030, C-130H MUOS/SATURN Radio changed from C-130H MUOS Radio. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130H weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The development and fielding of the MUOS/SATURN Radio program will be executed under the AMP Increment 2 program. The MUOS/Saturn Radio program updates radios due to future Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS)/integration issues and the incorporation of MUOS/SATURN capabilities. The funding is required for the Non-Recurring Effort associated with integration, testing, TO's, Engineering drawing's, TKI, VKI, and spectrum authorization.
  
The C-130H MUOS/SATURN Radio program modifies up to 176 C-130H USAF-owned aircraft consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s, H1s and LC-130H aircraft. The modification effort will have up to four prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the remaining aircraft modified in the production phase.

This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including but not limited to prototyping, capability development, process activities, planning analysis and systems engineering activities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130H weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.  The program may also include any Contractor Manpower Equivalent (CME)/A&amp;AS support deemed necessary to support the program objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130H AMP Increment 1 program performs modifications to meet airspace compliance and safety mandates; the mod includes Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out, Enhanced Mode S, 8.33 kHz radios, and Cockpit Voice Recorder/Digital Flight Data Recorder (CVR/DFDR).

RDT&amp;E efforts include but are not limited to, design, integration, development and operational test, studies and risk reduction efforts, trial kit buy and installation, spares and peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs, Type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts (including Mode 5 effort for the trainers), program office support and other efforts necessary to fulfill program mandates and requirements.  Obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues will be resolved with solutions that may include life of type buys or bridge buys.  DMS efforts to include removal of end of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130H AMP Increment 2 upgrades the C-130H fleet with comprehensive avionics and cockpit modernization which replaces aging unreliable equipment and adds combat capability enhancements. It also updates radios due to future Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)/integration issues and incorporation of MUOS/SATURN radio capabilities. It also addresses select obsolescence and DMS issues with solutions that may include life of type buys or bridge buys.  DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

RDT&amp;E efforts include but are not limited to software development, design, integration, development and operational test, studies and risk reduction efforts, trial kit buy and installation, technical order development validation and verification, peculiar support equipment and spares in support of trial kit installs, SIL development, type 1 training, and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts, program office support and other efforts required to fulfill requirements.

The C-130H AMP Increment 2 program modifies up to 176 C-130H USAF owned aircraft consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s,H1s and LC-130H aircraft. The modification effort will have up to four prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the remaining aircraft modified in the production phase.

The development and fielding of the MUOS/SATURN program will be executed under the AMP Increment 2 program. The MUOS radio funding is required for the Non-Recurring Effort associated with integration, testing, Technical Order's, Engineering drawings, Trial Kit Installations, Verification Kit Installations, and spectrum authorization.  

This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including but not limited to prototyping, capability development, process activities, planning analysis and systems engineering activities.
 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AMP Increment 1 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F. The program may also include any Contractor Manpower Equivalent (CME)/A&amp;AS support deemed necessary to support the program objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: AMP Increment 2 is evaluated against traditional Research and Development (R&amp;D) program expenditure benchmarks. Unlike many traditional R&amp;D programs, however, the AMP Increment 2 EMD phase contract is an FPIF contract with progress payments. 20 percent of incurred costs are withheld until the end of the contract, when they are liquidated. Mandatory funding obligations and progress payment withholds will cause the program to lag traditional expenditure benchmarks, painting an inaccurate portrait of overall program health.</r2:Remarks>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-5M operates across the entire range of military operations. It is the only aircraft capable of carrying 100% of certified air-transportable cargo and includes a dedicated passenger compartment enabling commanders to have troops and their equipment arrive in an area of operation simultaneously when national security concerns demand fast force closure. C-5M missions include strategic airlift of cargo and passengers as well as emergency aeromedical evacuation (AE). The aircraft must perform these missions throughout the worldwide air traffic control environment with the proper equipment to operate in FAA/ICAO controlled airspace. Additionally, C-5M aircraft must operate at night, in adverse weather conditions, and in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (excluding electromagnetic pulse in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversights Council (JROC) approved/validated the C-5 RERP ORD 14 Aug 01, see Appendix B, Ref YY, page 11, para 4.3.1), and High Explosive (CBRNE) environments.

C-5M communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate CNS/ATM system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5M to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5M CNS/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5M. CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

C-5M Replace Multi-function Controls and Displays (RMCD) program helps to maintain aircraft availability and increased situational awareness though a new Multi Function Display Unit (MFDU)replace the current 20+ year MFDU design; current equipment is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Additionally, there is a requirement to reduce Operational Flight Program (OFP) load times and improve load reliability and provide outlets for Mission Planning Equipment (MPE) to enhance operational mission support. The current generation of displays and controls supporting services used on the C-5M will no longer be repairable beginning in 4th Quarter, FY24 for MFDU. Without this modification, the C-5M will be unable to support the National Defense Strategy, AF Strategic Master Plan, Geographical Combatant Command Operational Plans.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5 weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

Funding to provide for program management &amp; administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>C-5M Replace multi-function controls and display (RMCD) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate RMCD Line Replaceable Units (LRU) are developed and installed on the C-5M allowing aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. The C-5M RMCD program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification. The purpose of the program is to find a suitable replacement for the current multi-function display unit (MFDU) LRUs while maintaining existing interfaces to legacy equipment and providing for future growth opportunities.  Additionally, the replacement LRUs must have the Ethernet load capability to reduce Operational Flight Programs (OFP) load times, and the program will implement a power solution for Mission Planning Equipment (MPE). Operational Flight Programs (OFP) updates/aggregation are required to support the latest aircraft display technologies and will be designed to ensure seamless integration into the platform.  Aircraft wiring will be replaced/upgraded as required. Use of mixed displays (current and new) is not permissible due to human factors considerations. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The RMCD program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current control and display units. This effort centers around modifying the current display units to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading displays and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development, including additions of an Ethernet loading capability and a power solution for the MPE. This modification may include software non-recurring engineering (NRE), data, cyber security, testing, installation, spares, systems integration lab (SIL), Interim Contractor Support (ICS), program support, etc.

The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new multifunctional controls and displays replaces the current controls and displays, which are experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues. Failure to upgrade the displays to support aircraft availability will create a significant operational impact to the support of Geographic Combatant Command (GCCs) and maintaining U.S. National objectives. Further, Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5M weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

Available funds may be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Program Office completed an Early Strategy &amp; Issues Session (ESIS) in September 2019, with the Acquisition Strategy Plan (ASP) anticipated at the end of January 2020. The Program Office received approval to pursue an Other Transaction Authority to procure prototype hardware in December 2019. The overall strategy is to procure the display units and graphics processors, integrate and test those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft.  The Acquisition Strategy (AS) for the RMCD has not been determined/approved as of Jan 2020.  

Program Office anticipates that the primary contract type will be that of Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) with some Firm Fixed Price (FFP) elements. The Other
Transaction for Prototype is anticipated to be FFP. 

The integration of hardware, displays and graphics processors, and the software may be required to be Sole Source (SS) to Lockheed Martin, who holds the Data Rights to critical software and software documentation. Access to these items may be required to acquire the platform certifications necessary to put the final system onto test aircraft.

Program office will consider the use of commercial components.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>C-5M communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate CNS/ATM system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5M to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5M CNS/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5M. CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The current ARC-210 radio for VHF voice communications is facing diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) supply issues and additionally will no longer be capable of providing secure voice communications due to the development of new crypto algorithms. Addition of next generation ARC-210 radios with embedded Integrated Waveform (IW) and Second-generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO (SATURN) and associated cryptologic equipment will enable the C-5M to meet NSA mandates for secure communications and allow aircrews to continue to communicate securely over VHF, UHF, HF, or MILSATCOM.

The current generation of satellites that support services used on the C-5M to provide oceanic controller/pilot data link communications (CPDLCs) to air traffic control and aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) beyond-line-of-sight command and control messages is no longer functional post 2016. The next generation of satellites will accommodate legacy C-5M SATCOM equipment for an interim period of time to allow for integration of upgraded SATCOM equipment compatible with this satellite constellation. Without this modification, the C-5M will be unable to fly oceanic tracks and will not be able to meet aircraft separation distance requirements for civil airspace access.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of air traffic control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning. ADS-B Out will allow aircraft to provide continuous broadcast of aircraft position to both controllers and other aircraft equipped with ADS-B In capable avionics. International mandates for ADS-B Out for civil airspace access call for equipage by 2020.

Available funds will be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5M weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CNS/ATM program:  Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for incorporation of the ARC-210 Gen V radio, SATCOM replacement equipment, ADS-B Out, and IFF mode 5 into the C-5M began in Dec 2016. The acquisition strategy for this program will consider every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5M CNS/ATM equipment to meet CY2020 mandates for global civil airspace access. The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure CNS/ATM equipment, develop software, test and integrate those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft.  The equipment integration will require RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf and non-developmental item proofing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-17 can perform the entire spectrum of airlift missions and is specifically designed to operate effectively and efficiently in both strategic and theater environments.  Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment, sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during air/land operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.

C-17 Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding efforts support, but are not limited to:  Aircraft performance improvements, aircraft mission execution and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering/program management administration support; support for avionics laboratories; software development, test and integration; block development/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-17 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

In FY21 the efforts are:  Roll-On Conference Capsule (ROCC)and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) which will be covered in more detail on subsequent pages.

This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform-related rapid capability development process activities including early planning, analysis and systems engineering activities which provide linkages between operational needs, system performance requirements, technology needs and opportunities, potential lifecycle costs and enabling the technical foundation for material development.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-130J is a medium-sized transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.

This project provides RDT&amp;E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as "Block" upgrades or "Capability" updates. Content/requirements for block modifications is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs) as determined in the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process. This project will integrate the common-core capabilities developed under this program into the C-130J.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130J weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Activities required to complete development and integration of the common-core capabilities for all United States' variants are included in this project.

This project also provides RDT&amp;E funding for requirements that are outside of the "Block" upgrades, "Capability" updates, or COSSURM process. These efforts may include, but are not limited to, communication, data link, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), electronic warfare, and mission support system updates.  The requirements are identified and concurred between the C-130J Program Office and Air Mobility Command (AMC).  Requirements are documented through the C-130J Program Office approval process.

This project provides RDT&amp;E funding for studies and risk reduction activities and Program Management Administration (PMA).

This project includes RDT&amp;E funding for the following C-130J aircraft variants: C-130J stretch aircraft, C-130J short aircraft, EC-130J aircraft, WC-130J aircraft, HC-130J aircraft, MC-130J aircraft, and AC-130J aircraft. 

This project included RDT&amp;E funding for Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including, but not limited to, prototyping, capability development, process activities, planning analysis, and systems engineering activities.   

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130J weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C-130J aircraft will be modified using a "block upgrade" strategy. The CNS/ATM, navigation safety requirement will initially be met in three block upgrades. Block 6.0 development was funded from FY03-07. Block 7.0 started in FY07, and Block 8.1 began in FY12. Subsequently, C-130J modifications will be grouped into smaller updates known as Capability Management Updates (CMU).  Other AMC initiatives are upgrades to hardware and software that have arisen after the formation of the block upgrades and CMUs.

In order to better manage the fleet and to avoid having to simultaneously support three separate aircraft configurations (Block 6, Block 7 and Block 8.1) the USAF has decided to combine the Block 7 and Block 8.1 mods.  This will allow aircraft and trainers to only have to be modified one time.

The proportion of CNS/ATM and navigation safety requirements allocated to Blocks 6.0 through 8.1 was determined via a design trade study conducted by Lockheed Martin (the C-130J prime contractor) and verified by the C-130J system program office and AMC. The development costs are being shared via a global Project Arrangement (PA) by the United States (USAF, USMC, USCG), the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Norway. An international program office (IPO), with USAF lead (Wright Patterson AFB, OH), manages the block upgrades development and CMU efforts. Retrofit of a Block on the aircraft is the responsibility of each nation.

To meet the Federal Aviation Administration 2020 mandate, the USAF installed the Block 8.1 ADS-B Out/Mode V IFF solution on all C-130J variants not scheduled to receive Block 8.1 by January 2020.  This is Mod #8649, ADS-B Out Acceleration. All C-130Js will still require Block 8.1.

In order to meet four DoD technology refresh mandates before end of year 2024, the communications modernization program will develop and field a federated and integrated communications system to Blocks 6.0 and 8.1 C-130J variants.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project will enhance aircrew simulator fidelity utilizing aircraft flight tests to gather data to accurately emulate ground effect, nose wheel and engine-out data points. Currently the simulator is approved to accomplish only 50% of annual assault landings. This added capability will allow more training to be accomplished in the simulator so the aircraft will be available for more real world missions. The ability to accomplish more training in the simulator also reduces the annual aircraft O&amp;M requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat. The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN/AAQ-24V] consists of missile warning sensors (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles. The number of sensors and transmitter assemblies per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft. The system is fully automatic following system power-up. LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98. The system is currently installed on 54+ aircraft types and over 1200 aircraft.

The baseline program development is complete.  Follow-on efforts are addressing integration onto new aircraft types and existing LAIRCM platforms, design changes to address Reliability Maintainability &amp; Availability and system improvements to counter new and emerging threats. 

LAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to, hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats. 

Current and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Testing; Virtual System Integration Lab (SIL) Development; and Studies and Analysis.

Threat Analysis: Threat analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required. Typical threat analysis activities include: threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system, and the evaluation/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to infrared countermeasures (IRCM).

Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation Testing: Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation activities verify and validate the information obtained from the threat analysis activities. These activities include: evaluation of (IRCM) techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code; validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware; evaluating system effectiveness; performing platform integration support tests; and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.

Virtual SIL Development: Incrementally design, develop, integrate, and test software code and purchase associated infrastructure (i.e., computers, servers, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, etc.) necessary to develop and implement a virtual SIL providing a critical capability for testing the LAIRCM system to ensure continued effectiveness against current and emerging threats.

Studies and Analysis: Includes logistics, programmatic, and engineering studies and analysis activities to ensure continued system viability and sustainability and compliance with acquisition directives. These activities may include the evaluation of low cost/high payback opportunities to reduce software development/implementation cost, enhance production efficiency, and improve life cycle costs through increased reliability and reduced repair and return cost.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to, contract services and government costs.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver LAIRCM weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) radios is a new start and is a major thrust in FY21.  The KC-135 currently utilizes the legacy V/UHF satellite system, UHF Follow-On (UFO), to communicate with their controlling Command &amp; Control (C2) agencies and other warfighters. This program adds to the current system by providing Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) and Line Of Sight (LOS) capability for secure voice and C2 data communications exchange between MAF aircraft and C2 agencies and is capable of operating with new crypto algorithms being developed under the VINSON/ANDVT Crypto Modernization (VACM) Program by National Security Agency.

KC-135 funding also supports Program Management Administration (PMA),various studies, analyses, and KC-135 requirements definition and demonstrations in support of Air Force Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) initiative.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver KC-135 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The KC-10 is an aerial refueling asset built on the commercial DC-10 airframe.  This aircraft creates an air bridge enabling rapid global mobility and global strike missions.  There are 59 KC-10 aircraft in the USAF tanker fleet. KC-10 has a divestiture strategy that will follow Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act and Air Force requirements.

Mode 5 program is a Department of Defense mandated upgrade to the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, the primary means of command and control aircraft identification.  Mode 5 increases anti-spoofing capabilities and lowers the possibility of aircraft/aircrew loss due to misidentification of friendly aircraft.  The KC-10 modification program includes a Mode 5 capable APX-119 transponder, a new KIV-77 crypto applique and integration/control through the CDU-7000F flight management computer. 

A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out upgrade to the KC-10 is also included as part of Mode 5 to meet DO-260B requirements set by the FAA. Both IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out are mandated programs (Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 047-07 and FAA Advisory Circular 20-165B) that have a required incorporation no later than 1 January 2020 (ADS-B) and 1 July 2020 (Mode 5).  Both modifications are accomplished by modification of the APX-119 Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) and can easily be accomplished at the same time and at a significant cost savings to the Air Force. 

The program completed formal Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and will procure kits for installation on all KC-10 aircraft.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver KC-10 weapon system  capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>October 2017, VC-25A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) was de-scoped from upgrading the flight deck avionics to compliance with the mandates for civil Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and DoD Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 capability supporting the President of the United States as Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  

Installations are aligned with the aircraft heavy maintenance (HM) schedule. The de-scoped AMP requirements to ADS-B Out and IFF Mode 5 must integrate the 2020 mandate capability in HM18-8 and HM20-9 utilizing the remaining FY 2018 funds for test, tech data integration, System Integration Lab (SIL), field team and other government costs. The National Security Waiver signed by Secretary of the Air Force 11 Dec 18 included the capability for ADS-B Out and IFF Mode 5 full FAA compliance 2025, which would utilize procurement funds but has not been funded.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver VC-25A weapon system  capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is the Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the joint multi-mission V-22 tilt rotor aircraft. The CV-22 provides long-range, high-speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. The Navy is the lead service for the Joint V-22 program.  The Joint Program Manager is responsible for managing all variants of the V-22.  Department of the Navy (DoN) funds the development of the MV-22 and CMV-22.  The Air Force funds the service common portion of the CV-22 while United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) funds the development and procurement of SOF peculiar systems.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E funding provides for the development, integration, and testing of service-common, mission critical aircraft modifications to improve operational effectiveness, platform survivability, and aircraft availability.  
 
Nacelle Improvements:  Funds the design and development of the CV-22 nacelle to increase engine time on wing by reducing ingestion of sand/dust and other particulate matter into the engine, improving reliability and maintainability and reducing operations and support costs.  This is Air Force Special Operations Command's #1 priority for the CV-22 weapon system. 

Enhanced Self-Deployment:  RDT&amp;E funding provides for the design, development, and testing of aircraft modifications to improve aircraft self-deployment capabilities (e.g., operating range, global response time) to mitigate emerging threats to the aircraft and mission accomplishment, and to identify and assess emerging air vehicle, propulsion system, avionics architecture, electronic warfare, situational awareness, and other weapon system solutions in meeting CV-22 Block C/20 capability requirements.  

Future Capabilities/Affordable Sustainability:  Funding provides for future modification planning, and for aircraft engineering changes/upgrades to address diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) and component obsolescence issues adversely affecting aircraft readiness and operational availability rates, as well as improved operational safety, suitability, cyber security, and mission effectiveness.
 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CV-22 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The V-22 Joint Program Office (Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM), PMA-275) is developing new capabilities for the V-22 in block increments.  

--Nacelle Improvements:  IIS, IRS and GCU will utilize a combination of sole source and competitive contracts. 

--Enhanced Self-Deployment Capabilities: Modular Avionics, FCC, and performance buyback will utilize a combination of sole source and competitive contracts. 
 

Development activities for the V-22 program to date have been primarily performed by the prime contractor, Bell-Boeing, on a sole-source basis.  Bell-Boeing is a strategic partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.  Efforts are underway to continue increasing competition where feasible, depending primarily on the level of platform integration required and Government rights to needed technical data.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification

Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) Increment 1.
The CAMPS Increment I program is the primary critical joint requirements management system for Special Assignment Air Mission (SAAM), Air Refueling (AR) scheduling, and Intra-theater air movement requests. It is also the primary USTRANSCOM and Air Mobility Command Command and Control (AMC C2) planning and scheduling tool enabling Mobility Air Force (MAF) resources to support peacetime, contingency, humanitarian, and wartime operations. In the Air Refueling Management System (ARMS), CAMPS provides the ability to request, manage and validate requests for air refueling.  Force-level CAMPS users include the USTRANSCOM Fusion Center, 618th Air Operations Center (AOC) Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), and other AOC Air Mobility Divisions (AMDs). Several web-based applications also support movement and air refueling requests for globally distributed Joint, Service, and Wing/Unit level users.

The 618 AOC (TACC) is a global air operations center responsible for planning and executing airlift and air refueling missions in support of the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE). Although primarily used by the 618 AOC (TACC), CAMPS also supports validation, planning, and scheduling activities found at AMD and USTRANSCOM. CAMPS airlift and air refueling requirement management applications are available for all globally distributed Joint, Service, and Wing/Unit level users that need to request airlift or air refueling. 

The current CAMPS AR scheduling capability does not have access to all data sources necessary to maintain visibility of and support for all potential re-planning requirements and therefore can have ‘blind spots' which hinder its ability to provide robust support for planning and re-planning across the entire "initial through final” planning phase. This CAMPS Increment I (modernization) effort will build on the existing technology transitioned from RDT&amp;E initiatives.  

FY19 continued funding for Air Refueling scheduling capability development and testing to provide planners an integrated human-in-the-loop and machine-based cooperative system which provides the ability to rapidly generate and evaluate multiple potential solution candidates to satisfy  requirements.  This increases the effectiveness and efficiency with which Air Refueling assets are employed and support increased operational agility through rapid, effective and efficient re-planning while minimizing the impact on currently planned mission sets.  The AR scheduling metrics component enables on-going improvement of the AR scheduling system and can be developed after extensive analysis and iterations with the constituent user sets and command authorities. Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0401840F.

Funding obligated in FY19 was $538K, remaining $1.1M will be obligated in FY20. ARST continues into FY20 as SPARTA capabilities are integrated by the end of the FY.  No additional funding will requested or required.  Further development of Air Refueling capabilities past FY20 will be funded by TWCF.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CAMPS Inc 1 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Special Tactics (ST) System Development project focuses on modernization development for the Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) Kit.  BAO Kit will develop, test, train, and modernize the existing and future Family of Systems (FoS) that provide a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability. It also provides a suite of systems for all Air Force Specialty Codes supporting the ST community within the Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Special Warfare operators. ST System Development focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through various core capabilities, which include but are not limited to: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, medical monitoring, and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) C4ISR System and all other ST capability needs.

This program will develop and enhance technologies for Special Warfare ST operators to recognize, identify, range, nominate, and designate targets during both day and night operations. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, track, fix targets, and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre- and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. BAO Kit systems are light, compact, and portable for use by dismounted Special Warfare ST operators. FY21 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness, and precision lethality in the battle space while continuing to build and enhance the BAO Kit family of systems. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes, and associated engineering support to posture the BAO Kit for technology insertion.  These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increase mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. BAO also supports AFSOC Tactical Command and Control (TAC C2) programs to develop and enhance communications systems and equipment essential for ST combat controllers, pararescue, combat weather operators, and tactical air controller parties within AFSOC to perform their mission. The ST operators use this equipment to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield/assault landing/drop zone operations. Due to the rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements. The above efforts may change based on the need to support current Air Force mission requirements.  

Program changes in progress.  This applies to both PE 0207227F and 0408011F.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver special tactic weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.


The Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies, analysis, and risk-reduction activities to support both current and future program planning and execution.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program develops, tests, and evaluates national and Air Force measurement standards (hardware) and calibration equipment in support of all Air Force programs and activities, including Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) worldwide.  Metrology research and development provides technology to support systems in all phases of development and acquisition, as well as Air Force R&amp;D laboratories, test ranges, ground test facilities, and operational weapons systems support. Rapidly changing technology requires continuing research and development of measurement standards and calibration equipment to ensure modern weapon systems meet Air Force readiness objectives. This program addresses all metrology disciplines and includes the technology areas of laser, infrared, microwave, millimeter wave, optical, physical, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and ionizing radiation measurements. Metrology is a technical discipline devoted to the science of measurements and to the study and improvement of measurement technology.  Measurements are the foundation of military system development, quality assurance, hardware conformance testing and system readiness tests.  The integrity of these tests is assured through calibration and traceability assurance schemes.  The capability to measure and calibrate must parallel the emergence of new technology, new ranges, and new capabilities of military systems.  Lack of new measurement capability impedes or blocks the successful exploitation of new technologies, especially in the movement from development laboratory to production to deployment.  R&amp;D efforts are essential within the DoD to pace these requirements, otherwise, these same new systems will suffer time delays, excessive cost, and increased risk due to unreliable test results in all phases of development, production, deployment and operation.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute and deliver 0702207F.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.    

Program is managed by Air Force Materiel Command, Agile Combat Support Directorate, Air Force Metrology Division (WNM).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2020 PE 0708055F, MROi efforts were transferred from Project 675207 to Project 675329, Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul Initiative, in order to improve transparency of this Business System Category II (BCAT II), formerly an ACAT I acquisition program.

The FY21 funding request was reduced by $10M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>MROi creates and integrates capability that plans, schedules and executes organic depot maintenance support functions, and integrates capture of auditable financial transactions at point of work critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, as well as resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.

FY21 funding will support continued development and integration leading to planned Full Deployment Decision capabilities. The MROi implementer will continue to configure the Oracle suite for comprehensive program requirements; configure associated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) support software; and develop Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Extensions (RICE) software.  

Collaborative and combined development and operational testing is being performed iteratively throughout the development, configuration, integration, and deployment. Funds will be used to perform logistics system risk reduction as well as studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development, and mobile applications.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MROi business system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

This requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020 PE 0708055, Project 675207, MROi efforts transfered to PE 0708055F, Project 675329, Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul System, in order to improve transparency of this Business System Category II (BCAT II), formerly an ACAT I acquisition program.

FY18/19 funds of $82.610M were executed from PE 0708055F, Project 675207. Prior Year Funding $23.126M was executed in PE 0708610F.

As a result of the transition form DoDI 5000.02 to DoDI 5000.75, MROi was reclassified to a BCAT II program as reflected in the 11 Apr 2018 MROi Milestone B ADM.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Initiative (MROi) is an enterprise resource planning IT system that provides an integrated capability for planning, scheduling, and executing organic depot maintenance and as well as integrating capture of auditable financial transactions at point of work to support agile planning, optimized workload assignment and resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.

FY 2021 funding will support the development and integration of MROi, leading to a planned Full Deployment Decision/Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (ATP). Additionally, funding will support advisory and assistance services necessary to assist in the planning, development, execution, and reporting of system program office duties and responsibilities and other program office costs.  The MROi implementer will continue to configure the Oracle suite for comprehensive program requirements; configure associated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) support software; develop Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Extensions (RICE) software; and develop training materials.  Collaborative and combined development and operational testing is being performed iteratively throughout the development, configuration, integration, and deployment using agile software methodology. Funds will also be used to perform logistics system risk reduction as well as studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile applications.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MROi system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF requires an integrated logistics capability that provides timely, accurate and reliable information to decision makers at all levels of command and across the full range of military operations.  

FIAR and Software Upgrades:

- The remediation and modification of core logistics systems is necessary for the AF to meet statutory Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirements and align with the Joint Chiefs of Staff J-4 Concept for Logistics, and the AF Portfolio Board's approved Logistics Flight Plan. The AF must concurrently sustain and modify identified logistics systems to achieve FIAR remediation by the statutory deadline; execute software upgrades to reduce high operating costs and meet evolving operational demands; implement statutory compliance requirements; improve system performance; and enable system consolidation efforts that lower the cyber threat space and reduce long-term portfolio costs.

- Identified systems include, but are not limited to, the Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS), Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS). Additional logistics systems may be included as financial audits are completed and system consolidation efforts mature.

Transformation:

- The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous custom stovepipe systems and processes that perform similar tasks. Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more secure, resilient, efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics. The objective of transformation is to conduct Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to identify and eliminate overlaps in business processes across core logistics systems and, where appropriate, implement new IT systems that employ best commercial practices and modern cloud-based architectures. 

- The AF will take full advantage of the flexibilities provided by DoDI 5000.75, Business Systems Requirements and Acquisition guidance, as well as Agile development methodologies to identify requirements across the spectrum of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P); and to acquire and deploy approved material solutions in the most efficient and effective manner possible utilizing the 5-phased Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC).  These phases are structured to optimize a joint  responsibility of functional and acquisition activities, leading to the successful delivery of the business capability.  There will be an emphasis placed on acquisition of business systems aligned to commercial best practices utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS) solutions, and modern platforms that support continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) following a development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) methodology. 

- The AF logistics enterprise is comprised of multiple overarching functional areas, to include base and depot-level maintenance, end-to-end supply chain management, and predictive analysis and forecasting. The AF will standardize its business processes within each major logistics functional area through Transformational Capability Initiatives (CIs). These CIs include, but are not limited to: Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MROi PE 0708055F), Item Master, Supply Capability Initiative, Air Force Product Lifecycle Management (AF-PLM), and Field Maintenance Capability Initiative. There may be one or more specific initiatives aligned to each of the major CI areas referenced above.


Transformation Capability Initiatives (TCI):

- TCI Item Master Logistics Capability Initiative (IMLCI) provides the capability to manage comprehensive, accurate, reliable item master data (e.g., accurate identification and authorization of owners and users of items).  Item Master is a key component of the Air Force (AF) Logistics Capability Transformation Plan.  It will provide Item standardization and configuration management from a single authoritative source, ensuring foundational logistics processes are executed in concert to support the A4 logistics baseline.  Item Master will enable key integration and transformation capabilities, including Item Unique Identification (IUID)association to business transactions; streamlined management of part item attributes across supply, finance, engineering, technology, transportation, maintenance, and vendor communities; and provide translation capabilities between functional and technical business communities and systems.

- TCI Supply Capability Initiative is focused on enabling simplified, standardized processes to fundamentally enhance the business operations and provide total asset visibility across the supply chain.  These improvements have been identified in the USAF Logistics Capabilities Transformation Plan.


- TCI Field Maintenance will improve the AF field maintenance capabilities across Mission Generation Network (MGN) and Repair Network (RN) (e.g. propulsion, avionics, command and control (C2) enabler systems, cyber systems, communications-electronics &amp; simulation, Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL), etc.) including the planning, scheduling, execution and oversight of functional deficiencies incurred over the past 10 years due to lack of prioritized funding and failure of the previous enterprise-wide modernization approach.


----------------

- Funds will be used to perform innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile applications that cross and support all of the aforementioned initiatives.  

- This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Logistics Information Technology capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

- This requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Force Program Executive Office - Business Enterprise Systems (AFPEO-BES) is evaluating systems under the DoDI 5000.75 to approve authorities to proceed (ATP) for each core logistics system remediation/modification project.

Agile development practices transform IT acquisitions by incrementally delivering capabilities faster and responding more effectively to changes in operations, technology, and budgets. The four objectives of Agile software development are: 1. Focusing on small, frequent capability releases; 2. Valuing working software over comprehensive documentation; 3. Responding rapidly to changes in operations, technology, and budgets; 4. Actively involving users throughout development to ensure high operational value.  In addition, exploitation of emerging cloud-native and containerized deployment on modern platforms will greatly enhance speed of delivery to users in a secure, scalable, and flexible manner.

The Logistics IT program utilizes the Agile software development methodology in the acquisition of these projects. LogIT supports multiple lines of effort and will employ multiple acquisition strategies to achieve the 3 LogIT objectives of FIAR and Software Upgrades, Transformation, and Transformation Capability Initiatives. Agile development, continuous integration and deployment are preferred methodologies that will be employed to the greatest extent possible to achieve maximum flexibility and cyber-resiliency, using an appropriate mix of contractor and government personnel. 

Contract strategies will require multiple approaches with a focus on best value and rapid execution using contracts like the pre-competed Small Business Enterprise Application Solutions (SBEAS) multi-vendor indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) vehicle.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) is the A4 reporting and analytics gateway providing a single "source of truth" via aggregated logistics data from numerous authoritative logistics systems using a wide range of analytic tools from streamlined, comprehensive dashboards to intricate, tailored adhoc reporting for multiple logistics mission areas including weapon systems, engines, support equipment, financials, maintenance, repair network, vehicles, and mobile. LIMS-EV delivers 20+ Business Intelligence capabilities to various logistics business areas by integrating data from 70+ systems with world-wide access by 30K+ users including decision makers at all AF levels (Flight, Squadron, Group, Wing, MAJCOM, COCOM).  

Projects currently in development include four new capabilities modernizing three views : (1) Weapon System Sustainment (WSS) Automation - 1.0, (2) Engines View 4.0 (ENG) (deployment),  (3) Supply Chain Management (SCM) - 8.0 DLA iPID/Serialized Control Total Asset Visibility.  These are being delivered using an Scaled Agile Framework.   Using Lean and Agile methodologies to efficiently manage and execute scope, three capabilities affecting two views have been pushed out and are planned to be delivered after FY20.  This includes (1) Vehicle View - 8.0 MELRAT and Virtual Parking Tool as well as (2) Support Equipment View (SEV) 2.0.

Future LIMS-EV modernization include federating/integrating LIMS-EV with the A4 enterprise Basing and Logistics Analytics Data Environment(BLADE), which will allow expansion of LOGCOP capability using LIMS-EV data.   Additionally, refactoring LIMS-EV using enterprise technical solutions will increase scalability and portability of LIMS-EV views by reducing reliance on legacy software applications which currently require separate licensing which increases cost and limits portability.   Asset Lifecycle Management Automation, Improved Supply Chain Visibility and End-to-End Maintenance Lifecycle Management are planned to deliver eight new capabilities to modernize six current views which targets 80% of current LIMS-EV users.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver our integrated logistics capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for all aircrew and parachutist management (including flight and jump pay) covering 65,000 Aircrew/Parachutists and used by 2,800 1C0X2 Career Field members with 2.2M transactions per week. The ARMS is a web-based on-line management information system designed to support the base level Director of Operations (DO), aircrew supervisors, and managers. ARMS provides management policies and ensures the status of the Air Force flying programs are available to flying/jump supervisors to make resource allocation decisions. ARMS ensures accurate tracking of flying and ground training programs for each weapon system at each base. ARMS provides accurate and timely aircrew/parachutist information which assists in monitoring, tracking, and scheduling military training required to meet Air Force mission requirements. Additionally, the ARMS manages flying hours for aircrew parachutists world-wide to include USAF, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG). 

The current ARMS functionality resides at a Defense Information System Agency (DISA) DECC and consists of "5” logical modules to include: Flight and Flying Hours, Individual Training, Jumper Aircrew, Resource Tracking, Reports, and System. The sustainment of these capabilities and the introduction of new capabilities follows an agile development process, but the effectiveness of that process is severely limited by the existing production environment.   

A portion of the ARMS Jumper Aircrew module capabilities are being migrated to a mandated government-approved cloud environment. The cloud environment provides the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline required to constantly deliver software in and agile framework, following the required DevSecOps methodology. The migration to the cloud environment and the DevSecOps methodology will transform ARMS into a scalable and flexible system capable of meeting all information requirements of the Aviation Resource Management community.  

Once the initial cloud ARMS Jumper Aircrew capability is established, all remaining legacy program capabilities and new program requirements will be incorporated into the ARMS product backlog and prioritized for migration/stand-up in the cloud program instance. The ARMS DISA legacy program will sundown, once all capabilities are successfully migrated to the cloud environment.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ARMS capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The ARMS utilizes a hybrid of the Agile and Waterfall development methodologies to incrementally develop and field enhancements to the existing system. The ARMS PMO utilizes military programmers for code development/sustainment and government civilians providing program management, engineering, and information technology support. The ARMS PMO receives development/sustainment support from the 402nd Software Engineering Group (SWEG) at Robins AFB via a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Additionally, the ARMS PMO has partnered with the USAF Business Enterprise Systems (BES) Directorate's Business Enterprise Systems Programming INovation (BESPIN) office to acquire contractor resources. BESPIN has acquired current contractor support via Other Transaction Authority (OTA). Follow-on acquisition support will either be accomplished via OTA or Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contracts awarded under Section 8a as small business set aside. 

The updated ARMS Flight and Flying Hours modules and the Training Management module will be fielded to legacy ARMS in FY20, along with the initial ARMS cloud capability. Once the Jump module capability is established in Cloud One, migration efforts will begin to transition all legacy ARMS capabilities to the Cloud One environment. Changes to the legacy baseline will be limited to patches, vulnerability mitigation, and required capability implementations during the migration. The legacy ARMS will be linked to the Cloud One instance throughout the migration effort, ensuring users a seamless single sign-on application with underlying capabilities existing in both legacy DISA and Cloud One.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) provides grants to the civilian academic community to conduct research on military and civilian equal opportunity issues using standard social science methodology and engineering analysis.  The research methodology and analysis includes developing a literature review proposing hypotheses and methods of research.  The grantee will then gather appropriate data, draw conclusions and present discussions, recommendations and reports based on their funding.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides for payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.  The Department of Labor (DOL) administers this program and charges the Department of the Air Force for its employee costs; therefore, this is a MUST PAY bill for Air Force.  The Program Element(PE) excludes manpower authorizations and costs. This PE is in Budget Activity 7 in support of payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to FECA under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions. PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies from on-premise data centers to a more sustainable cloud-based hosting solution and flexible services-based architecture as defined by the Defense Enterprise Service Management Framework (DESMF).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning
from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and reduced in-person interactions. PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies from on premises data centers to a more sustainable cloud-based hosting solution and flexible services-based architecture as defined by the Defense Enterprise Service Management Framework (DESMF). In addition, funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides for development and enhancement of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools for strategic planning, operational requirements, modernization and recapitalization of systems and programs, as well as the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) processes for the AF Analytic Community and Secretary of the Air Force Standard Analysis Toolkit in support of AF Senior Leadership. As new technologies are introduced to the battlefield (Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface-to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons, etc.) along with evolving warfighting techniques and support operations, the range of capabilities that needs to be covered by  analytic tools needs to expand as well. M&amp;S creation and enhancement can require extensive research in how to properly implement the emerging weapons capabilities as well as demand development of software techniques to implement the changes. Additionally, emerging and continuing focus areas such as Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and ISR demand specific tools of their own for new exploration and development. These focus areas require examination in isolation as well as cross-domain making the problem more complex and increasing the R&amp;D challenges to field new decision support tools.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY20, PE 0901554F, DEAMS, changed from PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development.
In FY20, Project 675178, DEAMS Continuous Capability Development, changed from Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System Increment 2 (DEAMS Inc 2).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element develops upgrades to existing financial management systems. These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.

There are four projects within this program element: Program and Budget Enterprise Services (PBES), Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM), Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1), and DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD), formally known as DEAMS Increment 2, prior to FY20.

PBES is a software development effort that will utilize a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to deliver budgeting and programming capability for the Air Force and will replace legacy systems (Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS), and Enhanced Tradespace Tool (ETT) that support the budget formulation and force programming process.

CEM is a knowledge-based study effort to improve Air Force-wide cost estimating by analyzing cost data and recommending changes to estimating models, methods, and tools.

DEAMS development will be governed in Capability Support Phase after Increment 1 Full Deployment (FD).

DEAMS is the Air Force's target core accounting and financial management solution and is a key component of the long-term business process improvements needed to sustain auditability and correct financial system weaknesses.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>PBES will be the single solution software development effort to deliver planning, programming, budgeting and execution (PPBE) capability for the United States Air Force. PBES will replace legacy systems such as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES), Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and the Enhanced Tradespace Tool (ETT), supporting the budget formulation and force programming process. Upon full deployment of PBES, the system will be compliant with the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) conventions, which will enable data standardization across the Department of Defense (DoD).

Utilizing Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), the Air Force has designated PBES as the solution to deliver traceability of financial data in support of the PPBE process. Through the use of BPR, PBES will address excessive overhead, outdated business practices and other time-consuming support activities. PBES will make the budget formulation process more efficient by incorporating business best practices, organizing programming and budgeting personnel, as well as utilizing current technology. PBES will also eliminate checks and balances required of older technology, taking advantage of automated reconciliation services. In addition, the solution will allow the use of Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) for data exposure, resulting in more timely and accurate budget submissions to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Congress, and other internal and external customers.

A Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product has been selected as the tool of choice which will require minor configuration changes to meet the stated user requirements. This strategy requires no code changes to the actual COTS product and will drive lower support costs along with making future requirements changes easier in the out-years.  Requirements will be satisfied through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced and made available to operational users after every sprint. The Integrated Product Office construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PBES is a Business Category (BCAT) III program following DOD 5000.75 BCAC policy. The PBES strategy, supported by all Stakeholders, employed an empowered joint Program Office, Functional Community, and Senior Stakeholder group to rapidly develop, test, and deploy the Air Forces Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) capability within two years. This strategy required mutual trust and risk acceptance by all parties to be successful. Thus far, this strategy has been highly successful delivering PBES capabilities ahead of schedule and substantially under budget.  

The first step in this strategy utilized early risk reduction efforts (sometimes referred to as "prototyping”) to prove the capability and contractors existed to meet user's needs. This was conducted using two 6-month contract vehicles which were both completed months early, delivering several hundred user requirements. The success of these efforts led to the strategy of selecting a COTS product called Oracle Hyperion and to hire a small-business system integrator (SI). The significance in both of these is that the COTS product and the SI have both already been deployed across commercial companies and multiple DoD agencies, thus reducing the risk for implementation by the Government.

Both contract awards for the SI and Oracle licenses were made in 1QFY2018, with substantial cost savings received by negotiating bulk license purchases for all AF users. The development strategy employs agile development methods creating 4-6 week "Sprint” releases to deploy capability rapidly with substantial user feedback along the way. Fourteen total Sprints were planned across two years in an attempt to match on-going Air Force PPBE cycles. As Sprints are developed and tested, they are then deployed for operational use.

MAJCOMs will first use PBES in October 2019, for their FY2022 POM development and then submit their budget requests up to the Air Staff for their review and creation of the Air Force FY2022 POM. Air Staff will primarily use PBES over the legacy system in April 2020, with continued use throughout the FY2022 POM cycle. In FY2018, the AF decided to accelerate the PBES Planning application, so AF Planners will first use PBES for the FY2022 Plan creation in Feb 2020.  While PBES will be continually updated throughout these two years, it is also the strategy to migrate all legacy system data into PBES in manageable packages across the two years.

Full deployment of PBES is on schedule to be completed in 2QFY2021. The success of this strategy can be attributed to mutual buy-in by all parties, risk acceptance that the solution will not be perfect from the start, and an understanding that not all requirements are exactly known up-front and that changes will be required continuously to be successful.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM) provides and enhances Air Force-wide cost estimating capabilities by developing current cost data and estimating methods and tools, data process reengineering, data structure development, and gap filling initiatives.  In collaboration with the OSD Cost Assessment Data Enterprise (CADE) project (DoD's unified initiative to collect, organize, store, and use data more efficiently), these products will improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the acquisition program cost estimates required by statute (e.g., 10 USC 2366, 2433, 2434) and policy directives (e.g., DoDI 5000.02) in support of AF and DoD acquisition decisions, programming and execution decisions, and Congressional mandates.   

CEM will ensure the Air Force continuously improves cost estimating capabilities for broad cross-cutting areas, as well as specific to each weapon system type (aircraft, UAVs, ballistic missiles, tactical missiles, munitions, electronics and aircraft modifications, ground stations and automated information systems, space and launch vehicles).  Changing technologies, acquisition laws, policy directives, and initiatives drive the need to revise cost estimating processes, methods, and tools.  For example, current capability shortfalls reflect gaps in the ability to respond effectively to the laws and regulations that drive increased cost estimating demands such as FY16/17/18 NDAA reports (PL 114-92/114-328/115-91--provisions relating to Major Defense Acquisition Programs (Section 804 of the FY16 NDAA authorized rapid prototyping and rapid fielding of defense systems), Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) (provisions related to improving cost estimating quality, especially earlier in the program life-cycle and affordability analysis), Secretary of the Air Force Acquisition Excellence Plan (priorities to improve cost estimating capability and affordability analysis and improved cost estimating support to requirements process), and Office of the Secretary of Defense policy (initiatives on enhanced trade-off analysis, affordability analysis, and will- versus should-cost analysis).  The CADE and CEM partnership is the lead example for better data initiatives designed as a response to Congressional expressed desire for better outcomes in acquisition.  The partnership provides data/analysis/methods/tools and institutional knowledge at the analysts' fingertips versus the status quo inefficient, ad hoc approach.

This project will perform knowledge-based studies to include analyzing historical data and changing technologies/programmatics to develop new estimating methods (e.g. statistical tools, cost estimating relationships) across hundreds of product work breakdown structure elements and functional cost elements within each weapon system type noted above.  Examples of areas of cost studies and modeling efforts that cut across all weapon system types are directed energy costs, software cost datasets and metrics; contract or engineering change order studies, analysis, and models; other government cost data, methods, and analysis tools (e.g., depot standup and government test); reliability and maintainability trends and impacts on cost; and fixed price contract performance.

CEM will deliver valuable analytical tools in support of higher quality/credible estimates (as required by statute and regulation) allowing for more realistic cost conscious decisions on over $100B of critical warfighter capability.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY2020, Project 675178, DEAMS Continuous Capability Development, changed from Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System Increment 2 (DEAMS Inc. 2).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.  

The remaining DEAMS Increment 1 development activities will be completed using agile software development methodologies under a project called DEAMS Rapid Acquisition.  As a Section 873 Agile Pilot program, Rapid Acquisition will also be a stepping stone in the implementation of agile development methodologies for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD).  Under Rapid Acquisition, the program contracted with a new System Integrator (SI) to sustain the DEAMS R12 baseline, develop the remaining Inc. 1 requirements (disbursing, reporting, Governance/Risk/Compliance (GRC)), and provide continual enhancement and improvement to the deployed system, utilizing agile software development.

DEAMS CCD capabilities will be implemented utilizing an agile software development methodology. Requirements for CCD include, but are not limited to, development of the core accounting and reporting functionality necessary to enable deployment of modernized personnel, contracting, and logistics systems. Additional capabilities under requirements definition include complex acquisition management, reimbursable cost accounting, military entitlement accounting, advanced accounting controls and audit sustainment, treasury cash accountability, and management accounting and billing for revolving funds. Included in these capabilities are selected requirements deferred from Increment 1. 

Requirements will be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced after every sprint. The PMO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.

Additional user deployments enabled by future increment capabilities include acquisition program executive offices; ranges, laboratories and test centers; and air logistics centers. These deployments will add an additional 4,600 users to the Inc 1 baseline for a total of 22,500 users.

This funding request will support development of the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) compliance information artifacts and plans necessary to support the program, Capability Process Maps (CPMs) for each business capability, and mapping of financial management processes the capability will require (Blueprinting). Additionally, the funding will support acquisition strategy planning by early identification/definition of Information Technology Functional Requirements (ITFRs) and Information Assets (IA), Acquisition Strategy Determination, Solution Approach, and Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation. 

Funds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>DEAMS CCD system capabilities will be developed and enhanced through completion of development sprint cycles in accordance with an agile software development strategy. DEAMS expects to leverage lessons learned during the Increment I rapid acquisition to develop a T&amp;E process that is more complimentary to the Agile software development process. Development activities include requirements analysis, design, build, test, data conversion, cut-over from legacy systems, and the resolution of deficiency reports and defects. Also includes the support services (product development support, solution architecture support, configuration control and management support, quality assurance support, acquisition strategy support, test planning support, and cybersecurity support) of various Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;ASs), Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD) acquisition strategy will leverage experience gained from FY2019 NDAA Section 869 Pilot Program activities and from agile software development efforts in Increment 1. CCD will be implemented using an agile methodology approach following the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC). DEAMS will be in the Capability Sustainment Phase 5 (per DOD Instruction 5000.75) and will conduct continual enhancement/process improvements for the life of the program. DEAMS will continue technical support services for requirements definition and analysis and System Integrator request for proposal (RFP) development, and continue acquisition planning and support for first set of agile development epics supporting CCD system capabilities.

CCD will deliver functionality at earliest opportunity on a stable Increment 1 baseline. User experience and mission impact will be taken into account when establishing the release battle rhythm to the operational system. Factors for software releases include:
- Budget formulation and justification cycles
- End of year financial closeout
- Interdependencies with enterprise business systems
- Higher DOD requirements
- On-going development efforts with LOG-IT, CON-IT, MRO, AFIPPS, and other legacy systems
- Interfaces/data standards changes
- Changes to hosting, deployment technologies, or strategies to optimize system security, performance, and cost savings</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2020, PE 0901554F, DEAMS, changes from PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS user deployments include:
- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
- U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio
- Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) (Incremental Deployments)
- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs
 
On 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increment. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Inc 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Force in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (FD ATP) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. (FD ATP date is August 2020 and Capability Support Authority to Proceed (CS ATP) date is February 2021.)

The remaining DEAMS Inc 1 schedule includes the Oracle e-Business Suite R12 upgrade and development and deployment of the remaining Increment 1 capabilities (disbursing, reporting, and Governance/Risk/Compliance (GRC)), as well as enhancements and improvements to the existing baseline.  In accordance with the FY2019 NDAA, DEAMS is an Agile Pilot program as defined in Sec 873 of the FY2018 NDAA, and all remaining development will be accomplished using agile software development methodologies.

DEAMS Inc 1 is developing capability which allows for deployment to the remaining user locations.  However, DEAMS has also begun transitioning the support of previously deployed locations to the Operation and Support (O&amp;S) phase.

Funds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DEAMS Inc 1 is over 87% deployed as the baseline viable product for the AF operational finance community. The program relies on heavy customer involvement through the functional management office to govern system changes, requirements development, and day-to-day customer support. DEAMS will employ multiple contract actions as the various Development Activities and Releases are developed, tested, and deployed through FY 2020.

DEAMS Inc 1 accelerated deployment to Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Education &amp; Training Command (AETC), and AF Reserve Command (AFRC) tenant users from FY2020 to FY2019. This user base was orphaned from ACC, AETC, and AFRC because they reside on bases owned by other Major Commands.

AF Space Command and AF Materiel Command Incremental users at the base operations level will migrate to DEAMS Inc 1 capability in FY2020 as planned.

In the FY2019 NDAA, DEAMS was selected as an FY2018 NDAA Sec 873 Agile Pilot program.  To facilitate the transition from traditional to agile software development, Increment 1 development items will be completed under a new rapid acquisition contract action using agile software development methods. This new effort will also inform and facilitate the agile program implementation for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2020, PE 0901554F, DEAMS, changed from PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development.
In FY2020, Project 675178, DEAMS Continuous Capability Development, changed from Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System Increment 2 (DEAMS Inc. 2).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element develops upgrades to existing financial management systems. These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.

There are two projects within this program element: Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1), and DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD), formerly known as DEAMS Increment 2. Project 675178: DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD) started in FY2019 under PE 0901538F. Project 675179: DEAMS Increment 1 was under PE 0901538F through FY2019.

The Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. The DEAMS implementation will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). DEAMS is a key enabler and provides the core accounting system for all enterprise business system development necessary to sustain financial statement auditability.

DEAMS enhancements will be governed in Capability Support Phase after Increment 1 Full Deployment (FD).

DEAMS is the Air Force's target core accounting and financial management solution and is a key component of the long-term business process improvements needed to sustain auditability and correct financial system weaknesses.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver accounting and financial management capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $11.378 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY2020, Project 675178, DEAMS Continuous Capability Development, changed from Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System Increment 2 (DEAMS Inc. 2).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

The remaining DEAMS Increment 1 development activities will be completed using agile software development methodologies under a project called DEAMS Rapid Acquisition.  In FY2019, DEAMS CCD was added to the FY2018 NDAA, as a Section 873 Agile Pilot program; Rapid Acquisition will also be a stepping stone in the implementation of agile development methodologies for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD).  Under Rapid Acquisition, the program contracted with a new System Integrator (SI) to sustain the DEAMS R12 baseline, develop the remaining Inc. 1 requirements (disbursing, reporting, Governance/Risk/Compliance (GRC)), and provide continual enhancement and improvement to the deployed system, utilizing agile software development.

DEAMS CCD capabilities will be implemented utilizing an agile software development methodology. Requirements for CCD include, but are not limited to, development of the core accounting and reporting functionality necessary to enable deployment of modernized personnel, contracting, and logistics systems. Additional capabilities under requirements definition include complex acquisition management, reimbursable cost accounting, military entitlement accounting, advanced accounting controls and audit sustainment, treasury cash accountability, and management accounting and billing for revolving funds. Included in these capabilities are selected requirements deferred from Increment 1. 

Requirements will be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced after every sprint. The PMO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.

Additional user deployments enabled by future increment capabilities include acquisition program executive offices; ranges, laboratories and test centers; and air logistics centers. These deployments will add an additional 4,600 users to Inc 1 baseline for a total of 22,500 users.

This funding request will support development of the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) compliant information artifacts and plans necessary to support the program, Capability Process Maps (CPMs) for each business capability, and mapping of financial management processes the capability will require (Blueprinting). Additionally, the funding will support acquisition strategy planning by early identification/definition of Information Technology Functional Requirements (ITFRs) and Information Assets (IA), Acquisition Strategy Determination, Solution Approach, and Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation.

Funds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities. Additional activities also include studies and analysis to support both program planning and execution.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver accounting and financial management capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD) acquisition strategy will leverage experience gained from FY2019 NDAA Section 869 Pilot Program activities and from agile software development efforts in Increment 1. CCD will be implemented using an agile methodology approach following the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC). DEAMS will conduct continual enhancement/process improvements for the life of the program. DEAMS will continue technical support services for requirements definition and analysis and System Integrator request for proposal (RFP) development, and continue acquisition planning and support for first set of agile development epics supporting CCD system capabilities.

CCD will deliver functionality at earliest opportunity on a stable Increment 1 baseline. User experience and mission impact will be taken into account when establishing the release battle rhythm to the operational system. Factors for software releases include:
- Budget formulation and justification cycles
- End of year financial closeout
- Interdependencies with enterprise business systems
- Higher DOD requirements
- On-going development efforts with LOG-IT, CON-IT, MRO, and AFIPPS
- Interfaces/data standards changes
- Changes to hosting, deployment technologies, or strategies to optimize system security, performance, and cost savings</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2020, PE 0901554F, DEAMS, changed from PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS user deployments include:
- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
- U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio
- Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) (Incremental Deployments)
- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs

On 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increments. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Inc 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Force in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (FD ATP) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. (FD ATP date is August 2020 and Capability Support Authority to Proceed (CS ATP) date is February 2021.)

The remaining DEAMS Inc 1 schedule includes the Oracle e-Business Suite R12 upgrade and development and deployment of the remaining Increment 1 capabilities (disbursing, reporting, and Governance/Risk/Compliance (GRC)), as well as enhancements and improvements to the existing baseline.  In accordance with the FY2019 NDAA, DEAMS is an Agile Pilot program as defined in Sec 873 of the FY2018 NDAA, and all remaining development will be accomplished using agile software development methodologies.

DEAMS Inc 1 is developing capability which allows for deployment to the remaining user locations. However, DEAMS has also begun transitioning previously deployed locations to the Operation and Support (O&amp;S) phase.

Funds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver accounting and financial management capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>DEAMS Inc 1 capability development activities support multiple software releases and user deployments as described in the mission description. Development activities include design, build, test, data conversion, reporting, cutover from legacy systems, and the resolution of deficiency reports and defects.
Activities also include hardware support (system administration and database security) and storage service by Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA); continued development of interface to Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF); Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Common Computing Environment (CCE); Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V); Developmental Release Field Support (DRFS) to include process execution and data scripts; help desk support; Engineering Integration Services (EIS) for oversight of development tools and processes; deployment training and change management activities. Provides acquisition, contract, finance, and cost management planning and Program Management Administration (PMA) utilizing an agile approach for reporting, disbursing, and auditing initiatives.
Develop, using an Agile software development approach, the Disbursing Initiative (includes modernizing disbursing and implementing daily reconciliation with the U.S. Treasury, which will manage the receipt and acceptance of agreements, orders, and invoices), the Reporting Initiative (establish a modernized Business Intelligence reporting solution), and the Segregation of Duties (SOD) Initiative (allow DEAMS to meet regulatory compliance requirements associated with Financial Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM)).

FY2019 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

                                <r2:Description>The T&amp;E process will be a complete system operational test to determine DEAMS effectiveness, suitability, and mission capability using the R12 Upgrade. It begins with validation of requirements and end to end functional capabilities including compliance mandates. The T&amp;E effort are conducted in developer sites, Air Force test sites, DISA production sites, and user locations. The DEAMS Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), Lead Developmental Test Organization (LDTO) Integrated Test Plan (ITP), System Integrators (SIs) Software Test Plans (STPs), and Operational Test Agency (OTA) operational test plans covers the details of Increment 1 T&amp;E. Database Administrator (DBA) Test Support required to service test instances. Capabilities Integration Environment (CIE) Integration/Development support for ancillary Test activities required. Hardware and software required for test activities.
The T&amp;E effort for the Agile Pilot Program includes Sprint Testing where functionality developed code in the sprint is tested for conformance to functional and non-functional requirements. Sprint Testing shall address unit and integrated testing.  Additionally, there will be Regression Testing to validate that the work within the sprint has not introduced defects into areas of the product not directly impacted by the work of the sprint and has not introduced defects into cross-product dependencies such as interfaces.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DEAMS Inc 1 is over 87% deployed as the baseline viable product for the AF operational finance community. The program relies on heavy customer involvement through the functional management office to govern system changes, requirements development, and day-to-day customer support. DEAMS will employ multiple contract actions as the various Development Activities and Releases are developed, tested, and deployed through FY2020.

DEAMS Inc 1 accelerated deployment to Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Education &amp; Training Command (AETC), and AF Reserve Command (AFRC) tenant users from FY2020 to FY2019. This user base was orphaned from ACC, AETC, and AFRC only because they reside on bases owned by other Major Commands.

AF Space Command and AF Materiel Command Incremental users at the base operations level will migrate to DEAMS Inc 1 capability in FY2020 as planned.

In the FY2019 NDAA, DEAMS was nominated to be an FY2018 NDAA Sec 873 Agile Pilot program.  To facilitate the transition from traditional to agile software development, Increment 1 development items will be completed under a new rapid acquisition contract action using agile software development methods. This new effort will also inform and facilitate the agile program implementation for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2021, PE 1201017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1201017SF Global Sensor Integrated on Network from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force. 

$1.889M is included in FY 2021 in this request for Appropriation 3600, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Air Force, PE 1201017F; these funds should have been requested under Appropriation 3620 Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1201017SF. Justification and plans for these funds are included in PE 1201017SF, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), R-1 Line #26.

The missions of USSPACECOM and USSTRATCOM include establishing and providing full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. 

The Nation's strategic C2 sensors, and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. GSIN developed and established a unified schema that integrates disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single, exposed data set, providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership. GSIN also enables existing radars and sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning, execution, and future program planning.

GSIN directly supports USSPACECOM, USSTRATCOM and other Combatant Command and MAJCOM mission sets. GSIN meshes together selected systems and sensors (from tactical to strategic), including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility, and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Repurposing these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. GSIN enables creation of a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing realtime collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. GSIN also improves Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability and provides this data for the larger space order of battle capabilities. GSIN dramatically improves the ingestion of nontraditional, but readily available, non-US government and commercial data to the United States Space Force (USSF) satellite catalog. GSIN addresses NORTHCOM/STRATCOM's signed Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) ST-0010 request for uninterrupted traditional and non-traditional sensor data integration and the Global Threat Characterization Assessment (GTCA) Operational Planning Team report. GSIN provides critical and unique data to the USSPACECOM SSA data repositories to facilitate the large Space Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) suite of capabilities/programs. Finally, GSIN provides Machine Learner and Data Analysis functions to optimize and operate situational awareness in the field.

Space Acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GSIN weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F,0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Beginning in FY20, the Space Analysis and Application Development program and the Joint Navigation Warfare Center will be reported under the newly created PE 1202140F, USSPACECOM.  Leaving only the Data Integration and Fusion Center and the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program being reported under PE 1201921F.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The USSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace. Funds are necessary to update current government-owned software to ingest and disseminate new data sources from Title 10 and Title 50 sensors.  The DIFC efforts at COCOM sponsored experimentation events will inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations.

Mission Assurance (MA) is a DoD risk management effort, driven by DODD 3020.40 that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions.  "DoD will continue, under the MA construct and policy, existing efforts to meet national and Defense Critical Infrastructure (DCI) requirements established by PPD-21.  Existing Department-level Defense Critical Infrastructure Program policy will remain effective until integrated into, replaced, or rescinded by MA policy.  DoD Components will maintain sufficient resources to meet DCI responsibilities for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risk to critical infrastructure and align associated security, protection, and risk management efforts under an MA construct.”  Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links.

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY19 funding increased by $14.475 due to Joint Urgent Operational Need reprogramming.

In FY20 the decrease is associated with the funding for the Joint Navigation Warfare Center, and the USSTRATCOM Space Modeling and Simulation moving into the newly created USSPACECOM PE 1202140F. The only RDT&amp;E funding remaining in 1201921F will be for the Data Integration and Fusion Center (~$500K per year) and the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) ($488K in FY20).</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ScheduleDetailNote>Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) conducts PRISM, FORTUNE, and GYPSY operational field assessments on an on-going, annual basis.

PRISM events encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific Combatant Command and/or Service exercise or mission event.  

FORTUNE events are Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) vulnerability field assessments and are small scale technical risk assessments or can be risk reduction events for larger GYPSY events.

GYPSY events are larger than FORTUNE PNT related events and involve other coalition partners, and multiple US services in direct support of Geographic Combatant Command requirements. 

JNWC uses the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) program, administered by USD (AT&amp;L). Requirements dictate which MRTFB facility will be contracted to host a GYPSY or FORTUNE event.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Prior to the FY20 PB cycle, The Space Analysis and Application Development Program (WSC 67A011) and the Joint Navigation and Warfare Center (WSC 672486) were reported under PE 1201921F, Service Support to STRATCOM - Space Activities.  Beginning in FY20, the programs will be reported under the newly created PE 1202140F, Service Support to U.S. SPACECOM Activities</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Analysis and Application Development program integrates space based effects into Department's ‘Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&amp;S tools. Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations.

Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  Funds are used to create and maintain NAVWAR knowledge. NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs). GYPSY POFA's are linked to Combatant Commander's (CCMD) Tier 1 exercises (USSTRATCOM's Global Lightning and Global Thunder are examples) and provide operational realistic threat-representative, GPS-contested environments for analytical assessment of air, ground, maritime, space &amp; cyberspace mission capability.  FORTUNE POFAs are PNT capability and vulnerability assessments associated with a Service exercise or mission event.  PRISM POFAs encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific CCMD and/or service exercises or mission events.  Assessments inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations in the anticipated theater NAVWAR threat environments. JNWC assesses Department wide PNT posture through the PNT Annual assessment IAW DoDI 4650.08.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This is NOT a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Analysis and Application Development program Integrates space based effects into Department's ‘Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&amp;S tools. Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Continue priority integration of 22 Joint Mission Threads, space-based capabilities, and counter-space effects on the Warfighter in STORM

- Continue to develop change request proposals and submit to STORM Configuration Control Board (CCB) to improve instantiation of potential future and denied/degraded space-based capabilities and their effects on the Warfighter in STORM

- In coordination with HAF A/9 (HQ Air Force Studies, Analysis, and Assessments), develop schedule to identify requirements toward implementation of approved change requests and instantiation of space and contested space capabilities in STORM

- Develop and modify user-friendly, front-end campaign-level M&amp;S software and tools supporting sufficiently accurate and very timely exploratory analytics to optimize more costly campaign-level STORM M&amp;S, operational planning, gaming, and concept development 

- Continue development of software and tools to model Red on Blue contested space (one versus one, many versus many, and space campaign-level) and analyze/assess results to determine impact/effects on U.S. military campaigns and global operations

- Coordinate and update current and future Blue space order of battle data, Red counter-space order of battle data, Red counter-space CONOPS, future Blue and Red CONOPs to support integration of contested space into mission and campaign-level M&amp;S

- Continue updates to software, tools, models, and data at the mission- and campaign-level to inform senior leaders evolving inquiries and decisions on space investments, requirements, acquisition, operational COAs, operational risk, and future planning

- Assess and integrate enterprise-level model data for SATCOM capabilities into campaign-level modeling

- In coordination with European Command, Indo-Pacific Command, other combatant commands, and respective USSPACECOM Integrated Planning Elements; explore improved integrated risk analysis with new campaign-level M&amp;S capabilities

- Utilize updated tools and data to support analytical efforts in support of SPACECOM activities, new Space Analysis Consortium, and evolving space analytical capabilities; and collaborate with partners to inform senior leader forums and decisions on space investments, requirements, acquisition, and operational risk decisions

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force TENCAP increases warfighter effectiveness through the exploitation of national capabilities and promotes cross-domain integration of these capabilities into military operations/training and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities.

AF TENCAP exploits existing air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR) for operational and tactical applications by rapidly prototyping and providing capability demonstrations. Projects are designed to transition to warfighters or national intelligence agencies for operational use, and to appropriate acquisition Programs of Record for sustainment and further development. AF TENCAP projects influence the design and operation of current and future air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and NTISR systems while providing situational awareness to warfighters, national intelligence agency organizations, and units.

The program consists of multiple small projects supporting one of the Air Force Core Function Mission Areas (CFMAs). Projects are executed to provide continued support to Special Operations Forces and the warfighter, with impacts at the national, operational, and tactical levels.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF TENCAP capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Projects are selected based upon needs identified by the program's customers - DOD Departments, Combatant Commands, Components, MAJCOMs, and/or National Intelligence Agencies. Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via AF TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements. The U.S. Government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, sustainment and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by AF TENCAP.

AF TENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. AF TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program teams to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue the following segment which mitigates cost and schedule risk.

Contracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE 1203001F, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203001SF, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 7 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

The FAB-T project replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC). FAB-T will provide the new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, and AEHF Satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar and AEHF satellite constellations. The Air Force will continue development of the FAB-T Command Post Terminal(CPT), performing activities to meet current and future emerging SATCOM requirements.

The Force Element Terminal (FET) project provides secure, protected, and survivable communications for the strategic and tactical warfighter through airborne based MILSATCOM terminals. The FET will provide the B-52, and RC-135 aircraft with worldwide nuclear and non-nuclear survivable, anti-jam Low Probability of Detect (LPD)/Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), data and voice communications. The FET will be interoperable with Milstar, AEHF, Enhanced Polar Systems - Recapitalization (EPS-R), and Evolved Strategic SATCAM (ESS) Satellite constellations utilizing both Low Data Rate (LDR) and Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveforms.

The PNVC capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) System. PNVC is the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN) replacement capability which provides anti-jam, anti-scintillation, survivable, and endurable voice communications through the AEHF satellite system for national and strategic users. There are several components being developed and procured by other organizations that must be synchronized to expeditiously field the capability. The PNVC Integrator is responsible for end-to-end integration of these components, to include requirements traceability, end-to-end system testing, configuration and checkout activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identification of deficiencies in overall PNVC system capability, enterprise and life cycle support for PNVC components. The AFPEO-SP approved entry into the acquisition lifecycle as post MS-A ACAT III Program of Record in January 2016. Starting in December 2018 PNVC Integrator is responsible for all program elements' requests for funding related to the Defense Information Systems and Agency (DISA) components of the PNVC System in accordance with FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Sec. 1661.

In February 2019 the AFPEO/NC declared the PNVC Integrator an ACAT II Program based on the updated approved budget request.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver FAB-T weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE 1203001F, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203001SF, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 7 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

In FY 2020 PE 1203001F, Project 672490, transferred to PE 1203001F, Project 673035 for PNVC and Project 673040 for FET for program transparency. 

The FAB-T program replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC).  FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF and EPS satellite constellations. The Air Force will continue development of the FAB-T Command Post Terminal (CPT), performing systems engineering, architecture studies, development &amp; operational test efforts, FAB-T terminal interoperability with the full AEHF satellite constellation activities, and other program activities to meet current and future emerging SATCOM requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FAB-T Acquisition Strategy:  In FY 2012, the government restructured the FAB-T development program to introduce competition into the acquisition strategy in order to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. To ensure the best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon). The production contracts began with production planning for both contractors. In June 2014, the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon. Development and production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals continued with Raytheon. The first Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised after a successful Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE 1203001F, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203001SF, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity [07] due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

In FY 2020 PE 1203001F, the PNVC effort in Project 672490 transferred to PE 1203001F, Project 673035, PNVC, for additional transparency. 

The PNVC capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) System. PNVC is the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN) replacement capability which provides anti-jam, anti-scintillation, survivable, and endurable voice communications through the AEHF satellite system for national and strategic users.  There are several components being developed and procured by other organizations that must be synchronized to expeditiously field this capability.  The PNVC Integrator is responsible for end-to-end integration of these components, to include requirements traceability, end-to-end system testing, configuration and checkout activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identification of deficiencies in overall PNVC system capability, enterprise and life cycle support for PNVC components.  The AFPEO/SP approved entry into the acquisition lifecycle as a post MS-A ACAT III Program of Record in January 2016.  In February 2019 the AF PEO/NC declared the PNVC Integrator an ACAT II Program based on updated approved budget request. 

Starting in December 2018, PNVC Integrator is responsible for all program elements' requests for funding related to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) components of the PNVC System in accordance with FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Sec. 1661.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver PNVC weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>PNVC Integrator government team will conduct Phase 1 Developmental Test for ground based systems, with prime contractor support. In parallel, prime contractor and component contractors will identify and resolve hardware and software deficiencies identified during risk reduction testing, and conduct regression and interoperability testing post-disposition using both contractor and government test laboratories. Prime contractor will also be conducting Phase 2 risk reduction and contractor test for two airborne and a SMART-T nodes, and executing integration and checkout of PNVC systems at ground fixed locations world-wide. Finally, government and contract teams will conduct technical order verification and conducting user training across all nodes and sites.

Continue program office and other related support activities that may include, but are not limited to studies, technical analysis, experimentation, prototyping, etc.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PNVC Acquisition Strategy:  On May 15, 2015 the Deputy Secretary of Defense assigned the PNVC End-to-End Integration responsibility to the Air Force; effective May 16, 2015, SAF/AQ designated the AFPEO/SP. In February 2019 the AF PEO/NC declared the PNVC Integrator an ACAT II Program based on updated approved budget request. The PNVC End-to-End Integrator program is responsible for requirements traceability, End-to-End system testing, site configuration activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identifying deficiencies in the PNVC capability, and enterprise and life cycle support for all PNVC components. Starting in December 2018 PNVC Integration is responsible for all program elements' requests for funding related to the Defense Information Systems and Agency (DISA) components of the PNVC System in accordance with FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Sec. 1661.

Beginning in FY2020, all PNVC funds were transferred from DISA to BPAC 673035, for execution.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE 1203001F, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203001SF, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity [07] due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

In FY 2020, PE 1203001F, Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, Project 673040, Force Element Terminal efforts were transferred from PE 1203001F, PE Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, Project 672490, Family of Advanced Beyond Line of Sight Terminals to provide program transparency.

The Force Element Terminal (FET) program provides secure, protected, and survivable communications for the strategic and tactical warfighter through airborne based MILSATCOM terminals.  The FET  will provide the B-52, and RC-135 aircraft with worldwide nuclear and non-nuclear survivable, anti-jam, Low Probability of Detect (LPD)/Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), data and voice communications. The FET will be interoperable with Milstar, AEHF, Enhanced Polar Systems - Recapitalization (EPS-R), and Evolved Strategic SATCOM (ESS) Satellite constellations utilizing both Low Data Rate (LDR) and Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveforms.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver FAB-T FET weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE 1203110F, Satellite Control Network (SPACE) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203110SF Satellite Control Network (SPACE] from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

FY 2020 received a Congressional mark that reduces DCO-S by -$5M for unjustified request.  That reduction was not accounted for correctly in the database and reflected a -$4M reduction.  The correct total for AFSCN in FY 2020 is $56.891M, not $57.891M.

The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB &amp; Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS) and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for over 170 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Missile Warning, Communications, Weather, Launch Vehicle Support, and Research and Development (R&amp;D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 490 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control. During FY 2019 the AFSCN supported 11 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $4.1B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. In FY 2019, the AFSCN supported 19 launches delivering $13.7B worth of satellites to their operational orbits. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence Community, and civil users. These efforts support cyber hardening, Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO-S) and and Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) activities for the space enterprise, as well as align with the evolving future space domain demands through Resilient Enterprise Ground (REG) to include transmit and receive, and data transport.

AFSCN Deficiency Resolution: Provides test, cyber security, requirements management, and system architecture support to the AFSCN.  

Resilient Enterprise Ground (REG): Provides the means to communicate with all future spacecraft through diverse communication networks. The program is pursuing more capable ground based antennas, space based communication links, augmenting the existing ASFCN with commercial and civil antennas, upgrading satellite scheduling to commercial standards, and developing infrastructure for long haul communications driven by increase in antennas, cyber security and resilience requirements. 

In FY 2021, Defensive Cyber Operations Space (DCO-S) funds in PE 1203614F JSpOC Mission System moved to PE 1203110F Satellite Control Network to consolidate Air Force Space DCO-S development activities.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program /project priorities according to an integrated unclassified /classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or re-purpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFSCN weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

Funding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in PE 0305110F Satellite Control Network.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2020, funding for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) Project 673140 was transferred to a dedicated Program Element (1206770F).
In FY2021, PE 1203173F, Space and Missile Test and Evaluation Center efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203173SF Space and Missile Test and Evaluation Center from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Innovation and Prototyping Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support of prototype experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites at the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) and the Mobile Range Flight (MRF) at Kirtland, NM and at Schriever AFB, CO. The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions. The RDSMO program is responsible for transitions of designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs. In addition, RDSMO supports the deployment and sustainment of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations as AFSPC transitions to an Enterprise-based ground C2. Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.

The primary objective of the MMSOC C2/GSE environment is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D, prototype and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard hardware and software infrastructure to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations;(3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new satellite and C2 systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and legacy satellite missions. A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon and to meet the evolving initiatives of the current and future space enterprise.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified /classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanism to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop
new, or repurpose capabilities.

This program may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver warfighting space capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Innovation and Prototyping Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support of prototype experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites at the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) and the Mobile Range Flight (MRF) at Kirtland, NM and at Schriever AFB, CO. The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions and transitions designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs.  In addition, RDSMO supports the deployment and sustainment of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations as US Space Force (USSF) HQ transitions to an Enterprise-based ground C2.  Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line in appropriation 3021, Space Procurement Air Force, procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.

The primary objective of the MMSOC C2/GSE environment is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D, prototype and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard hardware and software infrastructure to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations;(3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new satellite and C2 systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and legacy satellite missions. A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon and to meet the evolving initiatives of the current and future space enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) program is part of the evolving current and future space domain demands. MMSOC capability will transition to become the EGS command and control (C2) product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and  resiliency in space program ground systems. The EGS capability will become the primary ground C2 system for US Space Force (USSF) HQ and other users.

The main objective of the EGS is to provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems. EGS will focus efforts on developing and integrating data centers in laboratories at three separate sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cybersecurity development and implementation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) provides the Air Force with a robust enterprise ground architecture by creating a set of government standards and interfaces to flexibly manage and execute integrated and agile satellite operations (SATOPS) in a contested environment. EGS provides the complete operations solution for SATOPS at various classification levels with increased resiliency and capability, and improved cyber defense capabilities. EGS will enable a near-real-time common operating picture of enterprise-wide tactical health, status and indications, and warnings for Air Force satellites. The end-state will be a modern technical infrastructure which is cyber- secure and resilient against the Advanced Persistent Threat and employs streamlined architecting, acquisition, and operational processes. EGS operates as a key element of the current and future space domain, and leverages lessons learned, contracts and resources from the other elements of the Enterprise Space Battle Management Command and Control (ESBMC2) and Threat Warning and Response (TWAR).</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The EGS acquisition strategy focuses on rapidly delivering C2 prototypes and operational capabilities to warfighters, while leveraging industry best practices for agile development and continuous integration /deliver (CI/CD). One of the key tenets of the EGS acquisition strategy is to maintain government ownership of the technical baseline. As a result, EGS uses a combination of existing and new contracts, and agreements with industry and academia to procure prototypes, platform as a service (PaaS) capabilities, system engineering services, and pre-operations support for mission users. Leverage existing contracts in FY19 and continue consolidation of contracts into FY 2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2021, PE 1203174F, Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203174SF, Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

Located at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development (SIIRTD) program develops and modifies modeling and simulation tools that Air Force Space Command's Space Analysis Center uses for operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Development activities incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current. Space Training Simulators develop and upgrades space training emulators using Standard Space Trainer (SST) to meet Space Mission Force (SMF) threat-based, advanced training requirements as well as funds connection to Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) training networks. Finally, its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.  

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SIIRTD weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2020, Integrated Broadcast Service PE1203179F effort transfer to PE0305179F due to realignment to Major Force Program for Intelligence and Communications.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The IBS fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.

IBS is comprised of the following:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF (Ultra High Frequency) satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a Military Standard (MIL-STD) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 
- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), all built to validated warfighter requirements.
-- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

This PE funds:
- Development/upgrades of IBS (IBS-NS, CIB, and CMF) 

This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver IBS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE 1203182F, Spacelift Range System,(Space) efforts were transferred to Appropriations 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203182SF Spacelift Range System (Space) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriations for Space Force.

FY 2020 received a Congressional mark that increases by $10M for space launch services.  That increase and enacted request was not accounted for correctly in the database and reflected a -$15M overall reduction.  The correct total for LTRS in FY 2020 is $20.837M, not $5.837M.

The Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), provides public safety and assured access to space.  LTRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA. LTRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests.  LTRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely; together with national security space launch capability, LTRS provides assured access to space for the nation.  The ER and WR are designated as Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB).

LTRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data.  The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing &amp; Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.

The Air Force requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct digital data processing and transport prototype and proof of concept projects supporting Range of the Future (ROTF) launch operations. Funds will provide engineering and analysis to develop promising technology and validate LTRS architecture ability to meet the accelerating National launch requirement and introduce advanced data transport formats. These include demonstration of virtualized and remote data processing as well as dispersed and disaggregated flight tracking. 

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver LTRS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

Funding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in PE 0305182F, Space Lift Range System.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Due to fielded LTRS age and obsolescence issues, many systems need to be replaced (e.g. communications systems at ER and WR). These major modifications will be competed, typically among small business contractors, and selected through best value source selections. The competitively-selected SE&amp;I contractor manages government controlled requirements and processes as well as provide support to the "government as the integrator" between LTRS Integrated Support Contract (LISC) and separately competed modernization projects. FFRDC provides mission assurance oversight to ensure capabilities meet operational need.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE 1203265F, GPS III Space Segment efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203265SF GPS III Space Segment from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 7 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common-grid three- dimensional positioning/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures, and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec. 50112, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitate international cooperation.

The system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under Program Element (PE) 1203164F), Space (funded under this PE and PE 1203269F) and a Control Network (funded under PE 1203165F and PE 1206423F). The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals that are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. The user equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters (spherical error probable) worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.

GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) supporting the GPS constellation and is funded in PE 1203265F. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, and enhanced anti-jam power. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production and Deployment Phase.

PE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of GPS III SVs 01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This PE includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect United States (U.S.) military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).

Starting in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, PE 1203269F funded the RDT&amp;E of GPS IIIF (SVs 11-12), which included Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support efforts. GPS IIIF includes design activity, risk-reducing simulators, and systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS IIIF SVs, including backward compatibility, dual band Telemetry, Tracking, and Control (TT&amp;C), integration of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hosted payloads, a new  international civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, and the Regional Military Protection (RMP) capability that provides the ability to deliver high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals in specific areas of intended effect.

Mission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to and after launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures and procurement of special support equipment.

GPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet the congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchases to M-Code-capable receivers starting in FY 2017. Funds in this PE will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with OCX, supports Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.

Impacts of the M-Code deployment include:
-Compliance with The Air Force Space Command Commander's mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for early M-Code operational use and verification of Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) effects.
-Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.
-Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and properly deployed.
-Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding.

The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded by this budget item will determine whether an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GPS III Space Segment weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.

This PE encompasses the GPS III (SVs 01-10), COps, MCEU, M-Code Hosted Payload, and prior to FY 2019, GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) Production Readiness efforts.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Space Analysis and Application Development M-Code Hosted Payload will provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current GPS satellite constellation. The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses funded in this project will determine whether an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance and resiliency through redundant systems not directly connected with the current GPS satellite constellation. This augmentation to the GPS constellation enables future rapid technology on-ramps with minimal risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS III is the next-generation SV supporting the GPS constellation and is funded in PE 1203265F. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, and enhanced anti-jam power. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production and Deployment Phase.

PE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports RDT&amp;E of GPS III SVs 01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This program includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS OCX program.

Mission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch and post launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures and procurement of special support equipment.

GPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet a congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchase to M-Code capable receivers starting in FY 2017. The funds will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with GPS OCX, supports MGUE testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.

Impacts of the M-Code deployment include:
-Compliance with The Air Force Space Command Commander's mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for early M-code operational use and verification of NAVWAR effects.
-Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.
-Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and properly deployed.
-Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding.

The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded by this budget item will determine whether an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation.

This PE encompasses the GPS III (SVs 01-10), COps, MCEU, M-Code Hosted Payload, and prior to FY2019, GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) Production Readiness efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The GPS III SVs will have GPS IIF capabilities plus up to a 3x-8x increase in anti-jam signal power, 3x improved accuracy, 3+ year increased design life, a new international civil (L1C) signal compatible with the European Galileo system, and a satellite bus capable of supporting future SV capability additions.

RDT&amp;E funding for SVs 11 and 12 is in PE 1203269F and PE 1203269SF, Project GPS IIIF. Procurement funding for SVs 13-32 is captured in PE 1203269F and PE 1203269SF, Project GPS IIIF.

The AF is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort is funded with AFRL's S&amp;T funding and PE 1203265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads and inform future PNT architectures.

On 19 July 2016, PEO Space approved the Acquisition Strategy Document (ASD) for the COps effort. The strategy enables contingency constellation sustainment capability for GPS III PNT. GPS III COps is needed because GPS OCX will not deliver in time to support initial GPS III SV operations. COps operates (post-launch and check-out) GPS III SVs at the capability level of GPS IIR-M or GPS IIF using the existing AEP control segment.

On 21 Jan 2017, PEO Space approved the Acquisition Strategy for the MCEU program. The MCEU acquisition strategy enables the GPS Enterprise to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter prior to GPS OCX delivery. MCEU will also support the scheduled operational testing of MGUE. MCEU will update the GPS control segment software, AEP, to allow for command and control, processing, and integrity monitoring of the M-Code signal. MCEU acquires this capability by using the existing GPS III prime contract vehicle to modify the operational AEP software.

The Air Force approved reinstatement of a previously deferred Key Support Area (KSA) on 10 Feb 2016. The MSTIC receivers currently under development will get a software upgrade to process M-Code data. This $7.96M project to procure the M-MSTIC receivers was funded through both O&amp;M and SPAF funds in FY 2016-FY 2018. Performance monitoring, integration, and test will be conducted by the MCEU program and sustained under the Global Positioning Operations Support and Sustainment Division contract with Lockheed Martin.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Superiority Intelligence program provides Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Electronic Support (ES) for key find, fix, track, target, engage and assess (F2T2EA) requirements supporting Space Superiority activities meeting Combatant Command (CCMD) needs. SSI funds developmental intelligence activities to support new space superiority capability acquisition and development. Funds associated developmental ISR Planning and direction, Collection, Processing and exploitation, Analysis and production, Dissemination and integration (PCPAD) capabilities providing Battlespace Awareness and Space Domain Awareness (SDA) in support of Space Superiority and Space Control. This includes funding for fixed and transportable intelligence collection, Processing/Exploitation and Dissemination (PED), analysis and production capabilities that are modular (plug-and-play), meet Risk Management Framework Accreditation requirements and can keep pace with technological advances and emerging threats. It provides intelligence support systems for SDA activities that provide the requisite current and predictive knowledge of space events and threat conditions and intelligence support to Space Security and Defense Programs (SSDP) by providing architectural survivability analysis of critical mission assets for mission assurance, as well as network analysis. It also supports specialized/tailored, phased threat system analysis and studies (A&amp;S), test support, lab equipment, and Material Acquisition and Exploitation (MAE) for system development, vulnerability, susceptibility assessments to support tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and future threat technology studies necessary for mission area success and achievement of space superiority, and to preserve the US space advantage across all domains. 

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2019, Projects 67A030 and 67A031, Joint Space Operations Mission System (JMS) Infrastructure and Mission Applications, were completed.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE1203614F, Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System, Project 67A035, Enterprise Space BMC2 efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, Budget Activity 08, PE 1208248SF, Space C2 from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force and a new Budget Activity for Software and Digital Technology Pilot Programs.

The Air Force is developing a Space Command and Control (Space C2) and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) capability for the Joint Force Space Component Commander (JFSCC). The enterprise-wide system will provide a common government infrastructure and standards for rapid prototyping of dynamic SSA and Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) applications to address the evolving and dynamic threat.  The system will provide a collaborative environment that will enhance and modernize SSA and BMC2 capabilities; create decision-relevant views of the space environment; rapidly detect, track and characterize objects of interest; identify / exploit traditional and non-traditional sources; perform space threat analysis; and enable efficient distribution of data across the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). Funding includes technical studies, development, experimentation, integration and related support costs.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This Program Element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Space C2 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in Program Elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort ends in FY 2019. 

Mission applications provides space services to enhance the accuracy, sustainability, and responsiveness of space surveillance capabilities by providing the knowledge environment necessary to enable the Joint Force Space Component Commander to make rapid, responsive decisions for the protection of space assets from proliferating threats (adversary as well as orbiting debris).  The system provides a high accuracy space catalog (knowledge of space objects), increased observation verification and capabilities, and improved event processing.  Research, development, and system design provides SSA space catalog applications, services, space surveillance observation processing, and sensor tasking.  Funding includes technical studies, development, and integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The architecture and infrastructure will modernize and deliver new capabilities in the National Space Defense Center, Combined Space Operations Center and other operations centers supporting SSA and BMC2. In addition to the OMS and UCI architectural efforts, SMC will continue developmental, system engineering and contracting efforts to integrate best in breed commercial, contractor and government applications for the OMS and UCI based ESBMC2 foundational architecture through the release of multiple incremental software capability drops throughout FY 2021.  Rapidly respond to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain.  Activities may include, but are not limited to program office support, studies, technical analysis, experimentation, prototyping, etc.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This $2.687M FY21 budget request for NSDC in Appropriation Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Air Force, PE 1203620F, should have been requested in PE 1203620SF, Appropriation Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force. Funds will be transferred to Space Force in the next year's budget request.

This program will develop, upgrade and field the National Space Defense Center's (NSDC) operational infrastructure integrating mission partner networks, data and other hardware and software solutions into NSDC's technical baseline.  Additionally, this program will provide for agile requirement development, and operational and developmental test activities supporting software Development in Operations (DevOps).  The NSDC allows the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events and will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community operations.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or re-purpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NSDC capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2021, PE 1203873F, Ballistic Missile Defense Radars efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203873SF Ballistic Missile Defense Radars from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force. 

COBRA DANE (CD) is a 40+ year old radar located on Eareckson AS, AK (Shemya Island, AK), executing two missions: Missile Defense (MD) and Space Domain Awareness(SDA). SDA mission supports New Foreign Launches (NFLs) and Space Catalog maintenance to include space debris tracking.  CD will acquire through design, development, Integration, and test a modern architecture to enhance mission capability providing Warfighter and Stakeholder customers direct operational benefit.  CD utilizes Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I), University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) and Assistance and Advisory Services (A&amp;AS) Contractors to support programmatic and technical activities.  Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Specifically,  the Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) Rehost program upgrades the CD system's radar back end mission data processing, radar management and control, and signal processing capabilities to a modern architecture that facilitates long term mission resiliency, cyber security, system viability, high operational availability, and rapid hardware and software development and deployment capability.  FY17 Above Threshold Reprograming (ATR) RDT&amp;E funds were provided to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to accelerate the joint Air Force and MDA modernization program of the CD radar which opens the door for a non-traditional acquisition approach using an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement through the OSD Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) Organization. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver COBRA DANE's weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F. In addition to funds being used to modernize this back end of the radar, these funds will also be used for out-year planning of front end component modernization including enhancement of communication elements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FY20 funds extend the prototype development toward integration, complete a System Integration Lab and transition to operationalize prototypes procured using non-traditional acquisition methods which will evolve the COBRA DANE radar back end mission data processing, radar management and control, and signal processing capabilities to a modern open architecture.  This architecture will facilitate long term mission resiliency, cyber security, system viability, high operational availability, and rapid hardware and software development and deployment capability. In addition to funds being used to modernize the back end of the radar, these funds may also be used for planning of front end component modernization including enhancement of communication elements.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 1203906F, project 67A051, ITW/AA C2 Integration of C2BMC Feeds, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element supports development activities for the NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Complex - Integrated Tactical Warning Attack Assessment (NCMC-ITW/AA) system that provides timely, unambiguous, and continuous warning and attack assessment of air, missile and space threats to North America, and geographical theaters.  This system integrates and correlates missile launch and air surveillance information from certified sources to assess the nature of an enemy launch/attack and issue warnings to the President of the United States, Canadian (national leadership), United States Secretary of Defense, National military Command center and war-fighting Combatant Commanders (C2).  NCMC-ITW/AA and Legacy Space C2 systems provide NORAD/NORTHCOM, USSTRATCOM and SPACECOM command structures with the information management, decision aids and connectivity required to monitor, assess, plan, and execute assigned strategic, space operations, and missile defense missions.  It provides Nuclear C2 and detonation detection. 

The Combatant Commanders Integrated Command and Control System (CCIC2S) is a unique, integrated C2 "system of systems”, providing data communication between external sensors and end users; mission processing for air and missile warning mission and system operations functions.  The system supports national strategic objectives with Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) and provides missile and air warning, cueing and engagement information to theater combatant commanders.   The system consists of terrestrial and space-based sensor outputs, C2 nodes, and communications and dissemination links, connecting the US and Canadian defense information networks.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2021, PE1203913F, NUDET Detection System (SPACE) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203913F, NUDET Detection System (SPACE) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space. USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM), and a classified mission.

The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF's USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and Systems Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&amp;T) activities on Space Vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below).

DoD funds their contribution to the USNDS program in Program Element (PE) 1203913F with Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF), and Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M).

USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified GEO host) and Space Test Platform (STP) 3. Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment, the RADEC Data Processor (RDP), and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), the five deployable mobile ground segment survivable Ground Nuclear Detonation Detection
 System Terminals (GNTs), and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded. The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for the Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental, evolutionary acquisition approach.

The upgrades to the GNTs are the survivable/endurable UGNT which are funded with RDT&amp;E in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable/endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The GNT supports ITW/AA and NFM missions. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System Survivable (SBIRS) / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM. The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the Mobile Ground System (MGS) mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT. The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced NUDET detection capabilities which meet survivable/ endurable attack assessment requirements directed by the President, Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM, delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.

This budget line includes systems engineering, research and development, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas. Sensor integration for GPS III and GPS IIIF are funded in their respective PEs.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NUDET Detection System (SPACE) weapon system capability. The use of such program funds is in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>USNDS System Engineering and Architecture Design</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The future USNDS build consists of an ICADS satellite ground data processing system and UGNT trailers that accommodate the new NDS payload on GPS IIIF family of vehicles and are an upgrade to the current USNDS 6 program. USNDS ICADS reports endoatmospheric, transition and near-space nuclear detonations as detected by the USNDS sensors aboard the GPS satellites, DSP satellites and SABRS equipped satellites. ICADS processes NDS, State-of-Health (SOH), and navigation data from GPS IIIF. USNDS UGNT provide NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable/endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/AEHF circuits. USNDS also consists of the Integrated Data Denial (IDD). IDD is a Communications Security (COMSEC) device associated with the USNDS. IDD provides decryption of satellite position data and NDS sensor data used to detect, locate, and report nuclear detonations in earth's atmosphere or near-space in near real time. This IDD effort contains cryptographic modifications mandated by National Security Agency (NSA). In addition, parts obsolescence requires the start of a new IDD design and manufacturing effort.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2021, PE 1203940F, Space Situation Awareness Operations efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203940SF Space Situation Awareness Operations from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of  all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; gathering intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. SSA also encompasses the integration, exploitation and delivery of data sources to facilitate the battle management and command and control of space forces.  This program element fields, upgrades, modifies, modernizes, operationalizes, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA Space Surveillance Network (SSN) while companion program element 1206425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in this program element (1203940F) focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering. 

Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) are efforts to upgrade, operationalize and extend the life of operational SSA sensors. These SLEPs extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. In addition, the SLEPs themselves may be designed to increase capabilities not currently realized. As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin SLEPs on additional efforts. These efforts may include prototyping and technology demonstrations.

Global Sensor Watch (GSW) Program provides an integrated SSA Tip &amp; Cue capability that implements a survivable architecture providing overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing event response, multiple level security processing of SSA data and automated cross-sensor tipping &amp; cueing worldwide. Other efforts to support Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) in space include developing &amp; deploying advanced software algorithms to identify, acquire, characterize, and maintain custody of both space objects of interest and new foreign launches; optimizing commercial, intelligence community (IC) &amp; Missile Defense Agency sensors to better support BMC2; developing &amp; executing Joint Functional Space Component Command (JFSCC) exercises such as Combined Space Operations Center and National Space Defense Center Experimentation, Test and Training Initiative to test &amp; optimize Space Control capabilities, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) development to increase probability of survival for blue assets, and refining requirements across the space enterprise; enhancing sensor performance to close the solar exclusion gap leveraging technologies such as optical daylight tracking and incorporating commercial &amp; IC sensors; and improving legacy paths to support bi-directional machine-to-machine sensor communications enabling a more complete BMC2 capability.

Ground Based Radar Upgrades improves the sensitivity, search capabilities and CONOPS of existing ground-based SSA sensors to better support custody and fire control timelines.

Programs and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats.  Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 12034940F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY 2021, PE 1206423F, Global Positioning System III - Operational Control Segment efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1206423SF Global Positioning System III - Operational Control Segment from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) distribution system which operates through all weather. GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

Program Element (PE) 1206423F funds Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) for the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX), the upgrade to OCX called OCX Block 3F to incorporate Regional Military Protection (RMP), command and control functionality for GPS III Follow-on (GPS IIIF) satellites, and the GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI). OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations, and 4) integrate Department of Defense (DoD) information assurance and cybersecurity controls and capabilities. OCX Block 3F will upgrade OCX with new capabilities to synchronize with GPS IIIF Space Segment capabilities. GPS EI is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.

OCX funds support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, resolving obsolescence issues, test and evaluation efforts, and mission operations. These activities support upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to enable efforts to protect United States (U.S.) Military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds ensure OCX efforts meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved required capabilities.

OCX Block 3F will upgrade OCX with new capabilities to synchronize with GPS IIIF Space Segment and Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Increment 2 capabilities. This includes advanced concept development such as systems analysis, modernized control segment development, modernization/deployment of 17 monitoring stations, mission planning development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, test resources, systems engineering required to meet the Government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification. OCX Block 3F will maintain backward compatibility and support the legacy constellation develop solutions necessary to command, control and monitor GPS IIIF, to include advance collection and integration of RMP high power regional M-code signals, rapid warfighter effects and support to GPS auxiliary payloads.

The GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments. The Government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, Allied and commercial GPS users.

The GPS EI project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish critical integration functions with the three GPS enterprise material segments along with the logistics, operational and transition communities. GPS EI maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise. Further, GPS EI provides modeling, simulation, and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification.

In addition, the GPS EI project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities. Examples for Generation II include electronic protection; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection and additional civil signals. To accomplish this, GPS EI delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments. In this capacity, GPS EI is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.

GPS EI's analyses guide Government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs. For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the GPS EI: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules; and conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS EI performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The Government owns the GPS Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the GPS EI team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances Government control, oversight and program accountability.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver OCX weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS is a space-based PNT distribution system which operates through all weather. This project funds the research and development for OCX. This includes, but is not limited to, advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, modernized control segment and mission planning development, modernization/ deployment of 17 monitoring stations, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and test resources.

OCX acquisition was established to: 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites; 2) incorporate situational awareness to support NAVWAR and signal monitoring; 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations; and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cybersecurity controls and capabilities. OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, technology development, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and Allied use of GPS. Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future JROC approved required capabilities.

OCX Block 0 (through Iteration 1.5) is the Launch and Control System (LCS) intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the on-orbit checkout of all GPS III satellites. OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.

OCX Block 1 (adds Iterations 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1 to Block 0) fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and civil signals (L1C/A), military signals (L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the modernized civil signal (L2C) and the aviation safety-of-flight signal (L5). In addition, Block 1 will field the basic operational capability to control the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M M-Code), and the globally compatible signal (L1C). It also fully meets information assurance/cyber defense requirements.

OCX Block 2 fields the advanced operational capability to control the advanced features of the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M M-Code). Blocks 1 &amp; 2 are being delivered concurrently as a result of the Oct 2016 Nunn-McCurdy review.

OCX Block 3F will modify OCX Blocks 1 and 2 to field new capabilities in support of the GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) production program and incorporate Regional Military Protection (RMP) to handle future threats. OCX Block 3F will upgrade OCX with new capabilities to synchronizes with GPS IIIF Space Segment and Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Increment 2 capabilities. OCX Block 3F will maintain backward compatibility with the existing capabilities to support the legacy GPS constellation and integrate into Block 1 and 2 and future efforts to support GPS IIIF. The OCX Block 3F effort will develop solutions necessary to command, control, and monitor GPS IIIF spacecraft and include advance collection and integration of RMP high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals, rapid warfighter effects, and support to GPS IIIF auxiliary payloads (including Search and Rescue (SAR), Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS)).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force is pursuing a "Block" approach for OCX in order to respond to warfighter capability requirements. The strategy calls for capability (e.g., better signal maintainability, Unified S-Band (USB), Search and Rescue (SAR) GPS, and near-real time Command and Control (C2)) on-ramps for the follow-on contract for GPS III Space Vehicles (SVs) (starting no earlier than SV11) which will require updates to the OCX ground segment. Enterprise studies will ensure GPS Enterprise synchronization across space and ground segments.  Acquisition strategy for OCX Block 3F is currently in work.  However, the program office is targeting a tailored ACAT II program with a targeted award in FY 2021.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The GPS Joint Program Office established and maintains the technical baseline and is responsible for the successful fielding of all the GPS Segments (space, control, and user). In order to successfully execute these responsibilities, GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI) creates an enterprise architecture, integrates segment products, verifies the enterprise requirements are adequately met, develops and implements various Systems Engineering documents, defines methods of verification, conducts integrated system test and test analysis, develops and manages the Enterprise technical baseline which reflect multiple stakeholder requirements; Stakeholders include the Department of Defense (DoD), foreign governments, industry, and the general public (through four public interface specifications). Furthermore, GPS EI ensures GPS capabilities meet the warfighter's, civil agencies', commercial entities', international treaties', and over four billion global GPS users' needs. Moreover, GPS EI is responsible for delivering a reliable PNT signal capability to military operators, the civil user community, and international partners. In addition, GPS EI validates the system performance in various mission threat scenarios during its development as well as provides in-depth technical expertise to enhance government control, oversight and program accountability. GPS EI is also responsible for all aspects of schedule and technical alignment across the GPS segments (space, control, and user). 

More specifically, GPS EI is responsible for technical baseline management, integration, synchronizing, testing, and verifying GPS III, OCX, Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE), M-Code Early Use (MCEU) and Contingency Operations (COps). Additionally, GPS EI is responsible for creating and managing plans that provide early exercise of the products under development, compatibility analysis, and inter-segment testing. The inter-segment tests are required to prove OCX interoperability with GPS III satellites and modernized user equipment. More importantly, it ensures backwards compatibility with GPS Block II satellites and legacy user equipment. The GPS EI also manages the process through which the JROC validated requirements are matured and flowed down to the system segments, while remaining consistent with various interfaces. This enables the GPS system to meet Title 10 of the USC, Sec 2281, mandated GPS capabilities, and various other obligations to the international community that provide inter-operable PNT signals. 

GPS EI also supports the Government Joint Program Office's GPS spectrum protection at international forums such as the International Telecommunications Union. Such support consists of advocating on behalf of the United States (U.S.) Government when negotiating with foreign partners. In addition, GPS EI provides technical expertise to maintain relationships with other U.S. government agencies that include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and  Departments of State (DOS), Transportation (DoT), Homeland Security (DHS), and Commerce (DOC). GPS EI Spectrum also ensures GPS priority for eight essential spectrum signals, including those required for civil air navigation and safety of life. Spectrum Protection prevents encroachment from commercial or foreign entities, which results in the preservation of warfighter's reliable signal. As a result, military operations and the integrity of the global economic infrastructure are protected.
 
GPS EI also provides the GPS enterprise expertise in System Safety, Enterprise level System Security Engineering covering Acquisition Systems Program Security (i.e., personnel, industrial, operations, information, sensitive compartmented information, communication, and physical), Program Protection, Foreign Disclosure, Public Release reviews, Mission System Certification and Accreditation, and Enterprise Cybersecurity. GPS EI is accountable for the development, execution, and analysis of OCX, cybersecurity, and associated test cases necessary to deliver a secure operational system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with a "back to basics" acquisition approach and the exercise of strong oversight of development contractors, the Air Force is required to exercise complete ownership of the architecture, system definition, technical baseline, and integration of the GPS space, ground, and user segments. While this complex inter- segment integration is traditionally performed by a prime contractor under a systems development contract, for GPS, this approach requires the government to be the integrator. To execute this responsibility, the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) contractor. The GPS EI function of the SE&amp;I contractor is currently funded within this PE. The SE&amp;I effort was originally procured in 2007 through a full and open competition, as was the new follow-on SE&amp;I contract awarded in 2015. The SE&amp;I follow-on strategy builds in year over year cost reductions as requirements stabilize.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2021, PE 1206770F, Enterprise Ground Services efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1206770SF Enterprise Ground Services from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.

The Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) program will provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems. The EGS capability will become the primary ground command and control (C2) suite of services for the Air Force Space Enterprise to meet evolving current and future space domain demands.  EGS is based on Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) C2 capabilities developed under the Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program.  

The EGS C2 program will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and resiliency in space program ground systems. EGS will focus efforts on the rapid development and deployment of tactical C2 services, developing and integrating on-premises and cloud infrastructure and laboratories at multiple sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cyber security development and implementation. Programs and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats. Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.

Over the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) EGS will be developing and deploying C2 services and software applications that support transitioning legacy and new missions such as Missile Warning, Missile Defense, MILSATCOM, Space Situational Awarness and various classified and experimental satellites and missions to the EGS open architecture.  The modifications to core software applications provided by EGS are being made in an Agile DevSecOps environment, which has been fundamentally designed into EGS since its inception. 

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

The program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EGS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The EGS acquisition strategy focuses on rapidly delivering C2 prototypes and operational capabilities to warfighters, while leveraging industry best practices for agile development and continuous integration /delivery (CI/CD). One of the key tenets of the EGS acquisition strategy is to maintain government ownership of the technical baseline. As a result, EGS uses a combination of existing and new contracts, and agreements with industry and academia to procure prototypes, platform as a service (PaaS) capabilities, system engineering services, and pre-operations support for mission users. Leverage the two SBIR Phase 3 contracts that were awarded in late FY 2019 to scale EGS capabilities and enable more rapid and development and deployment of tactical C2 services to operational users.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Program element (PE) 0603778A MLRS Product Improvement Program supports development and testing of the Army's rocket launcher fleet, including the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher. MLRS and HIMARS launchers support the Army's number one priority modernization effort, Long Range Precision Fires.  Updated launchers are required to fire current and future munitions such as the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS).  Funding from both Projects 093 and DX8 contributes to common efforts between both launcher platforms such as Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) integration and rocket launcher software development effort by Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation and Missile Center (CCDC AvMC). The goal is to develop common solutions applicable to both MLRS and HIMARS launchers. 

Project 093 M270A1 MLRS launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets/missiles from the current MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM) to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System-Unitary (GMLRS-U), GMLRS-Alternative Warhead, the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and future MFOM to include the ER GMLRS, and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM).  Funds software development, training updates, Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) technology implementation, integration of satellite communications, and nonrecurring engineering for the MLRS launcher. Funds development related to maintaining capability associated with the current and evolving threat. Funding in FY 2023-2025 also funds non-recurring engineering for system hardware and software modernization to the MLRS chassis, Launcher Loader Module, and Fire Control System.  Funding from both Projects 093 and DX8 contributes to common efforts between both launcher platforms such as APNT integration and rocket launcher software development effort by CCDC AvMC. The goal is to develop common solutions applicable to both MLRS and HIMARS launchers. 

Justification:
Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Base funding in the amount of $5.036 million for Project 093 continues tactical launcher software development, qualification, and materiel release to support the Fire Control System (FCS) electronic obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a MLRS launcher.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher.  The FY 2021 funds also allow additional integration of Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) capabilities, and integration of satellite communications, allowing the MLRS to continue to effectively operate in near peer and peer threat environments. 

Project DX8 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the current and emerging MLRS MFOM, to include the GMLRS-U, GMLRS-Alternative Warhead, the ATACMS and future MFOM to include the ER GMLRS, and the PrSM.  Funds software development, training updates, APNT technology implementation, integration of satellite communications, and nonrecurring engineering for the HIMARS launcher. Funds development related to maintaining capability associated with the current and evolving threat.  Funding from both Projects 093 and DX8 contributes to common efforts between both launcher platforms such as APN integration and rocket launcher software development effort by CCDC AvMC. The goal is to develop common solutions applicable to both MLRS and HIMARS launchers. 

FY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $5.121 million for Project DX8 supports tactical launcher software development and qualification to support the Fire Control System (FCS) electronic obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a HIMARS launcher. The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher. This effort funds research integration of Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) capabilities, and integration of satellite communications, allowing the HIMARS to continue to effectively operate in near peer threat environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project DX8 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the current and emerging MLRS MFOM, to include the GMLRS-U, GMLRS-Alternative Warhead, the ATACMS and future MFOM to include the ER GMLRS, and the PrSM.  Funds software development, training updates, APNT technology implementation, integration of satellite communications, and nonrecurring engineering for the HIMARS launcher. Funds development related to maintaining capability associated with the current and evolving threat.  Funding from both Projects 093 and DX8 contributes to common efforts between both launcher platforms such as Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) integration and rocket launcher software development effort by CCDC AvMC. The goal is to develop common solutions applicable to both MLRS and HIMARS launchers. 

Justification:
FY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $5.121 million for Project DX8 supports tactical launcher software development and qualification to support the Fire Control System (FCS) electronic obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a HIMARS launcher. The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher. This effort funds research integration of Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) capabilities, and integration of satellite communications, allowing the HIMARS to continue to effectively operate in near peer threat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project ER2 Close Combat Technology project includes development efforts to upgrade Close Combat technologies, energetics, and munitions, such as counter explosives, grenades, demolitions, shoulder launched munitions, pyrotechnic simulators, countermeasure flares, non-lethal ammunition/systems, networked munitions and mines, that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.  This program will identify, characterize, study, analyze, test and develop technologies to resolve close combat munition reliability, safety, environmental, storage, standardization, obsolescence and manufacturing/producibility issues. Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funds will resource improvements to the following grenade efforts:  MK3A2 Replacement - XM111 Offensive Hand Grenade, M82 Simulant Smoke Practice Grenade, M67 (G881) Insensitive Munition (IM) Replacement, and M98/M99 Non-Lethal 66mm Grenades. 

Project ER5 Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology Project includes product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production.  Efforts include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk by introducing new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.  FY 2021 funding will support the transition and incorporation of the newly translated transceiver prototypes into indirect production fuzes with the generation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to the Technical Data Packages (TDPs), conduct analysis of the improved prototyping techniques of the Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) impact switches for use in mortar and medium caliber fuzes, support the evaluations on hand grenade fuzes to reduce the number of critical defects, which will increase producibility and safety, conduct tests to prove out performance on the next generation microcontroller for mortar proximity fuzes, conduct analysis on mortar training fuzes for performance improvements during early ballistic flight, and conduct testing of enhanced delay mode design on the M739A1 artillery fuze for increased safety and performance.  FY 2021 funding will also support qualification of Hexachloroethane Zinc Oxide (HC) smoke fill formulation into the 60mm and 81mm smoke families of ammunition.  Engineering efforts will identify the formulation percentage of constituents and identify the production processes required to promote effective smoke production that is less toxic and ultimately provides effective smoke screening and burn time performance.

Project ER6 Direct Fire Technology funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. FY 2021 funds support making lethality and safety improvements to 40mm grenades, performing improvements to 30mm ammunition, making a number of improvements to training ammunition, performing improvements to small caliber primers to make the primers more environmentally friendly, and continuing the effort to reduce Soldier load by developing lightweight small caliber ammunition. FY 2021 also includes potential examination and implementation of improvements to 105mm and 120mm tank ammunition.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The use of HC has been restricted inside and outside the CONUS/OCONUS due to its toxic effects.  The legacy AN-M8 grenade is limited to use in contingency operations only.  The M83 training smoke grenade is currently used in lieu of the AN-M8 in both training and tactical operations, but does not give screening performance comparable to the legacy AN-M8.  Soldiers must use two or three M8 grenades to produce obscuration effects comparable to a single AN-M8 grenade.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The strategy for the MK3A2 Offensive Hand Grenade is to develop, test and qualify a new design, XM111, that eliminates the toxic hazards and provides the required performance for the user in FY 2019.  Follow-on procurement efforts will be competitive pending market research.  

The strategy for the AN-M8A1 is to qualify an alternative fill due to obsolescence and manufacturability driven changes required to provide smoke for use by Soldiers to meet existing validated requirements.  Once the smoke fill is qualified, the plan is to investigate the cost and impact to upgrade the Pine Bluff Arsenal grenade loading facilities.

The M82 program is updating the design of specific parts to make it more producible and will be proving out the design for use in future production efforts.

The M98/M99 Non-Lethal 66mm Grenades program is updating the design of the propulsion base to make it more producible and will be proving out the design for use in future production efforts at Pine Bluff Arsenal.

The strategy for the legacy M67 Fragmentation Hand Grenade is to build up to 3 different prototype designs, conduct a shoot-off to down-select to the best design, and then qualify the new design that mitigates the insensitive munition hazards associated with the explosive fill and the fuze technology.  Follow-on procurement efforts will be competitive pending market research.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology Project includes product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production. Efforts include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk by introducing new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.

This Project supports the identification, study, analysis, and integration of fuzing technologies and safe arm devices in production and in the field.  The Project implements new technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  The Project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades.  Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce costs as a result of competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available.  It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects.  Block upgrades will identify and support studies on improvements to fuzes, increase commonality of fuze components and requirements.  Upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuze design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will support the transition and incorporation of the newly translated transceiver prototypes into indirect production fuzes with the generation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to the Technical Data Packages (TDPs), conduct analysis of the improved prototyping techniques of the Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) impact switches for use in mortar and medium caliber fuzes, support the evaluations on hand grenade fuzes to reduce the number of critical defects, which will increase producibility and safety, conduct tests to prove out performance on the next generation microcontroller for mortar proximity fuzes, conduct analysis on mortar training fuzes for performance improvements during early ballistic flight, and conduct testing of enhanced delay mode design on the M739A1 artillery fuze for increased safety and performance.

This Project also supports the incorporation of the new Hexachloroethane Zinc Oxide (HC) smoke fill formulation while utilizing the existing illumination shell body configuration to support mortar smoke training for US Army Europe (USAREUR).  The HC smoke fill formulation is less toxic and less incendiary than the current Mortar Red Phosphorus (RP) or White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke rounds and will reduce risk of unintended collateral damage or environmentally hazardous waste.  USAREUR has yearly requirements for procurement of smoke mortar cartridges across all calibers to be used for training, but is prohibited from training with the current WP or RP smoke munitions in Europe due to environmental restrictions.  FY 2021 funding will support qualification of HC smoke fill formulation into the 60mm and 81mm smoke families of ammunition.  Engineering efforts will identify the formulation percentage of constituents and identify the production processes required to promote effective smoke production that is less toxic and ultimately provides effective smoke screening and burn time performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Fuze Technology Integration (FTI) will improve current production munitions by exploiting existing fuzing technologies and inserting them into current fielded and/or production fuzes, providing safer, more producible, and more lethal fuzing solutions.  FTI develops second source suppliers and resolves component obsolescence issues to mitigate risk and prevent production interruptions in order to continue to provide safer, more reliable munitions for the Warfighter with significant risk reduction to production fuzes also benefiting the U.S. Taxpayer.  The effort is a continuation of studies, analysis, evaluations, and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field.  This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude component obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  FTI utilizes both the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to produce prototypes of the fuze technologies and devices, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contracts to implement proven efforts into production fuzes.

The Hexachloroethane Zinc Oxide (HC) smoke mortar cartridge project will use existing production process and technologies at Government Owned Government Operated (GOGO) facilities that currently produce 60mm/81mm/120mm smoke and illumination munitions.  Crane Army Ammunition Activity (CAAA) Pyro will be responsible for mixing and pressing HC smoke compositions for all testing and development, and CAAA fabrication shop will produce smoke canisters.  Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA) will conduct body load and Load Assemble and Pack (LAP) of all cartridge test samples for qualification and validation testing. All other components will use standard parts currently in inventory or can be purchased through existing component contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), formerly known as Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), is the Army's next generation surface-to-surface missile that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. PrSM requirements include: max range of greater than 400 kilometers (km), specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds two missiles, survivability in a threat environment, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A2 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). PrSM will meet cluster and insensitive munition requirements and is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Future Spirals will include the ability to attack moving maritime and ground targets, provide increased lethality and extended range. The mission of the PrSM System is to attack/ neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. PrSM will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly/ staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. PrSM will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. Milestone A was approved on 31 March 2017 and the program is currently in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 base dollars in the amount of $122.733 million supports the transition of PrSM from TMRR to Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD). The program successfully completed a flight demonstration in 1st Quarter (1Q) FY 2020 and awarded a follow-on TMRR agreement to a single contractor. TMRR efforts to include: finalize tactical design, complete sub-assembly and missile qualification testing, finalize missile interface, and continue software integration with existing launcher platforms before flight testing four (4) PrSM Engineering Development Test (EDT) missiles. Additionally, the program will establish pilot line manufacturing processes and validate capabilities to support PrSM production.  Demonstration of capabilities through a rigorous test program ensures the Army makes an informed production decision for building missiles beginning in FY 2022. After completion of Milestone B, the Government will award a single EMD phase contract for final Government safety and qualification testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), formerly known as Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), is the Army's next generation surface-to-surface missile that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. PrSM requirements include: max range of greater than 400 kilometers (km), specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds two missiles, survivability in a threat environment, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A2 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). PrSM will meet cluster and insensitive munition requirements and is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Future Spirals will include the ability to attack moving maritime and ground targets, provide increased lethality and extended range. The mission of the PrSM System is to attack/ neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. PrSM will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly/ staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. PrSM will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. Milestone A was approved on 31 March 2017 and the program is currently in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 base dollars in the amount of $122.733 million supports the transition of PrSM from TMRR to Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD). The program successfully completed a flight demonstration in 1st Quarter (1Q) FY 2020 and awarded a follow-on TMRR agreement to a single contractor. TMRR efforts to include: finalize tactical design, complete sub-assembly and missile qualification testing, finalize missile interface, and continue software integration with existing launcher platforms before flight testing four (4) PrSM Engineering Development Test (EDT) missiles. Additionally, the program will establish pilot line manufacturing processes and validate capabilities to support PrSM production.  Demonstration of capabilities through a rigorous test program ensures the Army makes an informed production decision for building missiles beginning in FY 2022. After completion of Milestone B, the Government will award a single EMD phase contract for final Government safety and qualification testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The PrSM Acquisition Strategy supports development of the Army's next generation surface to surface missile that replaces and improves upon ATACMS capabilities with major improvements in range, effectiveness, lethality, and rate of fire, while meeting insensitive and cluster munition policy requirements. PrSM provides an open system architecture that facilitates future growth. PrSM provides responsive engagement of high value point and area targets by Army and Joint Force Commanders under all weather conditions, at operational ranges defended by enemy air-defense systems. An AoA supporting the MS A decision was completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with an OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015. In 4Q FY 2016, the Army awarded 9 month risk reduction, trade study and initial design development agreements to two contractors. The effort resulted in development of initial baseline designs presented during final technical reviews that resulted in a seamless transition into the TMRR phase. Subsequent to MS A approval on 31 March 2017, the Army awarded TMRR agreements to two contractors. TMRR is ongoing and includes risk reduction activities and further maturation of contractor design concepts. Both contractors participated in a PDR in 1Q FY 2019 to inform design.

In FY 2018, the Army directed acceleration of PrSM capability in response to immediate near-peer threats and the requirement to engage targets with a precision guided missile out to 499km. As a result, the program was restructured to conduct the following key activities previously not planned for in TMRR: finalize tactical designs, build additional missiles for system level EDT flight tests, begin subsystem qualification, and establish a production capability. This approach allows the Army to reduce program risk prior to EMD award, and accelerate an early capability. 

The EMD phase will include assembly of PQT flight test articles in parallel with completion of ground and system qualification, tactical software integration on the HIMARS and M270A2 launch platforms and production planning efforts. Also during this time the program will refine critical missile survivability assessments to ensure the selected EMD design will successfully meet the Army's PrSM kinetic, electro-magnetic spectrum, cyber, environmental, nuclear requirements. The culmination of these efforts will inform a Government CDR planned for 1Q FY 2022 and support of fielding an early capability via Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) in FY23.  After the program meets the UMR requirements the remaining EMD phase activities will complete product development, system level qualification, production readiness assessment, and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).

Beginning in FY 2021 and thru the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), the Army has programmed Missile Procurement Army (MIPA) funding on line item number 8540C29600. These funds will support initial UMR fielding to close the capability gap between the current capability and near-peer missile capabilities before the program transitions to Full Rate Production (FRP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The funding associated with the Apache Product Improvement Program funding line, previously known as Apache Block III, funded the non-recurring engineering
(NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began
in Oct 2011). The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build. This project addresses reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft. Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)
Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability,
Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM)
integration. Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications. The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and
meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The funding associated with the Apache Product Improvement Program funding line, previously known as Apache Block III, funded the non-recurring engineering
(NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began
in Oct 2011). The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build. This project 
addresses reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft. Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)
Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability,
Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM)
integration. Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications. The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and
meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>UH-60V:
The H-60L Digital Blackhawk, now designated as UH-60V, is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging. Continuing funding will provide hardware and software development, training material development, as well as developmental and operational testing.

MEDEVAC:
Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding will also support non-recurring engineering to integrate and qualify MEDEVAC Mission Equipment Package (MEP) into the UH-60V Black Hawk helicopter.  This MEDEVAC MEP integration effort is independent of the UH-60V Program of Record and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB).  The Surgeon General (TSG) has a requirement for a MEDEVAC capability provided by Black Hawk helicopters that were not initially produced for MEDEVAC, but are designated to support the MEDEVAC mission. In accordance with AR 40-60 Medical Materiel Acquisition Policy, the Program Executive Office for Aviation (PEOAVN) is responsible for the costs associated with medical MEP integration on Black Hawk helicopters that were not initially produced for MEDEVAC, but require medical MEP modifications/upgrades to support the MEDEVAC mission.  MEDEVAC MEP integration on the UH-60V will address obsolescence and reduce the logistics footprint by increasing equipment commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet and will reduce the number of Black Hawk MEDEVAC configurations.  Additionally, UH-60V MEDEVAC capabilities will increase when comparing MEDEVAC MEP integration on legacy Black Hawk helicopters.  Capability improvements will include simultaneous Rescue Hoist and extended range capability, enabled MEDEVAC Mission Sensor (MMS) use in Arctic conditions, UH-60V Multi-Function Display (MFD) integrated MMS video, and Multi-Function Controller Unit (MFCU) integration of MMS functions.

Independent of the UH-60V Program of Record and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), incremental RDT&amp;E funding to support integration of a MEDEVAC capability on UH-60V is planned for FY 2019-2022.  In accordance with AR 40-60, Medical Materiel Acquisition Policy, the Army's Aeromedical Evacuation capability is funded by two portfolio managers, PEOAVN and the Medical Research Development Command, MRDC.  PEOAVN is responsible for the integration of MEDEVAC MEP on the UH-60V.  MRDC is responsible for recurring costs to procure kits and resource the installation of MEP kits on UH-60V MEDEVAC helicopters.

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>MN1000, MEDEVAC MEP provides procurement funding for MEDEVAC MEP capability on UH-60 helicopters. Per requirements, starting in FY 2022, MN1000 will resource procurement of MEDEVAC MEP kits and installations at a rate of 15 aircraft per year through FY 2034, which is the estimated year the AAO of 200 UH-60V MEDEVAC is reached.  Figures shown above reflect the full MN1000 - OPA3/MN1000/Combat Support Medical funding line, which includes the production kits and MEP installation costs at CCAD.    UH-60V MEDEVAC MEP MN1000 OPA requirements are $5.7 million in FY 2022, $6.1 million in FY 2023, and $6.1 million in FY 2024.  Total MEDEVAC MEP requirement in MN1000 through FY 2034 is $88.1M.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The UH-60V program plans to leverage the Prototype Integration Facility (PIF), a Government Owned Government Operated (GOGO) facility, to design, integrate and build three production representative aircraft. The GOGO facility uses a cost plus contract vehicle and conducted full and open competition for the selection of the avionics solution provider.

Independent of the UH-60V Program of Record and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), the MEDEVAC MEP program plans to utilize the U. S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Aviation and Missile Center (AvMC) and PIF to design and integrate MEDEVAC capability into the UH-60V.  By leveraging the same GOGO facility utilized by the UH-60V program, efficient design, software development, integration, and testing will occur by eliminating redundant tasks and employing experienced government resources already in possession of pertinent UH-60V technical data required to support the MEDEVAC MEP non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort.  Prototype, validation, and verification of technical publications, as well as airworthiness testing will be accomplished following completion of the UH-60V IOT&amp;E, at which time up to two UH-60V EDM aircraft will be allocated to the MEDEVAC MEP program.  Following completion of MEDEVAC MEP NRE, technical products will feed production and fielding contracts, which will be resourced by the U.S. Army Medical Department, AMEDD.  Procurement funding is programmed on MN1000 Combat Support Medical, G13010 MEDEVAC MEP.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Program Element (PE) 0607137A Chinook Product Improvement Program is critical to achieving the Army's heavy lift Multi-Domain Operational capability.  With an increased payload and operational reach, the CH-47F Block II is the only platform that can lift the JLTV, M777 and medium girder bridge to enable Multi-Domain Forces to Compete, Penetrate, Disintegrate, and Exploit at operationally relevant distances.  

The CH-47F Block II acquisition program upgrades existing CH-47F aircraft and procures common hardware that exists between the CH-47F and MH-47G aircraft for Special Operations Forces.  The CH-47F Block II program provides additional capability to the field with greater reach, increased payload capability and an increase in maximum gross weight to 54,000 pounds.  These improvements are based on airframe and subcomponent changes.  Specifically, the Advanced Chinook Rotor Blades will increase lift in high-hot conditions while improved flight control and drive train components will both increase aircraft performance and reduce O&amp;S costs.  The program updates the Common Avionics Architecture System and Digital Advanced Flight Control System systems of the aircraft and incorporates other avionics changes introduced into the final CH-47F production lots.  CH-47F Block II will also include a strengthened airframe which introduces commonality with the MH-47G and improvements to rotor, fuel, and electrical systems which will improve safety and reliability for the aircraft.  Along with providing a significantly increased capability to the field, the program includes provisions for anticipated future upgrades as well as weight and cost savings initiatives to ensure the Army has a platform with the flexibility and performance needed to meet the needs of Multi-Domain Operations until a Heavy Future Vertical Lift variant is fielded.

The Cargo Project Management Office awarded the CH-47F Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in July 2017.  The EMD phase will produce three production representative test articles to support a Milestone C decision in the 4th quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.  This phase will include contractor and government led system level qualification testing.  The contractor led system level qualification testing includes both ground and flight test.  The government led system level qualification testing includes Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3), Limited User Test (LUT) and aircraft subsystem Live-Fire Test and Evaluation (LFTE).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It is capable of training mission tasks and emergency procedures and provides a cost savings when compared to using aircraft for these purposes.  The TFPS will increase safety and mitigate risk to Block II Limited User Test (LUT) aircrews by allowing pilots to train aircraft differences in modifications, handling qualities, performance and human factors considerations before actual flight is performed.  Training in the TFPS reduces LUT timelines and improves aircrew proficiency as confirmed in the CH-47F (Block I) Phase 2 User Test Report.  The initial Block II TFPS will also serve as building block for upgrading the fielded TFPSs to the Block II configuration.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Cargo Program Management Office (PMO) is executing a block strategy to facilitate incremental upgrades to ensure performance necessary to meet the needs of the Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) until a Heavy Future Vertical Lift (FVL) variant is fielded.  The Block II program will restore performance lost due to the added weight of safety and survivability equipment incorporated since initial fielding in 2007.  Additional objectives of the Block II program include: efficiently incorporating multiple engineering changes, accomplishing required mid-life airframe recapitalization, converging the special operations and conventional Army designs, establishing a foundation for future block upgrades, and maintaining the industrial base until a Heavy FVL is realized.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) develops, tests, qualifies, and integrates the next generation turboshaft engine on Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), Black Hawk and Apache aircraft.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6,000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 class shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth without an increase to the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, and platform integration and qualification.  ITEP is postured to accelerate based on General Electric contract incentives and integration.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract that was awarded to General Electric in February 2019, platform/engine integration design engineering, and ballistic assessments ending in FY 2020. FY 2020 funding continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration A-kit development, engine Critical Design Review (CDR), engine component testing will begin, engine fit check will be performed for Apache and Black Hawk platforms, and the CDR for Apache. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, continues engine component testing, leading to First Engine To Test (FETT), begins Preliminary Flight Rating (PFR) testing, completes the Black Hawk A-Kit CDR, and begins physical airframe integration. FY 2022 funding will continue PFR testing, leading to a Preliminary Flight Rated engine in FY 2023, and continues physical airframe integration. FY 2023 funding provides for aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk and the initiation of engine full qualification testing. FY 2024 funding provides for completion of engine qualification, continuation of aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk, and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  FY 2025 funding provides for engine integration and A-kit development for the H-60V platform, Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE) for Black Hawk and Apache, continuation of LRIP, and continuation of flight/qualification for both Black Hawk and Apache.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) develops, tests, qualifies, and integrates the next generation turboshaft engine on Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), Black Hawk and Apache aircraft.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6,000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 class shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth without an increase to the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, and platform integration and qualification.  ITEP is postured to accelerate based on General Electric contract incentives and integration.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract that was awarded to General Electric in February 2019, platform/engine integration design engineering, and ballistic assessments ending in FY 2020. FY 2020 funding continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration A-kit development, engine Critical Design Review (CDR), engine component testing will begin, engine fit check will be performed for Apache and Black Hawk platforms, and the CDR for Apache. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, continues engine component testing, leading to First Engine To Test (FETT), begins Preliminary Flight Rating (PFR) testing, completes the Black Hawk A-Kit CDR, and begins physical airframe integration. FY 2022 funding will continue PFR testing, leading to a Preliminary Flight Rated engine in FY 2023, and continues physical airframe integration. FY 2023 funding provides for aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk and the initiation of engine full qualification testing. FY 2024 funding provides for completion of engine qualification, continuation of aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk, and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  FY 2025 funding provides for engine integration and A-kit development for the H-60V platform, Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE) for Black Hawk and Apache, continuation of LRIP, and continuation of flight/qualification for both Black Hawk and Apache.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Scalable Control Interface (SCI) will be the primary means of Command and Control (C2) for Program of Record Army Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). SCI software will be hosted on Mission Command devices in both ground and airborne platforms serving as nodes on the Integrated Tactical Network to retrieve and provide data.  SCI distributes UAS capabilities by greatly increasing the number of UAS control devices available to Soldiers and Commanders through the depth of the battlefield. SCI provides simultaneous control of multiple aircraft from a single node. SCI leverages a Modular Operating System Approach (MOSA) to software in order to reduce time and cost to integrate new hardware and software in response to the dynamic future operating environment.  

Deployment of SCI will include, but is not limited to, devices in the Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment (such as Nett Warrior), Mounted Computing Environment (such as MFoCS), and Command Post Computing Environment (such as TSI).  SCI will integrate decision-aiding, autonomy, and artificial intelligence as they mature technically, in order to support MDO tenets and enable Many-to-Many (vice 1 controller: 1 UAS) Control/use of UAS assets and reduce cognitive workload.

Justification: FY2021 SCI (Formerly Universal Product) Base funding of $7.743M will be used to continue the development of software applications needed to address the SCI MOSA/Future Airborne Capabilities Environment (FACE) Compliant Software requirement that support NETT Warrior, Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS), and Mission Command Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI). Pertinent activities include Systems Engineering, Software Integration, Logistics Planning, Test, and Program Management.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The common processor trade study supported Apache's approach for addressing the increasing demand for processing power while reducing logistical impact from both a maintenance and supply perspective. The sensor processing and fusion at a platform level processor or other upstream dedicated processor trade study looked at identifying upstream processing options for providing an optimized situational awareness picture of the operational environment and supporting enhanced target/threat identification utilizing multiple sensor inputs.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Apache Program management Office (PMO) needs to develop a phased approach to incorporate an Improved Tail Rotor Drive System (ITRDS) for the AH-64 platform. Several improvements to the existing drivetrain are necessary to increase safety margins on the tail rotor anti-torque capability. The platform overtime will continue to increase in gross weight through system upgrades and larger payloads being authorized. Missions being conducted at higher density altitudes and an increased gross weight will put the warfighters at risk of being in a loss of tail rotor authority scenario which can lead to a catastrophic situation. These product improvements would increase performance from the legacy design, decrease the maintenance burden on the warfighter, and reduce overall O&amp;S costs. These improvements would also build the infrastructure for an improved Drive system that will be able to handle increased performance upgrades, provide a positive impact to future sustainment, support Multi-Domain Operations, and ensuring the warfighter is not placed in a catastrophic situation when it is preventable. The funding would be utilized to conduct analysis, determine feasibility of life limits, and initiate redesign plans on new components of the drive system to include hanger bearings, elastomeric mounts, Intermediate Gearbox (IGB), Tail Rotor Gearbox (TRGB), drive shafts, and other components impacted on the Tail Rotor Drive System found during testing.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DT2 / Non-MIP Biometrics - Biometrics Enabling Capability 0 (BEC 0), aka DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS), is an Army information technology system supporting identity superiority by providing the critical core capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected threat actors in Multi Domain Operations (MDO) to include peer adversaries, terrorists and third country nationals.  BEC 0 is an Army Program of Record and DoD's only authoritative biometric repository, providing 24/7 operational support for the Warfighter and interagency partners to decide and act in near-real time with timely identification and identity verification of known or suspected threat actors across the full range of military operations.  DoD ABIS enables actionable intelligence supporting offensive operations and preventing espionage, sabotage, terrorist operations and other coercive actions against US forces and partner nations.  DoD ABIS enables the Army, all other DOD components, Interagency and International Partners to effectively impede adversary's ability to conceal their identity and intentions.  DoD ABIS supports all three objectives of the National Defense Strategy to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation, and improve business practices.

The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA), under the Provost Marshal General, fulfills the Secretary of the Army's Executive Agent (EA) responsibilities for
all DoD forensics and biometrics activities.  In addition, DFBA is the proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and
information management support throughout the Armed Services and DoD.  DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvement and implementation of
efficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities
that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational
effectiveness on the battlefield.  The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific
requirements identified by combat developers.

Justification:

FY 2021 RDT&amp;E funding in DT2 is $0. BEC 0 is in sustainment.  
 
FY 2021 funding in the amount of $1.325 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility,
and that DFBA objectives and requirements are met.  DFBA supports the conduct of biometrics and forensics activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability
assessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA), under the Provost Marshal General, fulfills the Secretary of the Army's Executive Agent (EA) responsibilities for all DoD forensics and biometrics activities. As the proponent, DFBA supports and provides oversight for Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) activities and information management throughout the Armed Services and DoD. DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvement and implementation of efficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers.

Justification:
FY 2021 funding in the amount of $1.325 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA supports the conduct of biometric and forensics activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability assessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program (PIP) provides for the upgrade of the PATRIOT System through individual materiel changes and upgrades to the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability with the emerging threat. As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulation, integration and testing. Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints. Flight testing is periodically required for validation of the modeling and simulation as well as satisfying Army Test and Evaluation Command/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (ATEC/DOTE) requirements of segment improvements.

This effort supports work with national agencies to evaluate, assess, and develop means to mitigate threat trends and specific threat developments potentially impacting system performance. Specific improvements may be developed and fielded under this task if warranted. The effort maintains the Mission Tailoring Database, responding to immediate tactical concerns. Database updates are fielded between major software upgrades as necessary.

The PIP line also supports identification, analysis, design, and test materiel solutions to counter cyber security and electronic warfare shortcomings to all elements of the Lower Tier Battle Space.

PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.

FY 2021 base dollars in the amount of $187,840 million support the continuance of Software Improvement for Threat Evolution, PAC-3 Seeker Software Improvement, Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM), Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Combat ID enhancements, Tasks 2, 6, and 7 activities, program integration, modeling and simulation, acquisition of test assets and targets, Mobile Flight Mission Simulator (MFMS), PDB-8, ARM Asset Defense, government and contractor support.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware, software, interceptors (PAC-2, Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PAC-3 and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement) and Ground Support Equipment. As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulation, integration and testing. Modeling and simulation allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target, and range constraints. Flight testing is periodically required for validation of modeling and simulation as well as satisfying ATEC/DOTE requirements of segment improvements.

Software and hardware improvements for threat evolution: Performs necessary analysis and development efforts to maintain PATRIOT system effectiveness against evolving threat technologies and specific threat capabilities. This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.

Upper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM): Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment. Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous engagements and missile wastage on debris.

THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability: Implements improvements to THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network deficiencies that impact Tactical Ballistic Missile battle management and force/engagement operations. Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint interoperability.

Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM): This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.

Task 2: Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2/Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3, and Missile Segment Enhancement) to counter emerging Tactical Ballistic Missile threats.
 
Task 6: Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude Tactical Ballistic Missile Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor. Longer-range detection, track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris. This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the Radar Digital Processor, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles.

Task 7: Performs analysis on existing and evolving Tactical Ballistic Missile countermeasures to determine the effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness. Develops hardware and software concepts to address countermeasure effects to ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness. Develops detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design/code/test software implementation leveraging Radar Digital Processor, Modernized Adjunct Processor, Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator and Flight Solution Computer-Redesign processing capabilities. Implements simulation based concepts to define trade space and establish system requirements.

Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT): Efforts will develop and test the military's improved Global Position M-Code with PATRIOT Major End Items (MEI) integrating the improved anti-jamming and secure access of military GPS signals. This effort meets the requirement for Assured PNT through M-Code as mandated by Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 National Defense Act, public law 111-383 &amp; 913.

Combat ID Enhancements: Develop and implement improvements to the Radar Digital Processor-Capability Combat ID capabilities and additional Non-Cooperative Target Recognition techniques to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.

Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense: Provides improved capability for PATRIOT to protect other Army and Joint Services Sensors from ARM attacks. Builds on an initial capability provided in Post-Deployment Build-7 by determining remaining gaps, identifying and evaluating alternatives, and implementing further improvements.

Tactical Telemetry Ground Station: Develops a ground-based telemetry receive station to be deployed with the tactical units and collect PAC-3 telemetry data for tactical engagements. This data will be used to assess missile and system effectiveness in tactical environments against real-world threats, and will support the development of operational improvements (Firing Doctrine and other system settings) and system software improvements to mitigate stressing threat behaviors.

PAC-3 Seeker Software Improvements: Perform PAC-3 Missile Segment Software improvements to improve missile capability to counter Electronic Attack Threats.

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The improvements/enhancements developed through the PATRIOT Product Improvement Program (PIP) are interrelated with the hardware kits that are procured and installed under the Missile Procurement, Army (MIPA) appropriation's PATRIOT Mods program and maximizes PAC-3 MSE capabilities.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system was to provide a baseline system capable of modification to cope with continuing threat evolution.  This program minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program upgrades the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability and communications, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat.  Upgrades are implemented through individual hardware and software materiel changes and fielded incrementally. This program encompasses several changes which will require the use of a variety of acquisition methods to develop, test, procure and field.  Future hardware and software capabilities will be incorporated into future Post Deployment Build (PDB) releases. Developing, fabricating, and testing hit to kill surface to air missile and associated ground support equipment provides essential increases in battle space, accuracy, lethality and firepower to counter and destroy evolving air defense threats. These state-of-the-art capabilities and enhancements require ongoing demonstration through a series of flight tests and modeling and simulation activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Fire Support Command &amp; Control (FSC2) funding line supports the Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross Functional Team (CFT), the #1 priority in the Army Modernization Strategy and the Common Operating Environment (COE). Efforts are aligned to support the Network-CFT capability set approach.  

FSC2 supports the development of Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), LRPF CFT, Extended Range Canon Artillery (ERCA), Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (ER-GMLRS), Precision Strike Missile System (PRSM) initiatives. In order to support these initiatives, AFATDS will serve as the key sensor to shooter link for the Army and USMC providing fully automated support for planning, coordinating, controlling and executing fires and effects. AFATDS also began supporting Long Range Hypersonic Weapons (LRHW) in FY 2020. Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) systems automate the planning and execution of fire support operations so that a suitable weapon or group of weapons adequately cover targets. Fire support is the effect of lethal and non-lethal weapons (fires) that directly support land, maritime, amphibious and special operation forces to engage enemy forces, combat formations, and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives. FSC2 family consists of Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS), and Precision Fires Dismounted and Mounted (PF-D/M), formerly known as Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED).

The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapons systems. As a member of the Artillery System Cooperation Agreement (ASCA), AFATDS is interoperable with coalition partner fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars). AFATDS 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS software currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army's COE, Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative,  and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction. 

Precision Fires Dismounted and Mounted (PF-D/M), is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call for Fire. PF-D answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD. PF-M answers the mounted computing environment requirement and will reside on Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS) computers.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 18 May 2015, the Milestone Decision Authority (PEO C3T) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving the PFED Increment II Milestone B. The ADM officially approved entry into the Development phase as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program. The system received a Limited Deployment Decision in Jan 2017, to enter into operational test and in Jan 2018 received Full Deployment Decision for Block 1 and Full Material Release.

PF-D/M leverages an Army Science and Technology investment by transitioning a software application that has been developed and used in proponent experimentation events (e.g. Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE) and Bold Quest). Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY15, this software application transitioned to PM Mission Command (PMMC) to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PF-D/M will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior (NW) End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PF-D/M software will be conducted by PMMC as units are fielded the capability. PF-M will be developed on the MCE baseline and co-hosted on the Military Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS).

PF-D/M is developed using a block approach where capability is incrementally added to the overall baseline over the course of four blocks. PF-D/M Block 2 focuses on transitioning from a standalone Android application to a plugin on the ATAK architecture.  Capabilities include Sensor Interoperability, Digital Precision Strike Suite, and Digitally Aided Close Air Support over the Link 16 network.  PF-D/M Block 3 focuses on the transition to the mounted environment.  This will move the PF-D Block 2 baseline onto the MFoCS, which is a complete replacement for the LFED/FOS and offers enhanced interoperability to Fire Support Sensors mounted on the platform and offer capabilities of interacting with Net-Enabled munitions.  PF-D/M Block IV will be determined by the FCoE Governance Board under the IT Box policy.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) funding line supports the Army Modernization Strategy Common Operating Environment. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team (CFT) capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy. AFATDS 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS software currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction. 

FY 2021 funding of $41.371 million will be used to facilitate development and continue to focus on the AFATDS v7.0 effort to include building fire support, fire control and fire direction role-based capabilities, integrating available CPCE common components, and updating the user interface for the Software.

AFATDS supports Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) CFT, Extended Range Canon Artillery (ERCA), Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (ER-GMLRS), Precision Strike Missile System (PRSM) and emerging sensor to shooter initiatives. To support these initiatives, AFATDS will serve as the key sensor to shooter link for the Army and US Marine Corps providing fully automated support for planning, coordinating, controlling and executing fires and effects. AFATDS began supporting Long Range Hypersonic Weapons in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AFATDS v7.0 requirement was validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) under the AFATDS Increment 2 Capability Definition Document (CDD) in June 2011.  On 13 May 2015, the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approved AFATDS as a modification to the existing program baseline, continuing as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) II defense acquisition program (DAP) (non-Automated Information System) with PEO C3T oversight.  The AFATDS 7.0 is a software only modification/modernization effort that will be hosted on already fielded hardware used for legacy AFATDS software.  

The overall acquisition approach to delivering AFATDS 7.0 is to modernize and redesign the software to create a single software baseline featuring web services and a suite of Common Operating Environment (COE) applications that meet threshold values of all key performance parameters identified in the AFATDS Increment 2 CDD.  The AFATDS Increment 2 CDD was approved under an IT Box construct, which promotes evolutionary development by facilitating requirement refinement and the incorporation of the latest technology.  While the JROC Memorandum (JROCM) 083-11 validated the AFATDS 7.0 performance parameters, it also delegated authority for identifying and approving future capability requirements that fall within the CDD's scope to the Fires Support Command and Control (FSC2) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board.  

AFATDS 7.0 will be modernized using an incremental approach where capability is added to the overall baseline over the course of five (5) blocks.  This approach provides the PM opportunity to deliver capabilities to users earlier in the process instead of waiting until AFATDS 7.0 is functionally complete, and also allows for feedback obtained during Product Validation Tests (PVTs) and Limited User Tests (LUTs) to be factored into later builds before the conclusion of the development contract.  The overall concept behind AFATDS 7.0 is to re-build AFATDS legacy software using the latest software development technologies and methodologies to ensure a strong technical foundation is in place for continued expansion of capability (to address Long Range Precision Fires initiatives) and adoption of emerging technology initiatives, such as COE.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, $356 thousand in Reimbursable Manpower for Program Element (PE) 0203735A Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs Project 330 Abrams Tank Improve Prog has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance.  Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignment.

In FY 2021, $.534 million in Reimbursable Manpower for PE 0203735A Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs Project EE2 Stryker Improvement has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance.  Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignments.  FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $14.019 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PE 0203735A Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.

The strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3rd Quarter (QTR) Fiscal Year (FY) 2011.  

The Recovery Vehicle Improvement program is a group of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) that will allow the current recovery vehicle to regain Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle as defined in the Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift and Evacuation System (HERCULES) Enhanced M88A2E1 Capability Production Document Increment 2 dated 20 January 2017.  The fielded M88A2 HERCULES lacks the necessary power, weight, and braking ability to safely support the recovery of the M1A2SEPv2 in all situations and with the next generation M1A2SEPv3 weight growth, the problem will get worse. The M88A3 HERCULES vehicles will bring back the operational capability of the single vehicle recovery. The increased winching and lifting capability accommodates all 80 ton Abrams variants. Without this increased capability, units must use two M88A2 Medium Recovery Vehicles to perform the necessary spectrum of recovery operations.  

The Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.

Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, Network Lethality, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker FoV. Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 ECP, Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades restores Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and SWaP-C lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD and CROWS-J ONS efforts addressed Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort integrates a 30mm-equipped weapon station providing, USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops, 360 Situational Awareness, and reactive armor tiles. Stryker Fire Direction Center (FDC) Variant will provide an on-the move, protective vehicle that processes voice and digital information in a timely manner while maintaining contact with the indirect fire team over extended distances. Stryker Lethality ECP efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon ECP, CROWS-J ECP, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ECP, common masted sensor ECP, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and address Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and Modified Improved Target Acquisitions System (MITAS) obsolescence issues that will impact fleet sustainment beginning in FY 2020. The ATGM ECP will upgrade the MITAS, incorporate a far target locator and disseminate target acquirement information utilizing network lethality, providing a common operating picture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift and Evacuation System (HERCULES), designated as an Acquisition Category (ACAT IC) program on 15 Jun 2016, has been providing towing, winching, and hoisting operations to support battlefield recovery operations and evacuation of heavy tanks and other tracked combat vehicles since its production and deployment in 1998. The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes M1 Abrams turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles. Currently, the M88A2 is unable to safely perform Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) of the Abrams tank in all conditions, due to added weight/survivability improvements made to the tank. In order to ensure SVR is met, Project Director- Main Battle Tank Systems (PD-MBTS) will develop and integrate Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) technologies for the M88A2 HERCULES through an Operations and Support (O&amp;S) initiative to meet its operational requirements of SVR throughout its life cycle. This initiative is not intended to exceed current operational capability, but will instead regain SVR capability of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.

Analyses conducted to date suggests that upgrades to the M88A2 track, suspension, hydraulics, engine, transmission and other related components are required to meet single vehicle recovery for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Base dollars will continue the design, development, integration, prototype build, and continue Government Systems Engineering and Program Management office support. This will include labor, training, travel, supplies, and equipment to effectively manage the program. The prototype vehicles will enter testing in FY 2022 to confirm technical solutions meet performance requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, $356 thousand in Reimbursable Manpower for Program Element (PE) 0203735A Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs Project 330 Abrams Tank Improve Prog has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance.  Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignment.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army has approved Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) for the Abrams Main Battle Tank to restore lost capability, host inbound technologies, and to meet objective performance requirements called out in approved platform requirements documents. The strategy for Abrams will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future. This approach was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3rd Quarter (Q) FY 2011.

The Abrams vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. In order to restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams. The ECPs will incorporate lost power generation and distribution technologies, lethality improvements, force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection Systems, technologies to mitigate obsolescence issues, in-bound technologies under development technologies to decrease the overall weight of the tank, and technologies in support of any validated Army requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Bradley Fighting Vehicle will continue to be a major combat vehicle in the Army Operational Force for the next 15-20 years. Current modernization efforts, such as the Track and Suspension Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and the A4 Mobility ECP, address current space, weight, and power-cooling (SWAP-C) limitations. The Bradley will continue to modernize to support additional capabilities required to counter evolving threats in multi-domain operations including, but not limited to improved vehicle diagnostics and systems to increase maintainability, mobility, survivability, sensor digitization, improved power distribution, and cyber and software improvements. These improvements increase the Bradley Fighting Vehicle's ability to survive in a cyber and electronic warfare permissive environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Current projections indicate the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Bradley Fire Support Vehicle will remain in the armored brigade combat team (ABCT) formation until the 2050s. Given this, additional Research and Development (R&amp;D) is required to keep the force relevant. The Bradley Fighting Vehicle System (BFVS) improvements implemented through the ECP Program will focus on restoring lost platform capability and provide capacity to support Army inbound technologies and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing programs of record.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, $.534 million in Reimbursable Manpower for Program Element (PE) 0203735A Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs Project EE2 Stryker Improvement has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance.  Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignments.  FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $14.019 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, Network Lethality, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades restores Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD and CROWS-J ONS efforts addressed Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the United States Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort integrates a 30mm-equipped weapon station providing, USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancements addresses evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops, 360 Situational Awareness, reactive armor tiles, and integration of emerging and existing technologies such as the Fire Direction Center requirement, Mobile Command, Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), Turreted Mortar, and other Stryker based platform solutions.  The Stryker Fire Direction Center Variant (FDC) variant will provide an on-the move capability that processes voice and digital data while maintaining contact with the indirect fire team over extended distances. Stryker Lethality ECP (30 mm medium caliber weapon, CROWS-J, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM), common masted sensor, and other capabilities) efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).  Additionally, the Lethality MEP upgrades will address existing obsolescence issues of the Remote Weapon Station (RWS) with the CROWS  and CROWS-J upgrade and Modified Improved Target Acquisitions System (MITAS) with the improved sights.  The ATGM ECP will upgrade the MITAS, incorporating a far target locator and disseminate target acquirement information utilizing network lethality, providing a common operating picture.  Upgrade of the Stryker flat-bottom hull and DVH variants to mitigate known system deficiencies.  The identified deficiencies include, but are not limited to the Mobile Gun System (MGS) and Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissnace Vehicle (NBCRV). Efforts for the Stryker Double V-Hull A1 (DVH A1) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) (formerly named Stryker ECP 1), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) (formerly named Stryker ONS Lethality), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, Stryker Lethality ECPs (formerly referred to as Stryker ECP 2) and Stryker Fire Directional Center Variant (FDC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>23 March 2018 Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) decision to exchange all remaining flat-bottom brigades results in continuing exchange production beginning in FY 2018 funded in Stryker Upgrade (G85200). Stryker MOD (GM0100) supports Stryker Fleet modifications and Lethality ECP retrofits in FY 2019-2025.

Beginning in FY 2021 the requirements and funding in the Stryker MOD (GM0100) will be moved to Stryker Upgrade (G85200).</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker ECP 1 effort will buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to eleven years of war (20-combat rotations &amp; 37+ million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and DVH variants.  In March 2013, Phase II was approved continuing design and integration of ECP 1 mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades, and the in-vehicle network upgrades.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP 1 efforts on the DVH platform and defer efforts on flat-bottom Strykers.  The effort has subsequently been renamed the Stryker DVH A1 ECP.  The DVH A1 ECP Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The initial DVH A1 ECP production contract was awarded in October 2016 (Sole-Source Firm Fixed Price arrangement).  A second and third buy of DVH A1 ECP vehicles was awarded as a Fixed Price Incentive Fee arrangement.  A March 2018 AROC decision to pure fleet the Stryker brigades to DVH with the initial approval for 6 DVH A1 brigades.  The objective acquisition strategy is to annually procure 1/2 of a brigade. 

On July 2, 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker 30mm ICVD ONS effort.  30mm ICVD Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contracts for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Logistics Products Development/Test Support were awarded in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively (Cost Plus Incentive-Fee basis).  The 30mm ICVD ONS Production/Retrofit contract was awarded in May 2016 through an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).  Definitization of the Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Production contract occurred in March 2017.

The Stryker Lethality ECP efforts will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package MEP lethality upgrades 30mm medium caliber weapon system, CROWS-J, common masted sensor, ATGM target acquisition optics, integration of emerging and existing technologies such as the Fire Direction Center requirement, Mobile Command, Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), Turreted Mortar, and other Stryker based platform solutions, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's SBCTs. Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approval to initiate the Stryker CROWS-J and ATGM ECP efforts was received in a September 30, 2016 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM). A 30mm medium caliber weapon system (MCWS) decision was made in March 2019.   The 30mm MCWS effort will award design studies to 5 vendors, evaluate the bid samples requested for production award to determine if there is a vehicle that is ready for production.  If the none of the bid samples are production ready, then additional design/development will be required beginning in FY 2021.  To improve platform survivability fleet wide, 360 Situational Awareness will be developed by integrating existing technologies, for fleet wide installation over a period of six years to allow the occupants during both open and closed hatch operations to visualize their immediate surrounding while stationary and on the move in adverse weather conditions.

In 2016, the Army approved the FDC requirement and the Field Artillery Battalion TAC using excess Flat Bottom Hull  (FBH) Stryker during Force Design Update (FDU) process.  Following the March 2018 Pure fleet AROC decision, Force Design Division (FDD) identified the Double V Hull A1  (DVH A1) as the platform for the FDC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The current Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1C Acquisition program which consists of the Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and the Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT). The PIM Improvement Program is intended to address the current Howitzer capability gap based on a capability needs assessment performed by the user community to restore indirect fires support overmatch to the United States Army. This effort will evaluate developing technologies to determine which configuration will add optimal value to the Army. This effort will consist of multiple increments to spiral technology as it matures and may include, but is not limited to mobility, survivability, reliability, supportability, and lethality upgrades such as the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) modernization effort to integrate a new cannon, gun mount, gun drive systems, fire control systems, autoloader, and optionally-manned capability into a Howitzer platform. Analysis will be required to evaluate the impact of the new cannon technology and modifications required to support ammunition automation, remote firing, and remote movement on the vehicle chassis, cab, suspension, mobility, and electronic architecture. This effort will develop, evaluate, build, and test prototypes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MQ-1C Gray Eagle provides the Army with an extended range, multi-purpose (ERMP) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS); capable of executing reconnaissance, security, attack, and intelligence collection missions in the range of military operations (ROMO). Sensors/payloads include an Electro-Optical/Infrared/Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD), Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and HELLFIRE missiles; providing a near all-weather mission capability. MQ-1C Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission UAS fielded to all Army Divisions, Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities within multi-domain battle operations.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Aircraft Modification/Product Improvement funding of $11.7 million will both greatly enhance propulsion reliability and mitigate obsolescence. The current MQ-1C Gray Eagle engines can no longer be procured.  Additionally, this propulsion reliability effort will reduce MQ-1C Gray Eagle Return to Base events and decrease the likelihood of engine related aircraft mishaps. This modernization effort will increase operational readiness and posture Gray Eagle to support multi-domain.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An ERMP Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005. Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 2009.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOTE) on 12 Jun 2015.

This RDTE element funds a propulsion reliability improvement with the development of the Heavy Fuel Engine (HFE) 2.0 engine system.  The current MQ-1C aircraft engine has experienced material failures that have resulted in aircraft mishaps (loss of aircraft) and a high number lost flight hours due to Return to Base (RTB) events.  HFE 2.0 implements aviation grade components and focused reliability improvements that will address previous material failures and RTB drivers.  Additionally, the Army was notified by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that the current engine core is obsolete and the current manufacture will no longer supply the engine core.   HFE 2.0 also resolves this obsolescence/supply issue.  In 2018, the Army issued an RFI to industry to assess the state of engine technology and availability of a COTS/NDI engine solution that could meet MQ-1C capability needs and requirements.  The primary goal of the RFI was to establish an alternative engine for MQ-1C that is reliable and could be integrated and qualified in a two year timeframe to resolve critical reliability and supply issues with the current engine.  Upon completion of the RFI evaluations, an industry day event was held with all vendors to answer questions and gain additional information from each potential vendor in key areas such as reliability, cost and schedule.   As a result of the Army's RFI and Industry day event, it was determined that the HFE 2.0 was the only engine to meet requirements for an alternative MQ-1C engine.  Funded RDTE elements will support completion of integration, test, and qualification of the HFE 2.0 engine system on the MQ-1C aircraft.  This effort will secure engine supply and result in greater propulsion system reliability and increased operational readiness to the commander in the field.  Funds are planned for award on the Gray Eagle Technical Services contract as a Technical Services Memorandum (TSM) task order, and as a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requisitions (MIPRs) to various other Government agencies.  Upon completion of qualification, HFE 2.0 engine systems will be procured under the PBL contract and fielded through attrition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Instrument the Hunter turbochargers and exhaust manifolds, and provide support for in-flight testing to acquire data for turbocharger lifing analysis to support of airworthiness, readiness, reliability, and safety of the Hunter aircraft.  UAV Hunter turbocharger investigation at the U.S. ARL VTD at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  Also provides research to support airworthiness, reliability and performance improvements of Hunter UAV turbocharger. An alternate turbocharger is required to support airworthiness, reliability and performance of Hunter UAS engine.  The Hunter UAS has experienced ?Soft Rotation? due to the aircraft?s inability to achieve an engine speed sufficient for take-off (i.e. insufficient thrust). The increased frequency in soft rotations during take-off increases the risk of potential damage to equipment or injury to personnel due to the potential for the aircraft to depart the runway after rotation rather than taking flight.  Testing has demonstrated that the current turbocharger is operating very close to the surge limit.  The engine calibration limits turbocharger speed.  However, there is no potential for an increase in performance with the currently installed turbocharger.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As the Army Equipping methodology transitions to the Army Modernization Enterprise or AME the information technology used to support Army Equipping must grow and change.  The development of an upgraded Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) will integrate and share programming data (dollars and quantities) with information from IT systems that support the Army Futures Command (AFC), ASA(ALT), ASA(FM&amp;C) and Army G3/5/7.  This data sharing will allow the AME to provide Army Senior Leaders with  a complete picture of how well programs are executing, the impacts of programming decisions on Army current and future readiness and modernization, and help develop a road map needed to transition the current force to a fully modernize Army.  The AE2S next generation capability requirements include a flexible data and software architectures that allows the user to integrate disparate data from differing architectures in order to develop new information that can be turned into actionable knowledge by senior leaders.  The software architecture must have data visualization capabilities that allow the user to display data in ways that can articulate how AME decisions made impact warfighting effectiveness and plans.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As the Army Equipping methodology transitions to the Army Modernization Enterprise or AME the information technology used to support Army Equipping must grow and change.  The development of an upgraded Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) will integrate and share programming data (dollars and quantities) with information from IT systems that support the Army Futures Command (AFC), ASA(ALT), ASA(FM&amp;C) and Army G3/5/7.  This data sharing will allow the AME to provide Army Senior Leaders with  a complete picture of how well programs are executing, the impacts of programming decisions on Army current and future readiness and modernization, and help develop a road map needed to transition the current force to a fully modernize Army.  The AE2S next generation capability requirements include a flexible data and software architectures that allows the user to integrate disparate data from differing architectures in order to develop new information that can be turned into actionable knowledge by senior leaders.  The software architecture must have data visualization capabilities that allow the user to display data in ways that can articulate how AME decisions made impact warfighting effectiveness and plans.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Avenger is a lightweight, ground-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle. The system protects against unmanned aircraft systems, cruise missiles, and fixed and rotary wing threats. Avenger provides day/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability. It can be air dropped, lifted by helicopter and is air transportable. The system employs up to eight Stinger missiles to counter aerial threats and a M3P gun for close-in ground and air threats. An Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system aids in the identification of friendly aircraft in order to minimize the potential for fratricide. The Avenger fleet of 453 systems includes 169 systems that are equipped with a digital Slew-to-Cue (STC) capability to speed target detection and engagement.

The Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) consists of Project 038: Avenger Production Improvement Program (PIP) and Program Element CE8710: Avenger MODS. The ongoing MOD-SLEP addresses obsolescence of Avenger components to ensure Avenger maintains operational capability through Fiscal Year (FY) 2031. Five key MOD-SLEP components are: the Targeting Console (TC), the .50 Caliber Machine Gun (M3P), the Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC), the Mode 5 IFF and the Vehicle Internal Communications (VIC-5). Additional Obsolescence Mitigation Items include Avenger Organizational Maintenance Tool Kits, AN/PSM-95 Electronic Systems Test Set and the Avenger Remote Handheld Terminal Unit mounting kits.

The Avenger MOD-SLEP is fielded in two phases. Phase I fields the TC to 169 STC Avengers. Phase II fields the AFCC (169 STC Avengers), VIC-5 and the Mode 5 IFF. The M3P will be fielded through attrition. The TC and AFCC are fielded to the 169 STC Avenger variants only. 

FY 2021 funding of $1.288 million ensures that several Avenger components are viable and sustainable through the end of program life. This includes the initial investigation of technologies that will provide Assured Positioning Navigation and Timing capability, including the Anti-Jam Antenna and DAGR Distributed Device (D3), which will provide M-Code capability. Avenger MOD-SLEP maintains operational capability of Avenger until FY 2031.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It can be air dropped, lifted by helicopter and is air transportable. The system employs up to eight Stinger missiles to counter aerial threats and a M3P gun for close-in ground and air threats. An Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system aids in the identification of friendly aircraft in order to minimize the potential for fratricide. The Avenger fleet of 453 systems includes 169 systems that are equipped with a digital Slew-to-Cue (STC) capability to speed target detection and engagement.

The Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) consists of Project 038: Avenger Production Improvement Program (PIP) and Program Element CE8710: Avenger MODS. The ongoing MOD-SLEP addresses obsolescence of Avenger components to ensure Avenger maintains operational capability through Fiscal Year (FY) 2031. Five key MOD-SLEP components are: the Targeting Console (TC), the .50 Caliber Machine Gun (M3P), the Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC), the Mode 5 IFF and the Vehicle Internal Communications (VIC-5). Additional Obsolescence Mitigation Items include Avenger Organizational Maintenance Tool Kits, AN/PSM-95 Electronic Systems Test Set and the Avenger Remote Handheld Terminal Unit mounting kits.

The Avenger MOD-SLEP is fielded in two phases. Phase I fields the TC to 169 STC Avengers. Phase II fields the AFCC (169 STC Avengers), VIC-5 and the Mode 5 IFF. The M3P will be fielded through attrition. The TC and AFCC are fielded to the 169 STC Avenger variants only. 

FY 2021 funding of $1.288 million ensures that several Avenger components are viable and sustainable through the end of program life. This includes the initial investigation of technologies that will provide Assured Positioning Navigation and Timing capability, including the Anti-Jam Antenna and DAGR Distributed Device (D3), which will provide M-Code capability. Avenger MOD-SLEP maintains operational capability of Avenger until FY 2031.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project DZ9 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Mods was previously funded under Program Element (PE) 0604768A Project P01 Multi-Mode Seeker Development and Test in addition to Strategic Capabilites Office (SCO) funding.  Program transitions from the demonstration to product maturation and rapid fielding starting in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021. 

Project VT9 Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) is a new start in FY 2021.

Project VV2 TOW is a new start in FY 2021.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>ATACMS is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary all-weather, surface-to-surface long-range artillery precision guided missile used by Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard &amp; soft targets in open, complex, and urban environments.

DZ9: Cross Domain (CD) ATACMS is a new variant which integrates a seeker into the ATACMS to expand its capabilities to allow it to search, detect, acquire and engage moving maritime and land targets. This capability is being developed as a SCO demonstration project scheduled to complete in Quarter 2 FY 2021. FY 2021 - FY 2023 funding matures and transitions this capability to the Army to provide a limited deployment to a combatant command in support of the Land Based Anti-Ship Missile Operational Needs Statement (ONS 17-22222).

Funding supports performance analysis, testing, and qualification of the CD ATACMS system design; integration with the command and control system; integration with the launcher; and system safety and supportability requirements necessary for a limited fielding.

VT9: Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) is a New Start Project. LMAMS is a single man-portable/operable, light-weight organic, beyond line-of-sight, precision guided, loitering aerial missile system capable of locating and engaging obscured and/or fleeing enemy targets that otherwise cannot be engaged by typical direct fire weapon systems.

Funding supports engineering and integration of capability improvements identified by trained operators during an Assessment of Operational Utility (AOU) conducted in 2018. Once integrated into the current LMAMS, Production Verification Testing will be conducted to demonstrate successful incorporation of new technology.

VV2: The TOW Weapon System includes the Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) launcher, TOW missiles (BGM-71 series), and associated tactical training aids/devices. The TOW Weapon System provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Army Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT), Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and Armor Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT) within the Active, Reserve, and National Guard components. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) employs the TOW missile from its ITAS derived M41A7 Saber launchers, anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) vehicles, and AH-1W Cobra helicopters. 

The TOW Weapon System improvement program is a New Start Project to integrate US Army missile and ITAS modifications into the TOW Weapon System to improve missile safety (Insensitive Munition upgrades), increase system survivability (counter active protection systems), and increase system network capabilities. These capability improvements support Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) and the Functional Concept for Movement and Maneuver by providing precise lethal capabilities in multiple domains against armored threat systems. 

FY 2021 Base dollars in the amount of $16.984 million will initiate systems engineering to integrate an improved Insensitive Munitions (IM) propulsion system, which will increase missile range, and add a Counter Active Protection System (CAPS) to the TOW missile to enhance missile safety and survivability. The effort will also initiate analysis of requirements for supporting test equipment, launcher, modeling and simulation hardware/software, and test planning for FY 2021.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>After successfully completing operational testing of the height of burst capability via proximity sensor, the Milestone Decision Authority approved in FY 2019 the production and cut in of this capability for unitary missiles.  Insensitive munitions and M-code requirements will be addressed by the Army's follow-on long range missile program, Precision Strike Missile.  This completes all planned ATACMS missile efforts under 788 ATACMS PIP.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all-weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments. Cross Domain (CD) ATACMS is a new variant which integrates a seeker into the ATACMS to expand its capabilities to allow it to search, detect, acquire and engage moving maritime and land targets. This capability is being developed as a SCO demonstration project scheduled to complete in Quarter 2 FY 2021. FY 2021 - FY 2023 funding matures and transitions this capability to the Army to provide a limited deployment to a combatant command in support of the Land Based Anti-Ship Missile Operational Needs Statement (ONS17-22222).  

Funding supports performance analysis, testing, and qualification of the CD ATACMS system design, integration with the command and control system, integration with the launcher, and system safety and supportability requirements necessary for a limited fielding. CD ATACMS prior year funding from FY 2018 to FY 2020 was under PE 0604768A Brilliant Anti-Armor Submunition (BAT) Project P01 P01 MULTI - MODE SEEKER DEVELOPMENT AND TEST.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This is a new start in FY2021.

Project VT9 Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) is a new start project in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>VT9: Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) is a single man-portable/operable, light-weight organic, beyond line-of-sight, precision guided, loitering aerial missile system capable of locating and engaging obscured and/or fleeing enemy targets that otherwise cannot be engaged by typical direct fire weapon systems.

Funding supports engineering and integration of capability improvements identified by trained operators during an Assessment of Operational Utility (AOU) conducted in 2018. Once integrated into the current LMAMS, Production Verification Testing will be conducted to demonstrate successful incorporation of new technology.

New start project in FY 2021.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Project VV2 TOW is a new start in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project VV2 TOW Weapon System includes the ITAS launcher, TOW missiles (BGM-71 series), and associated tactical training aids/devices. The TOW Weapon System provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Army Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT), Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and Armor Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT) within the Active, Reserve, and National Guard components. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) employs the TOW missile from its ITAS derived M41A7 Saber launchers, ATGM vehicles, and AH-1W Cobra helicopters. 

The TOW Weapon System improvement program is a New Start Project to integrate US Army missile and ITAS modifications into the TOW Weapon System to improve missile safety (Insensitive Munition upgrades), increase system survivability (counter active protection systems), and increase system network capabilities. These capability improvements support Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) and the Functional Concept for Movement and Maneuver by providing precise lethal capabilities in multiple domains against armored threat systems. 

FY 2021 Base dollars in the amount of $16.984 million will initiate systems engineering to integrate an improved Insensitive Munitions (IM) propulsion system, which will increase missile range, and add a Counter Active Protection System (CAPS) to the TOW missile to enhance missile safety and survivability. The effort will also initiate analysis of requirements for supporting test equipment, launcher, modeling and simulation hardware/software, and test planning for FY 2021.

Supports Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) Multi-purpose Guided Missile (MPGM) requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety &amp; Occupational Health is the designated Executive Agent for the Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) program. Defined by the DoD Directive 4715.1E, the EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety, and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting, and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders. Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to continue to develop and modernize the platform to meet Army and DoD policy-driven cloud computing and cybersecurity requirements. Prior to funding being committed, DoD ESOH stakeholders and authoritative information technology organizations were consulted to determine necessary system interface upgrades to be incorporated. Expanding DENIX's architecture to create a Level 2 container separate from the current Level 4 container will not only provide a more secure, cybersecurity risk-adverse environment, but it will also optimize performance, capabilities, and mandatory reporting for ESOH stakeholders using a PaaS delivery model. This phased solution begins in FY 2018 by prototyping of system architecture optimization that improves user experience, enabling web conferencing in FY 2019 and applying machine learning concepts to improve data quality in FY 2020-2022.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware, software, interceptors (PAC-2, Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PAC-3 and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement) and Ground Support Equipment. As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulation, integration and testing. Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints. Flight testing is periodically required for validation of the modeling and simulation as well as satisfying Army Test and Evaluation Command/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (ATEC/DOTE) requirements of segment improvements. The Lower Tier AMD System line also supports identification, analysis, design, and test materiel solutions to counter cyber security and electronic warfare shortcomings to all elements of the Lower Tier Battle Space.

PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.

Program Element (PE) 0205456A Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense (AMD) System funding will be realigned to PE 0607865A Patriot Product Improvement beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, to PE 0607865A Patriot Product Improvement and C12101000 Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor beginning of FY 2022.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This program is an integral part of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The ongoing design and developmental activities enable modeling and simulation infrastructure maintenance and upgrades coupled with end to end testing of the Lower Tier architecture against the evolving threat as an element of an integrated Air and Missile Defense system. This strategy minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  Lower Tier system development efforts enable further improvement of system capabilities against emerging and reactive threats.  Developing, fabricating and testing hit to kill surface to air missile and associated ground support equipment provides essential increases in battle space, accuracy, lethality and firepower to counter and destroy evolving air defense threats. These state-of-the-art capabilities and enhancements require ongoing demonstration through a series of flight tests and modeling and simulation activities.

Beginning in FY 2021, these efforts will be funded through PE 0607865A Patriot Product Improvement.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Guided Multiple-Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  The GMLRS Program currently consists of multiple variants: GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) which has been developed as a non-cluster munition to engage the same target set as GMLRS DPICM. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy. GMLRS Unitary and AW are currently in full rate production.

The 26 October 2016 Deputy Secretary's Management Action Group (DMAG) directed the Army to define and execute an effort for GMLRS modifications that would extend the maximum range (Extended Range (ER) GMLRS) and integrate sensors and seekers into the rocket to engage complex targets with greater precision at greater ranges.  These modifications to GMLRS were designated by the Army Acquisition Executive as an engineering change proposal (ECP) and not as a new start effort.

The GMLRS program will continue to leverage ongoing Government and Industry research and development efforts to extend range, increase survivability, and enhance lethality.  The EG2 funding line will enable the seeker modification.  The EG3 funding line enables GMLRS enhancements, including ER GMLRS modification, statutorily required upgrades, and  obsolescence mitigation and upgrades.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army initially funded the development of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) increment under the EG2 - GMLRS Alternative Warheads project code. GMLRS AW entered full rate production in 2015. The 26 October 2016 Deputy Secretary's Management Action Group (DMAG) directed the Army to define and execute an effort for a GMLRS modification that would integrate a seeker into the rocket.

Funding identified in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 - FY 2022 will support the technology transition, development, and demonstration of a seeker into the GMLRS and will help define a common seeker solution for the entire MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM). The modification to integrate a seeker will leverage the Extended Range (ER) GMLRS and culminate in a proof of concept demonstration of the seeker capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army continues to explore ways to enhance Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets and common components and to mitigate obsolescence issues under Project EG3 Guided MLRS. The Army is requesting funding for the following GMLRS Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) activities: (1) evaluation of enhanced operational capabilities to provide more flexibility across the target set to include increased range, flight performance, and end-game optimization; (2) investigation of potential life cycle cost savings through obsolescence initiatives and second source qualification; (3) development of enhancements to the MLRS common test equipment; (4) evaluation and development of technologies to enhance overall product performance and survivability to include Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); and (5) system test and evaluation.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 dollars in the amount of $61.060 million will continue the design, qualification, and testing of an extended range variant of the GMLRS; and continue qualification of key rocket obsolescence upgrades.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Project EG3 Guided MLRS is intended to support, investigate, and develop alternative material changes to improve the GMLRS family of munitions as they are identified by the material developer or combat developer. This project also supports Insensitive Munitions (IM) activities to improve the overall posture of the system down to component level.  The ER GMLRS effort is pursuing a strategy of modifying the current GMLRS system through the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) process in order to increase its range. ER GMLRS is a development and qualification effort performed as a modification to the current GMLRS, leveraging existing contract vehicles where practicable.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT III program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 
JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM), constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is used as an institutional trainer though is available as a deployable asset.  JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. On 14 January 2016, the Army Acquisition Executive designated the JTAGS Pre-Planned Product Improvement (JTAGS P3I) program as a separate ACAT III modification program.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  P3I Improvements upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and improves warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 is complete. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite delivering critical capabilities sooner. Phase 2 Spiral 1 and Spiral 2 will be completed in FY 2020. 

FY 2021 requested funding of $9.510 million will allow for the integration of  evolving cyber hardening advances, emerging threats, and planning of a JTAGS P3I Block II operational test.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This program element develops critical software intensive improvements, while continuing to make maximum use of Non-Developmental Items (NDl)/Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  After design and integration, the system will be subject to thorough developmental and validation/verification testing to verify performance, operational effectiveness and suitability. P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, improving warning tactical parameters and timeliness. The acquisition of the JTAGS Block II effort is being performed under contract W9113M-12-C-0055, awarded 23 Aug 2012. The contract's development efforts are Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), and the contract's production is Firm Fixed Price (FFP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

Project 491: Army CIO/G6 manages Project 491

Project 491: Information Assurance (IA) Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks. This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan (AMSP).  

IA Development funding implements and establishes functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and IA capabilities in coordination with the NSA, the DISA, and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI). Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future material solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. Develop and publish the COMSEC Implementation Planning Guidance to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of CS capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data in accordance with the Army Network Campaign Plan. This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS, System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) for Army Capability Sets for CS/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks.

Project 491 FY 2021 Justification:  This funding supports the continuation of providing oversight for the executions of the Army's COMSEC Modernization initiatives including major ACC updates and replacements of existing devices and systems to meet NSA mandates. Continue to support the evaluation and testing of new technologies for Army implementation in support of CM2, KMI migration and S-ICAN/ITN architecture implementation. Support efforts to provide updated end-to-end, tactical-to-strategic COMSEC standardization and implementation guidance to meet Army's operational requirements. to assess new key management technologies developed by DoD joint KMI program to determine the maturity for Army fielding to protect and strengthen the Army Network posture. and to work with DoD CIO, NSA, DISA and other Services to resolve cryptographic interoperability issues for both embedded and standalone systems and performed risk reduction testing of commercial products prior to insertion into Army for use to increase operational availability with documented operational value and rapid integration. Provide timely test and evaluate results to enable the Army to make sound investment strategic decisions and to reduce or eliminate duplications. Also supports efforts to update and develop policies to posture Army's operations to implement innovative cryptographic and key management tools and services. and to participate in DoD and Army working groups to develop plans for CM2 implementation. Perform System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) to provide protections for the Army Integrated Tactical Networks.

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems. Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield. It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics. Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access. The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems.

Project DV4 &amp; DV5: COMSEC is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. These efforts are consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG). These funding lines support the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

Project DV4: The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) KMI ACAT IAM program, automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution. AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute Cryptographic data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence (C5I) systems. AKMI devices receive, store, manage, and transfer electronic key through the network to be loaded into communication devices such as radios and satellites to secure the network. Without this technology Warfighters are required to manually receive their cryptographic products by traveling to COMSEC account locations (which may not be co-located) and manually fill their devices. 

Project DV4 FY 2021 Justification: This funding line supports COMSEC technologies within the Army with allocations for the following: $1M, Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE) to create a secure, reprogrammable cryptographic engine in providing Cryptographic Modernized Capabilities including future Over the Network Keying (OTNK) to Fill Devices and End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s; $12.346M to perform the systems integration and UAS development for the Next Generation Load Device - Medium (NGLD-M) to conduct the Army's key fill mission by issuing, filling, and managing Cryptographic keys to both legacy and future KMI aware End-Cryptographic Units (ECUs). This technology requires RDT&amp;E investment to meet the requirements outlined in the NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD). This effort an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) Program of Record (POR); $0.111M to Program Management Support, funds a matrixed Acquisition Program Manager (APM) from Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center to manage the NGLD-M development effort.

Project DV5: Crypto Modernization (Crypto Mod) performs test, evaluation, development, and configuration management for cryptographic devices that receive key through fill devices and allow for secure communication through Army devices such as radios and satellite terminals. This program utilizes National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks. The effort supports network operations from end-to-end throughout the force and the Common Operating Environment (COE) thus mitigating networked vulnerabilities to Army information security systems. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required be upgraded to modern algorithms to meet emerging threat developed by our adversaries. Crypto Modernization necessitates the utilization of the latest NSA cryptographic capabilities in order to defeat adversarial efforts to decrypt, disrupt, or exploit US Army networks. COMSEC is the Army's implementation of NSA protections to create a unified network that is protected, resilient, and survivable.

Project DV5 FY 2021 Justification: The program continues testing and evaluation of COMSEC devices to confirm capability and interoperability on Army networks and tactical systems as well as identifying risk areas for compliance with COMSEC regulations and procedures. The program will test and evaluate Crypto Systems compliant devices, Suite B IPSec devices built on commercial standards, Cryptographic High Value Product (CHVP), Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Guidance, and new software releases to High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) 4.X devices in accordance with AR 700-142 Revision dated 8 June 2018. The program tests interoperability and provides ways to insert Data At Rest (DAR) and Data In Transit (DIT) technology within the existing and future network infrastructure. Additionally, this program evaluates performance of technologies and provides direction to ensure the lowest impact on performance while providing the greatest protection from loss of sensitive data.

Project ET9: Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) program was canceled FY 2018. No FY 2021 funding is requested.

Project FF8: User activity monitoring (UAM) automation/analytics will provide technical capability to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

Communications Security (COMSEC) is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms.

As part of the Army's Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) implementation, the Next Generation Load Device - Medium (NGLD-M) is an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) Program of Record (POR) and modernized load device that will replace approximately 144,000 legacy AN/PYQ-10A and AN/PYQ-10A(C) (Army), which is commonly referred to as the Simple Key Loader (SKL). The NGLD-M will receive, store, manage, and transfer electronic key through the network to be loaded into communication devices such as radios and satellites to secure the network. The SKL has been in the field for 14 years and does not support modernized network concepts and faces battery life attrition among early versions of the device. The NGLD-M will fulfill the current and modernized Army network concepts which will improve operational readiness, adaptiveness, and survivability of the Warfighters supporting the COMSEC requirements for approximately 1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (devices that consume cryptographic key to enable encrypted communication such as a radio or secure phone). The NGLD-M requires RDT&amp;E investment to develop and test the hardware and software solutions to meet the operational requirements outlined in the NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) to modernize fill devices with capability to transfer and receive cryptographic key over a network to reduce causalities and maintain mission OPTEMPO. Without this technology Warfighters are required to manually receive their cryptographic products by traveling to COMSEC account locations (which may not be co-located) and manually filling their devices. 

The Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE) is a government owned reprogrammable cryptographic chip that incorporates KMI functionality and modern algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages for the embedding. This chip could be adapted for use within the NGLD-M or any other cryptographic communications system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Aspects of the Next Generation Load Device - Medium (NGLD-M) may include commercially availability solutions and/or interfaces, but development is required to integrate these solutions into a device that meets the rigors of NSA Type 1 certification and the Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements. There is no commercially driven market for Type-1 certified load devices that meet the requirements identified in the NGLD Family CPD. These requirements ensure secure communications by requiring the NGLD-M to provide specific tamper protections, limit electromagnetic radiation to prevent adversarial detection of the system, among others outlined  within the Information Assurance Security Requirements Document. The NGLD-M acquisition also supports organic development of the User Application Software to reduce the life-cycle sustainment for the system. 

Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) consists of Programs of Record (POR) as well as Non PORs under Project Lead Network Enablers (PL Net E). AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record. The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks such as radios, secure phones, and satellite terminals.

AKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12. The AKMI Program will include the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family.

The NGLD family of devices will become the primary Army Tier 3 component of the AKMI Program. The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 3 devices (small, medium and large) to meet the AKMI requirements. The AKMI program has partnered with Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the government owner Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE) that can be utilized by NGLD-M or other COMSEC devices. The NGLD-M will undergo full-and-open competition for development, production, and sustainment with a projected FY20 award. NGLD-M development will be conducted during FY19-22 culminating in NSA certification and an operational event. 

The Milestone Decision Authority issued a Materiel Development Decision (MDD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 14 March 2019 that designated the NGLD-M as an ACAT III Program of Record (PoR) and authorized execution of Fiscal Year 2019 RDT&amp;E funds for acquisition planning and risk mitigation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project DV5, Crypto Modernization (Crypto Mod), supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy. Communications Security (COMSEC) is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510.

Crypto Mod performs test, evaluation, development, and configuration management for cryptographic devices that receive key through fill devices and allow for secure communication through Army devices such as radios and satellite terminals. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required be upgraded to modern algorithms to meet emerging threat developed by our adversaries. Crypto Modernization necessitates the utilization of the latest National Security Agency (NSA) cryptographic capabilities in order to defeat adversarial efforts to decrypt, disrupt, or exploit US Army networks. Communications Security (COMSEC) is the Army's implementation of NSA protections to create a unified network that is protected, resilient, and survivable.

To accomplish this multi-faceted effort, consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan, Crypto Mod performs evaluation of emerging threats, development of advances protections to defeat these threats, testing of commercial and government off the shelf applications developed to provide protections against identified threats, and assessment of new software and hardware updates to these end user devices and software to ensure they remain hardened against cyber-attack. This ensures that all endpoints from singular NIPRNET, SIPRNET, JWICS and Intelligence workstations in the strategic Enterprise to Tactical vehicles and equipment utilized by dismounted personnel forward deployed in hot zone are protected when processing the critical mission and voice data that provides the strategic overmatch required to accomplish the Army's mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Cryptographic Systems program integrates and validates hardware and software solutions to provide COMSEC superiority in order to protect against threats, increase battlefield survivability/lethality, and enable critical Mission Command activities. The objective of the Crypto Mod program is to provide adaptive, flexible, and programmable cryptographic systems using best practices, lessons learned and programmatic management to meet the challenge of modernizing the Army's aging cryptographic systems. To support this objective, the Cryptographic Systems Program utilizes NSA contracts in order to procure devices. All existing and emerging encryptors are then tested and evaluated for Functionality, Security, Interoperability, and backward compatibility on software and hardware for both Tactical and Enterprise systems and assessments of new software and hardware updates to end user devices and software to ensure they remain hardened against cyber-attack. The effort will support the network operations from end-to-end throughout the force and the Common Operating Environment (COE) thus mitigating networked vulnerabilities to Army information security systems.

                                <r2:Remarks>$2.000M in FY19 funding was returned to the PEO mid-year as excess. FY18 funding originally turned in for recission was partially returned to CS late FY18 and was utilized to pay CCDC C5ISR S&amp;TCD labor in FY19, resulting in the $2.000M excess FY19 funding being returned. FY21 Plan: No planned excess funding for FY21
Envision, Aberdeen, Maryland is a subcontractor under CACI; FY19 and FY21 funding is captured on the CACI line.
Embedded Crypto Modernization Support was cancelled.</r2:Remarks>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project ET9, Embedded Crypto Modernization (Crypto Mod) supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Lines of Effort (LOE) 1 Network Enablers Functions.

Modernize the AN/ARC-201D Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems (SINCGARS) to meet CJCSI mandated cryptographic requirements through the execution of an engineering change effort to provide a bridging radio solution for Army Aviation rotary wing platforms. Support the Unified Network key near term imperative of achieving air-ground integration. Crypto modernization will ensure compliance with Key Management Infrastructure (KMI), add algorithms that address cyber vulnerabilities, improve 'secure but unclassified' network support, and provide better support to coalition interoperability.

Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms. Tactical radios using legacy embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>GCSS-Army Increment 1 gives combat forces a decisive edge by providing soldiers a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible, and secure logistics information to get combat power at the right place, at the right time.  The GCSS-Army program is an information and communications technology investment that provides key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force.    GCSS-Army implements best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of The Army Campaign Plan.  

GCSS-Army Increment 2 builds on the current foundation by providing auditable Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities and will sunset legacy systems:  the Aircraft Notebook and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS).   Increment 2 will deliver greater efficiencies to Aviation Logistics warfighters and improved information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers, helping them make better decisions faster on the battlefield.   The APS capabilities directly impact the speed at which a deploying unit can draw combat equipment.

The FY 2020 funding provides for the engineering, design, development, and integration of GCSS-Army Increment 2 into the Increment 1 baseline.  It also supports critical change requests, coming from the warfighter and prioritized by the Combat Developer, for the baseline system.

The FY 2021 funding provides for the continuation of engineering, design, development, integration, and testing of the GCSS-Army Increment 2.  The funding also builds edge software for disconnected supply, maintenance and accountability, leveraging the Increment 2 architecture and revised technical approach approved in FY 2019.  The FY 2021 funding also supports trade studies, analysis and market research for SAP based ERP integration, consolidation and efficiencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GCSS-Army Increment 1 provides critical Army sustainment support to the soldier with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible, and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge and is essential for combat readiness. GCSS-Army implements best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of The Army Campaign Plan.  GCSS-Army is financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise Strategy to be financially auditable.  
The FY 2021 funding builds edge software for disconnected supply, maintenance and accountability, leveraging the Increment 2 architecture and revised technical approach approved in FY 2019.  The Army requires a single disconnected operations architecture for GCSS-Army to support the ground and aviation missions.  Currently the Army has battlefield gaps without network connectivity:  inability to maintain or regenerate combat power, order/process spare parts, track battle losses, or conduct maintenance.  The disconnected operations architecture, using FY 2021 RDTE funding, will alleviate these problems when there are disruptions in communications or cyber-attacks.  The FY 2019 and FY 2020 funding also supports critical change requests, coming from the warfighter and prioritized by the Combat Developer, for the baseline system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Currently the Army has battlefield gaps without network connectivity:  inability to maintain or regenerate combat power, order/process spare parts, track battle losses, or conduct maintenance.  The FY 2021 funding builds edge software for disconnected supply, maintenance and accountability, leveraging the Increment 2 architecture and revised technical approach approved in FY 2019.   The disconnected operations architecture, using FY 2021 RDTE funding, will alleviate these problems when there are disruptions in communications or cyber-attacks.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>FY 2021 funding was increased above the FY 2020 level to fund the first year of a two year development effort for disconnected ground operations.  FY 2021 funding will cover all design and development efforts to develop the edge software and front end user interface screens to allow soldiers to operate disconnected.   This is a critical requirement validated by Army in order to regenerate combat power, order/process spare parts, track battle losses, or conduct maintenance when there are disruptions in communications or cyber-attacks.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCSS-Army will design and develop the edge software for disconnected ground operations tapping into the technical architecture that is being developed in Increment 2, Army Enterprise Aviation.  The program will design and build user screens for disconnected supply, maintenance and accountability, leveraging the core framework that will already be established in another part of the program.  The Army will use a single disconnected operations architecture for GCSS-Army to support the ground and aviation missions.  

The program office (INC 2) will award a base year contract with 3 option years in FY 2020, using a Department of Defense Enterprise Software Initiative (DoD ESI) contract, to design and
develop the core architecture that will be used for disconnected ground and aviation operations. In FY21, utilizing the DoD ESI contract, the program will start to design and develop the core architecture that will be used for disconnected ground operations leveraging aviation architecture. 

GCSS-Army will also leverage the partnership with the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command, and supplement the design and development team with architecture and engineering support from the existing support contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GCSS-Army Increment 1 gives combat forces a decisive edge by providing soldiers a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible, and secure logistics information to get combat power at the right place, at the right time.  The GCSS-Army program is an information and communications technology investment that provides key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. GCSS-Army implements best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of The Army Campaign Plan.  

GCSS-Army Increment 2 builds on the current foundation by providing auditable Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities and will sunset legacy systems:  the Aircraft Notebook and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS).  Increment 2 will deliver greater efficiencies to Aviation Logistics warfighters and improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers, helping them make better decisions faster on the battlefield.   

In FY 2019, the AAE approved a new technical approach for Enterprise Aviation, which will utilize a commercial disconnected architecture capability from SAP, called Agile Deployed Operations (ADO).  ADO will allow the Army to extend the fully integrated Enterprise Aviation capability to a disconnected platform and will provide timely and accurate visibility and accountability of materiel down to the unit level. ADO developed under the Enterprise Aviation effort will also serve as the foundation for disconnected ground operations.  Enterprise Aviation will replace a legacy standalone client server architecture and integrate its functionalities into an enterprise system. 

Implementation of the BI/BW capabilities provide enhancements in materiel and supply chain readiness analytics that are critical to inform commanders' understanding of weapons systems readiness, helping them make better decisions faster on the battlefield. 

The APS capabilities directly impacts the speed at which a deploying unit can draw combat equipment while reducing the burden of the day-to-day maintenance and accountability of APS stock.  
The FY 2021 funding will continue design, development, and incremental testing for Enterprise Aviation capability in the GCSS-Army baseline software; will continue to develop the SAP disconnected operations technical architecture; and will begin development to re-platform the Aircraft Notebook in order to sunset this legacy system.  FY 2021 RDTE funds will also allow the Army to develop critical maintenance, supply and financial reports that will be used for Enterprise Aviation and key functional areas in order to improve readiness reporting.  Finally, FY 2021 funding will address the requirements to allow units to quickly draw APS stocks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Briefed the evaluation results to stakeholders and Army Senior Leadership. On 4 June 2019, the AAE approved the Revised Technical Approach to the GCSS-Army Aviation Logistics program - rather than a middleware capability to bridge the gap between SAP and Microsoft software languages, the program will pursue a pure SAP development approach along with the SAP Agile Deployed Operations solution for Disconnected Operations. The Program Office initiated execution of the revised technical approach (technical deep-dive complete and Blueprinting ongoing)

Release 1 also delivers Master Data capabilities ACN platform. The PM will demonstrate that production/deployment design is stable, the design will meet stated and derived requirements based on acceptable performance in developmental test events, provide mature software capability consistent with the software development schedule, incur no significant production risks, and demonstrate interoperability and operational supportability. Release 1 will complete full deployment  in early FY 2021. The PM will develop EAVN Release 2 primarily focusing on the disconnected Agile Deployed Operations (ADO) capability that Army Aviation requires. PM will finalize designs for product support elements and integrate them into a comprehensive product support package ready for production and deployment.

BI/BW elements related to data visualization, reporting and data analytics will complete software development. PM will finalize designs for product support elements and integrate them into a comprehensive product support package ready for production and deployment in early FY 2021.

Additional BI/BW capabilities associated with realizing further enhancements in business intelligence, common operating picture and data analytics across the Army logistics enterprise will begin software development to include system design and a series of design reviews prior to test article fabrication and/or software build or coding.</r2:Text>

Re-platforming will allow the Army to sunset the ACN legacy system and its standalone client server architecture. 

Implementation of GCSS-Army Wave 2 BI/BW reporting capabilities will provide enhancements to materiel and supply chain readiness with an additional capability to perform self-service analytics. The analyses will provide critical information to commanders' on weapons systems readiness enabling them to make quick decisions on the battlefield. BI/BW reporting will provide visibility and associated costs of materials and equipment, at the tactical and national levels, for Supply, Maintenance, Property Book functions, helping to improve lifecycle management and auditability. 

As directed, following an FY 2020 gap analysis, APS development will include integration of worldwide APS business processes to include conduct of operational assessment of APS in order to operationalize logistics management of APS overseas to improve readiness posture.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCSS-Army Increment 2 continues the evolutionary acquisition strategy of Increment 1 and will define, develop, and deploy additional and enhanced capabilities to GCSS-Army based upon proven technology, time-phased requirements, projected threat assessments, and demonstrated manufacturing capabilities. The program office will award a base year contract with 3 option years in FY 2020, using a Department of Defense Enterprise Software Initiative (DoD ESI) contract, to design and develop the core architecture that will be used for disconnected ground and aviation operations.  This same contract vehicle will also be used to build the edge software for disconnected supply, maintenance and accountability. 
GCSS-Army will also leverage the partnership with the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command, and supplement the design and development team with architecture and engineering support from the existing support contract.

GCSS-Army Increment 2 is being implemented in three waves:

Wave 1 provides the Army Enterprise Aviation logistics capability. Government System Integrator is the Combat Capability Development Command (CCDC) Aviation and Missile Center, System Simulation and Software Integration (S3I) Directorate.. Department of Defense (DoD) Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) blanket purchase agreement (BPA) contract will be awarded in 2020.

Wave 2 provides the enhanced BI/BW capability. Contract was awarded June 2019.

Wave 3 provides the APS capability.  Contract award TBD.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) funding has been realigned to 0303142A from 1203142A in FY 2021 and out.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 253, Dscs-Dcs (Phase II), SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 - Unified Network.  Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

FY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $4.376 million develops Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated Mission Command Network and Systems requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, military departments, Department of State and other government departments and agencies.

Project 456, MILSATCOM System Engineering supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network.  Efforts are aligned to support the Network Cross-Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

456 - MILSATCOM System Engineering assures the tactical Army satellite communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-the-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide.  MILSATCOM System Engineering shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes.  MILSATCOM System Engineering represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial and International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces.  These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.

Project 456 also includes Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM efforts, which fill a critical communications gap for anti-jam SATCOM capability for mobile ground forces conducting expeditionary operations in electronically contested environments.  It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement.  It will offer the tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional.  These efforts are synchronized with the Air Force and DoD's plans for Protected Tactical Waveforms (PTW) on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), the Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS), and commercial SATCOM systems.

Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM is a continuation of efforts previously funded under the MILSATCOM System Engineering (1203142A/FE2) and Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (1203142A/FI8) lines.  MILSATCOM System Engineering supported development and testing of prototype PTW modems during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) in FY 2019.  Protected Tactical Anti-jam SATCOM supported initial development, testing and certification of production representative PTW modems, incorporating Army specific requirements, to support continued spiral development of critical protected communications capabilities to address resiliency in jamming environments in FY 2020.

FY 2021 funding supports the systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with Joint SATCOM development efforts.  This line continues to fund the systems architecture and analysis for current and future SATCOM efforts in both wideband and protected satellite communications.  This effort includes collaborative work with the Air Force on the prototype Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem development and testing during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD).  It also funds system engineering efforts the Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) program which will test the PTW modem over Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) as well as Protected Tactical SATCOM (PTS), which is the next generation satellite constellation.  Funding includes the Network Centric Waveform Tool (NCWT) development and testing and other efforts that have impacts on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations.

FY 2021 funding also supports continued collaborative development, testing and certification with the Air Force of critical protected tactical capabilities.

MILSATCOM System Engineering (0303142A/456) funding is a realignment of funding from MILSACTOM System Engineering (1203142A/FE2) and Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (1203142A/FI8).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and
risk management framework support. Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and
upgrades which improves SATCOM gateway resiliency while allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities. Both the Wideband SATCOM
Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain
Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C. Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current
trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into WSOMS and EWSTS
systems. Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology
insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband Satellite System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System
(DSCS) satellites in the future. Contracting approach for new technology is through the use of Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) and Other Transaction Authority

Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (0303142A/456) is a continuation of efforts previously funded by the Army under PE 1203142A - SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) MILSATCOM System Engineering (FE2) and Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (FI8).

Previous funds under MILSATCOM Systems Engineering (1203142A/FE2) supported development and testing of prototype Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modems and Protected Tactical Satellites (PTS) during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) (FY 2019).

Previous funds under the Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (1203142A/FI8) supported initial development, testing, and certification of production representative PTW modems, incorporating the Army specific requirements to support continued spiral development of critical protected communications capabilities to address resiliency in jamming environments.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network.  Efforts are aligned to support the Network Cross-Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

MILSATCOM System Engineering assures the tactical Army satellite communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-the-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide.  MILSATCOM System Engineering shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes.  MILSATCOM System Engineering represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial and International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces.  These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.

MILSATCOM System Engineering includes Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM efforts, which fill a critical communications gap for anti-jam SATCOM capability for mobile ground forces conducting expeditionary operations in electronically contested environments.  It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement.  It will offer the tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional.  These efforts are synchronized with the Air Force and DoD's plans for Protected Tactical Waveforms (PTW) on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), the Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS), and commercial SATCOM systems.
Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM is a continuation of efforts previously funded under the MILSATCOM System Engineering (1203142A/FE2) and Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (1203142A/FI8) lines.  MILSATCOM System Engineering supported development and testing of prototype PTW modems during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) in FY 2019.  Protected Tactical Anti-jam SATCOM supported initial development, testing and certification of production representative PTW modems, incorporating Army specific requirements, to support continued spiral development of critical protected communications capabilities to address resiliency in jamming environments in FY 2020.

FY 2021 funding supports the systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with Joint SATCOM development efforts.  This line continues to fund the systems architecture and analysis for current and future SATCOM efforts in both wideband and protected satellite communications.  This effort includes collaborative work with the Air Force on the prototype Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem development and testing during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD).  It also funds the system engineering efforts associated with the Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) program, which will develop, test, and enable PTW communications over Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) as well as Protected Tactical SATCOM (PTS), which is the next generation satellite constellation.

FY 2021 funding also supports continued collaborative development, testing and certification with the Air Force of critical protected tactical capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

All Fiscal Year 2020 base funding will support Defense Readiness Reporting capabilities.  The Defense Readiness Reporting System-Army (DRRS-A) is the Army's Authoritative Readiness Reporting System. This information technology system provides unit readiness reporting, unit registration and force planning and projection activities to enable Title 10 reporting to Congress. Specifically this funding will provide additional system enhancements and testing to support emerging developmental requirements to satisfy the Army's and Joint readiness reporting capabilities along with ensuring interoperability of Army and Joint Systems. DRRS-A is the Army's critical enabler which directly enables the Quarterly Readiness report to Congress.

Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A): This project is the Army component of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Family of Systems (FoS). GCCS-A has transitioned into sustainment.

Army Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 provides Army leaders: Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and Coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

All Fiscal Year 2020 base funding will support Defense Readiness Reporting capabilities.  The Defense Readiness Reporting System-Army (DRRS-A) is the Army's Authoritative Readiness Reporting System. This information technology system provides unit readiness reporting, unit registration and force planning and projection activities to enable Title 10 reporting to Congress. Specifically this funding will provide additional system enhancements and testing to support emerging developmental requirements to satisfy the Army's and Joint readiness reporting capabilities along with ensuring interoperability of Army and Joint Systems. DRRS-A is the Army's critical enabler which directly enables the Quarterly Readiness report to Congress.

Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A): This project is the Army component of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Family of Systems (FoS). GCCS-A will transition into sustainment in FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) was designed to consolidate legacy broadcasts into an interoperable set of broadcasts that can carry threat warning and situational data to both users and producers. The requirement for IBS is documented in the Integrated SIGINT Information Mission Needs Statement (MNS) validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Memo (JROCM) 115-95 on 15 September 1995. The JTT program is an effort to provide common tactical terminals capable of receiving and transmitting into the IBS UHF broadcasts. The House Permanent Select Committee for Intelligence (HPSCI) requested an IBS Implementation Plan, which was approved by the Assistant Secretary for Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) (ref (i)) on 24 October 1995. The JTT was included as part of the solution in the Implementation Plan.  The JTT program Operational Requirements Document (ORD) was signed on 24 September 1996.  Subsequent updates in March 2005 and November 2017 were made to reflect changes in interoperability/Net Readiness certifications and Post Milestone C enhancements respectively.  Additional fact of life administrative changes were made and the updated ORD was signed on 25 April 2018.  The JTT is integrated into platforms that have a requirement to interact (transmit and/or receive) with the IBS Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB).  JTT is a post-Milestone C program. The legacy IBS Terminals will reach sustainment end-of-life in FY2025.  The procurement of a post-Milestone C replacement was initiated to replace the end-of-life systems, leverage updated technology, and enable flexible configurations to meet Joint customer operational needs. The procurement for a modernized Non-Developmental Item terminal will access multiple vendors by leveraging competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 11A Advanced Payload Develop &amp; Spt (MIP): The Advanced Payloads Development project is a shared funding line between multiple payload programs. These payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. 

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infrared / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery and the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons. It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for the Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities. Current product improvements continue to focus on the development and implementation of Target Location Accuracy (TLA) and Tactical Awareness Improvement (TAI) capabilities that directly support emerging requirements of the Army's Current and Future Force.     

Small TActical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) provides the Gray Eagle UAS with multi-functional SAR/MTI and Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) cross-cueing capabilities for the detection, classification and location of stationary and moving vehicle and man-sized targets.

Project 11B: Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) provides the Gray Eagle UAS with radio frequency (RF) emitter detection, recognition, and geo-location capabilities.

Project 123 Joint Technology Center System Integration: The UAS Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts. The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises. The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements. This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Acquisition Category (ACAT) III - Electro Optical / Infrared / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides Standard Definition (SD) or High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums. These systems provide day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery and the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons. It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for the Gray Eagle UAS which supports intelligence gathering, force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities. Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 base dollars in the amount of $0.146 million and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) dollars in the amount of $34.1 million will fund product improvements to enhance CSP lethality through enhanced Target Location Accuracy (TLA) and usability through Tactical Awareness Improvement (TAI). TLA provides validated, precision geolocation data for real-time targeting by coordinate-seeking weapons, reducing the kill chain timeline from minutes to seconds. TAI provides the warfighter enhanced situational awareness of the battlefield thru full spectrum imaging, aided target recognition, and simultaneous targeting.

Small TActical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) provides Gray Eagle UAS multi-functional SAR/MTI and EO/IR cross-cueing capabilities for the detection, classification and location of stationary and moving vehicle and man-sized targets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The MQ-1 Payloads (MIP) (SSN A01001) includes the MQ-1 sensor payloads: Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) (SSN A01003), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) (SSN A01004), and Common Sensor Payload Full Motion Video (CSP FMV) (A01005).</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CSP EO/IR/LD enables the Gray Eagle to meet KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirements. The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in November 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. Full Rate Production (FRP) was achieved in June 2013. A three (3) year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) activities. The Enhanced EO/IR Capability Production Document, approved 19 December 2016, defines additional KPP requirements for FMV sensors. The first KPP increases detection, recognition, and identification requirements which can only be met with the HD variation of the CSP. Currently, units are being fielded HD CSPs, with additional HD CSPs in production and retrofit. The second KPP requirement is for the CSP to be a metric sensor providing rapid and enhanced TLA. A five (5) year follow-on production and system support contract was awarded in 2019 for integration, test, upgrade, and sustainment of these enhanced capabilities. The FY 2021 acquisition strategy for CSP includes the continuation of developmental and operational  testing supporting CSP-TLA requirements and the maturation of hardware and software product improvements and prototype development supporting CSP-TAI requirements.

STARLite SAR/MTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS. The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. FRP was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform. STARLite updated its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results. This software update maximized user efficiency through automation of common tasks and upgraded to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE). The SPE software enhancements simplified user interface, reduced operator workload, and enhanced operator effectiveness. A competitive RDT&amp;E funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and began the development of the software improvements. Integration onto the Gray Eagle was done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that supports UAS and RPA programs within the Joint Services by providing the system engineering, test and integration, interoperability, rapid technology insertion and develops training capability to include the MUSE/AFSERS system. This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE/AFSERS Enhancements

The Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) is the DoD simulation/training system for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), RPA, and ISR systems. MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force Application. The MUSE/AFSERS is a software suite that simulates ISR &amp; strike systems, tailored air vehicle &amp; data links, and visualization systems used for payload product outputs-including Full Motion Video (FMV), Fixed Frame Imagery (FFI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data, and Link 16 (J2.2 and J3.5) tracking messages. Outputs are compliant with applicable DoD standards and are continually tested against actual ground ISR processors to ensure interoperability with over 40 systems within DoD.

The MUSE/AFSERS creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) refinement, practice Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) of intelligence information, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize tactical operations within warfighting exercises and experiments.  MUSE/AFSERS is currently in use across Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the MUSE/AFSERS provides National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) images for associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of PED. The MUSE/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations. Most of the components of the MUSE/AFSERS software suite are also used in multiple UAS RPA system training devices including those for the RQ-7 [Shadow], MQ-1C [Gray Eagle], M/RQ-5 [Hunter],  MQ-9 [Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical (MALET) JSIL Aircrew Trainer (MJAT)] and RQ-4 [Global Hawk Sensor Operator Part Task Trainer (GHSOPTT) and Global Hawk Weapon System Trainer (WST)].

This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Continued movement towards standards based solutions, e.g. Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI), which facilitated optimal interoperability and an IG agnostic framework with which to integrate with various IGs.  Continued specific integration of Night Vision Image Generator (NVIG) and Virtual Reality Scene Generator (VRSG) into the Modeling &amp; Simulation domain as it pertains to UAS simulation, terrain and model development.  Continued support of annual/bi-annual theater level Exercises (Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG), Yama Sakura (YS) and Key Resolve (KR), Talisman Saber (TS), Pacific Sentry -2 &amp; -3, as well as 5 other Exercises coming online, Integration Events (IEs) and Validation Events (VEs).  Continued improvement of mapping capability for mission planning.  Continued redesign of Windows Entity Server (WES) and NetLink to improve network routing and large PDU data feeds (i.e. ? 7 million+), thus lessening bandwidth consumption. Continued development of a Heads Up Display (HUD) designer application that will allow for the creation and modification of HUDs without having to touch the software baseline thereby reducing costs and increasing fidelity and speed of solution in theater. Continued implementation of generic 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) application that will allow for creation of new platforms without modifying code; again a reduction in costs and increased solution delivery velocity. Continued architecture optimization, to facilitate extensibility and scalability, to maintain readiness for growth of M&amp;S requirements coming from the Services.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's newest generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the United States (U.S.) Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT). Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.  

Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 in accordance with the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8). Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.

The RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is a fixed-wing, airborne COMINT and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) collection and precision targeting location system. GRCS provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify/identify high value targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army INSCOM Aerial Exploitation Battalions providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. The Army's Acquisition Objective/Army's Procurement Objective is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd Ml; and seven (7) fielded to the 204th Ml, and five (5) trainers within TRADOC and INSCOM. Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.

GRCS is the only Army AISR system that currently provides extended range COMINT and ELINT capabilities to support long range targeting of near-peer threats in an A2AD environment. 

Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and procurement funding currently planned will address obsolescence issues for critical SIGINT and ELINT capabilities on the GRCS platform. These investments ensure GRCS AISR support in the A2AD environment is not impacted, which would prevent critical intelligence collection at large standoff which is needed to address long range targeting of near-peer threats and maintain system relevancy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This funding line supports non-recurring engineering (NRE), development of type certificates (TC), testing, integration of Modifications in Service of Army Aerial, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) systems and engineering analysis/studies/structural modifications to substantially increase EMARSS (King Air B300) payload capacity and time on station. Funding provides for the integration of Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving International Standards. It also enhances aircraft communications, navigations and surveillance (CNS); aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) and the integration of the AISR mission equipment package (MEP) as well as obsolescence issues and commonality with the EMARSS Program of Record (POR) aircraft.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's newest generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the United States (U.S.) Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT).

This funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter:  Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) Radar; Line-Of-Site (LOS) and Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. 

Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding in the amount of $6.290 million continues the development of sensor enhancements through SIGINT software porting and development of new SIGINT software focusing on new signal sets applicable in a near peer environment. This funding also initiates SIGINT architecture development to exploit additional signals of interest relative to MDO, and a SIGINT server leveraging development of other services and facilitating rapid and continuous integration of capabilities targeting emerging signal sets and threats. This SIGINT architecture development work continues through FY 2025.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The supporting procurement lines are A02112 and AZ2054. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy, supported by the EMARSS CPD, is to provide enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: EO/IR FMV; COMINT; WAAS; LiDAR and improved SAR/MTI radar; LOS and BLOS communications; and PED supporting two DCGS-A enabled operator workstations. The EMARSS fleet of 24 systems consists of the following variants: eight EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four EMARSS-S (SIGINT).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the United States (U.S.) Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Base funding of $16.575 million will fund the development of the Long Range Radar Electronic Protection Measure software which will allow the Long Range Radar to support the warfighter in a contested electromagnetic spectrum. This funding line also continues the new signal enhancement development effort to complete Signal 3 and begins the development of software to enhance the COMINT collection capabilities with the lab and flight test for Signal 5 to meet the requirements in the ARL-E CPD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Long Range Radar testing was originally planned for FY 2018, however, the testing was delayed due to an unscheduled radar repair and completed in FY 2019.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 OCO funding of $14.000 million continued the new signal enhancement development effort for Signal 3 and 4 to develop software to enhance
the COMINT collection capabilities. This funding line supports continued software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities to effectively prosecute high
priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The ARL-E Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts are found in the following two (2) project lines; 0305206AEH4 ARL ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH5 ARL Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02110 and AZ2050. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne Intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E CPD requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), EO/IR FMV, COMINT, on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through DCGS-A Enabled workstations.  This includes software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities. The software will be added to existing COMINT systems to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is an airborne Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Collection and Location System capable of providing Tactical Commanders Near-Real Time intelligence. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify/identify critical targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) United States (U.S.) Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. In accordance with the Army's AISR 2020 strategy, the Army's Acquisition Objective/Army's Procurement Objective (AAO/APO) is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd MI BN; seven (7) fielded to the 204th MI BN, and five (5) pilot trainers to support Force Generation. The five (5) trainers are not equipped with Primary Mission Equipment (PME).

GRCS Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding request in the amount of $3.996 million supports GRCS advanced signal enhancement efforts, development and testing of the signal enhancement infrastructure for GRCS updated SIGINT sensor capabilities.  GRCS is the only Army AISR system that currently provides extended range COMINT and ELINT capabilities to support long range targeting of near-peer threats in an A2AD environment.  RDTE and procurement funding currently planned will address obsolescence issues for critical SIGINT and ELINT capabilities on the GRCS platform. These investments ensure GRCS AISR support in the A2AD environment is not impacted, which would prevent critical intelligence collection at large standoff which is needed to address long range targeting of near-peer threats and maintain system relevancy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Distributed Common Ground Systems - Army (DCGS-A) was formerly designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced commercial capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of software capability drop releases will be provided into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.

DCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI).  

DCGS-A provides technologically advanced Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  

FY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $47.204 million for D07, DCGS-A, will be used for modification, testing and integration of commercially available technologies to support multi-source intelligence processing at all echelons, as directed in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 113 and Section 220 that will increase the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability to meet the Army requirements. DCGS-A will focus on Capability Drop upgrades and modifications to prototype and integrate Intelligence Applications into the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) and within a cloud computing environment.  Intelligence Applications will begin in FY 2021 with an All-Source Intelligence and collection management capability to streamline and simplify the intelligence process at the tactical echelons, in a fast-paced multi-domain environment.   DCGS-A will also begin Next Generation Analytics preparation activities to include market research, studies, and evaluations for the following applications: Open Source (OSINT) applications, Counter Intelligence and Human Intelligence Reporting capabilities (CI/HUMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) analysis, Intelligence Support to Cyber Operations, and Geospatial analytics capabilities.  Activities will include the exploration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms, and will leverage opportunities for integration into DCGS-A.   DCGS-A will also assess solutions to replace the aging Tactical Entity Database with a new database solution at the tactical echelons, fully integrated into CPCE.  In FY 2021, DCGS-A will evaluate a new sensor downlink solution to consolidate the capabilities of the legacy Tactical Ground Station, Operational Ground Station, Remote Ground Terminal and AMDAS Dissemination Vehicle onto a single platform with updated commercial technologies and to keep pace with emerging high altitude and space sensor technologies.  The program will evaluate Capability Drop-2 solutions and design and develop alternative Industry software solutions to process and fuse space, aerial, and terrestrial sensor data to produce targeting solutions for long-range precision fires.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCGS-A program will consist of multiple capability drops structured to meet DCGS-A User requirements.  The DCGS-A program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively provide and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment/hardware, providing low risk, efficient, time- phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army's operational needs.

The DCGS-A capabilities under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the future DCGS-A requirements set. The DCGS-A will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.

DCGS-A is a collection of software packages (COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data. DCGS-A delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon's intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons.  DCGS-A provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.

The DCGS-A software baseline will be updated and iteratively deployed to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements. PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, will  align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk integration and test cycle times. As requirements are approved, DCGS-A will leverage commercially-available solutions and non-developmental items (NDI) to meet user needs, based on market research results.   DCGS-A will issue commercial contracts or conduct NDI technology transitions from DoD Science and Technology organizations, or will re-use NDI from other Army programs, Services, or other Governmental Agencies. The DCGS-A software will be hardware agnostic so that the software can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment. This allows the DCGS-A software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons. The implementation of the latest COTS hardware procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, will result in significant cost efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005.  Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD), version 8.7 was approved on 17 Jul 15.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.  On 14 Jul 2015, the trigger Configuration Steering Board (CSB) concurred with the Course of Action (COA) to validate the revised requirement for the Echelons Above Division (EAD) Gray Eagle and grant authorities through a new Acquisition Decision memorandum (ADM) to pursue the extended range capable Gray Eagle configuration.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range is an enhanced derivative of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS and closes the capability gap by delivering extended surveillance coverage which supports Army RSTA missions in excess of 34 hours.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range's increased performance provides the capacity for multi-intelligence payloads, precision strike capability, and reconnaissance in support of Special Operations Forces (SOF), Mission Command from Aerial Intelligence Brigade (AIB) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).  The Gray Eagle Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) acquisition strategy emphasis will be to complete Developmental test events (Environmental, E3, Transportability, software and Air Vehicle Performance Tests) to define and address system risks, followed by an FOTE II for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Rucksack Portable Unmanned Aircraft System (RPUAS) Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (FoSUAS) provides battalion and below ground maneuver elements with critical situational awareness and enhanced force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnaissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the FoSUAS products.

The RPUAS FoSUAS provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements with an organic, on-demand, asset to develop situational awareness, enhance force protection, and secure routes, points, and areas. The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnaissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.  The RPUAS FoSUAS includes a combination of three separate hand-launched mission specific configurable aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery. The three separate mission specific configurable Unmanned Aircraft (UA) are the Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR)), the Medium Range Reconnaissance (MRR), and the Long Range Reconnaissance (LRR).  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable handheld ground control station (H-GCS) which incorporates the Tactical Open Government Owned Architecture (TOGA).  FoSUAS will utilize existing RQ-11 in a system of systems fielding concept, with Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) and Long Range Reconnaissance (LRR) options under development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (FoSUAS) provides battalion and below ground maneuver elements with critical situational awareness and enhanced force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the FoSUAS products.

The RPUAS FoSUAS provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements with an organic, on-demand, asset to develop situational awareness, enhance force protection, and secure routes, points, and areas. The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnaissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.  The RPUAS FoSUAS includes a combination of three separate hand-launched mission specific configurable aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery. The three separate mission specific configurable Unmanned Aircraft (UA) are the Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR)), the Medium Range Reconnaissance (MRR), and the Long Range Reconnaissance (LRR).  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable handheld ground control station (H-GCS), which incorporates the Tactical Open Government Owned Architecture (TOGA).  FoSUAS will utilize existing RQ-11 in a system of systems fielding concept, with Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) and Long Range Reconnaissance (LRR) options under development.

FY 2021 funding has trasferred from Program Element (PE) 0305232A RQ-11 UAV to PEs 0604101A Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) (6.4) Project BR6 Small Unmanned Aircraft System (6.4) and 0605205A SUAV (6.5) Project BR7 Small Unmanned Aircraft System (6.5).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The RQ-7Bv2 Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (TUAS) provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), and Force Protection. In line with the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) three Shadow Platoons are being integrated into the 11 Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) Apache Reconnaissance Battalions. This will provide Aviation Brigades with Manned- Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) and enhanced Aerial Scout capabilities. The RQ-7B Shadow has logged approximately 1,225,000 flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).

The full Shadow system consists of four air vehicles with payload, two Universal Ground Control stations, two Universal Ground Data Terminals, one Portable Ground Control Station with Portable Ground Data Terminal, Ground Support Equipment, two launchers, ten High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with trailer(s), and a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle. Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by Regional Logistics Points. The baseline fielded payload was the electro-optic infrared (EO/IR), but half of those have been replaced with a Laser Designator
(LD) payload. An Improved Payload for Shadow, selected by Product Manager Electro-Optic/Infrared (PdM EO/IR), will be integrated and qualified in FY 2019-2020. 110 of 115 Shadow systems required by the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) have been resourced.

Justification: FY 2021.  Zero funding submitted.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors. The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS. A successful Milestone II Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) was conducted 21 Dec 99 and a Milestone III Decision was reached on 25 Sep 02. The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 02 and in FY 2009 the last of the authorized 104 systems was placed on contract. Continued development of the selected Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (TUAV) system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Shadow v2, Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Block III engine, and reliability upgrades. Development/ integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on a competitive technical services contract with Shadow contractors. Development of the Block III engine was accomplished through a competitive process. Management responsibilities of the TUAV RQ-7B variant EO/IR/LD payload was transferred from Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation to PEO Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (IEW&amp;S) on 14 Feb 17. This was done in accordance with (IAW) ASA(ALT) memorandum titled: Transfer of Army Office of Primary Responsibility and Program Management Responsibility for RQ-7B Shadow EO/IR/LD. An Improved Payload for Shadow, competitively selected by PEO IEW&amp;S - Product Manager Electro-Optic/Infrared (PdM EO/IR), will be integrated and qualified in FY 2019-2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC) is the replacement for the Biometrics Automated Toolset - Army (BAT-A) Program of Record (POR) which has been supporting overseas contingency operations for over 19 years, well beyond the standard 3 to 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.  NXGBCC supports all three objectives of the National Defense to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation, and improve business practices.  NXGBCC initiates the data flow to the DoD Authoritative Biometrics Identification System (ABIS) and Military Intelligence systems.  NXGBCC consists of an expeditionary biometric data management system called the Local Trusted Source (LTS), biometric static collection kits with palm and credential badge capability, and biometric mobile collection kits.  NXGBCC will tactically collect, match, store, reference, and share biometric signatures and contextual data while providing data analysis capability at all echelons; enabling forces in competition, armed conflict, and re-competing in a Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) environment.  NXGBCC processes Enemy Prisoners of War (EPWs), Displaced Persons, and Refugees.  It also assists Operations in the Support in Consolidation Areas.  NXGBCC enables commanders to protect their force, deny enemy movement, increase freedom of maneuver, protect civilian populations, manage detainees identities, and to defeat near-peer unconventional threats.  FY 2020 funding for NXGBCC previously reflected in project BI7 was moved to project FL5.
  
Identity Intelligence Analytic Repository (I2AR) will serve as an analytical tool to produce, manage, and disseminate the DoD Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) as well as extend opportunities for system and data integration with enhanced analytic data sharing across the Army and Intelligence Community (IC) partners.  Analysts will use I2AR to conduct analysis and develop intelligence reports, in support of DoD and national community missions.  I2AR will include the legacy Biometrics Identity Intelligence Resource (BI2R) functionality as well as elasticity, encryption, and open source software for enduring interoperability with DoD, IC, and external partners.

Justification:
Prior year funding for NXGBCC was previously included within project BI7.  For FY 2020, NXGBCC funding is now reflected within project FL5.  The $2.000 million of FY 2020 Base Funding in FL5 will complete the prototype selection process via the Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) started in FY 2018.  The program office will  complete operational testing, interoperability testing, and New Equipment Training (NET) development.

The FY 2020 OCO of $2.214 million in BI7 will continue to support the development of new software code &amp; associated testing to deliver the Identity Intelligence Analytic Repository (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by DoD's intelligence analysts to create products such as the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) and other worldwide missions) on cloud computing platforms.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The NXGBCC acquisition strategy is to leverage the limited development of mature commercial technology to meet NXGBCC's collect, store, match, analyze, and share requirements and interface with the Biometric Family of Systems.  The program office is using the Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) competitive prototyping process to down-select to the best biometric prototype solution.  Upon OTA completion, NXGBCC will conduct the Initial Operational Test, procurement, fielding, and sustainment of NXGBCC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC) is the replacement for the Biometrics Automated Toolset - Army (BAT-A) Program of Record (POR) which has been supporting overseas contingency operations for over 19 years, well beyond the standard 3 to 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.  NXGBCC supports all three objectives of the National Defense to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation, and improve business practices.  NXGBCC initiates the data flow to the DoD Authoritative Biometrics Identification System (ABIS) and Military Intelligence systems.  NXGBCC consists of an expeditionary biometric data management system called the Local Trusted Source (LTS), biometric static collection kits with palm and credential badge capability, and biometric mobile collection kits.  NXGBCC will tactically collect, match, store, reference, and share biometric signatures and contextual data while providing data analysis capability at all echelons; enabling forces in competition, armed conflict, and re-competing in a Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) environment.  NXGBCC processes Enemy Prisoners of War (EPWs), Displaced Persons, and Refugees.  It also assists Operations in the Support in Consolidation Areas.  NXGBCC enables commanders to protect their force, deny enemy movement, increase freedom of maneuver, protect civilian populations, manage detainees identities, and to defeat near-peer unconventional threats.  FY 2020 funding for NXGBCC previously reflected in project BI7 was moved to project FL5.

Justification:
Prior year funding for NXGBCC was previously included within project BI7.  For FY 2020, NXGBCC funding is now reflected within project FL5.  The $2.000 million of FY 2020 Base Funding in FL5 will complete the prototype selection process via the Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) started in FY 2018.  The program office will  complete operational testing, interoperability testing, and New Equipment Training (NET) development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) develops, demonstrates, and transitions manufacturing processes that enable improvements in producibility and affordability of emerging and enabling components and subsystems of Army ground and air platforms, Soldier systems, weapons systems, air &amp; missile defense systems, and sensors and electronics. Initiatives within the PE result in cost savings and reduced risk of transitioning military-unique manufacturing processes into production. Project E25 fosters the transfer of new/improved manufacturing technologies to the industrial base, including manufacturing efforts that have potential for high payoff across the spectrum of Army systems.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command; and the Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT), Huntsville, AL.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line Of Effort (LOE) 1:  Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

FE1: Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS)/Digital Communications System (DCS) (Phase II):
This project develops Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated Mission Command Network and Systems (MCNS) requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations.

FE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (SE):
Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.

Program funding has been realigned to MILSATCOM System Engineering (0303142A/456) beginning in FY 2021.

FE4 / Enroute Mission Command:  
Mission Description and Budget Item Justification:
Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective. The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.

Due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku FISA FOC (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC.

FI8:  Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (Protected SATCOM) will fill a critical protected communications gap for anti-jam SATCOM capability for mobile ground forces conducting expeditionary operations in electronically contested environments.  It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against potentially catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement. It will offer the Tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional. The effort includes development of a critical Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem which will be integrated into Army tactical SATCOM terminals to provide higher throughputs, protection (anti-jam) against Electronic Warfare (EW), and resiliency in a contested environment; development of a dual small form factor modem that can run the PTW and the current Network Centric Waveform (NCW) to Army Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs) and eventually Army Corps, Division, and Brigade Combat Teams; and development, testing and certification of prototype Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminals which will augment existing AEHF terminals. The PTW efforts are synchronized with the Air Force and DoD's plans for PTW on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) the Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS), and commercial SATCOM systems.

In FY 2020, new start development of an Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototype will begin. The new terminal will augment the existing capability of the Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) AEHF terminal, with the intent to backfill decreasing SMART-T numbers post FY 2025. This ensures the Army's ability to meet increasing EW threat requirements. It will provide AEHF protected SATCOM capability in a modular, more transportable, vehicle agnostic form factor, providing greater flexibility on the battlefield. The terminal will be built with the intent to migrate from the AEHF constellation to the PTS constellation.

Program funding has been realigned to MILSATCOM System Engineering (0303142A/456) beginning in FY 2021 to support Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM development, engineering, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and risk management framework support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which improves SATCOM gateway resiliency while allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into WSOMS and EWSTS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband Satellite System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.  Contracting approach for new technology is through the use of Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network.  Efforts are aligned to support the Network Cross-Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

FE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces.  These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.

FY 2019-2020 funds the systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the implementation of the recommendations from the Protected SATCOM Communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This line continues to fund the systems architecture and analysis for current and future SATCOM efforts in both wideband and protected satellite communications.  This effort includes collaborative work with the Air Force on the prototype Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) development and associated modem testing.

In addition, FY 2019-2020 funding covers the Narrowband Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) follow-on study efforts, Network Centric Waveform Tool (NCWT) Development and Testing and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations.

FY 2021 funding was realigned to 0303142A - SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) / 456 - MILSATCOM System Engineering.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective.  The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.  

Ku FOC was achieved in September 2017 as directed by MDA due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019 and program was restructure in December 2015. A Modification Work Order (MWO), adding Ka Fixed Installed Satellite Antenna (FISA) capability began in FY 2018.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The continued procurement of the EMC full operational capability follows DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 12, 31 Aug 18 update (formerly DoDI 5000.02, 7 Jan 2015, Enclosure 13, Rapid Fielding of Capabilities). The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and project manager will tailor and streamline program strategy based on the required timelines to meet urgent need capability requirements. The Army Executive Agent signed an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 27 April 2015 delegating MDA to PEO C3T.  The MDA signed an ADM on 11 May 2015 selecting the KuKa Antenna and Radome for the Full Operational Capability (FOC). An ADM was signed on 20 May 2015 granting approval to enter into production and deployment phase.  

Ku FOC was achieved in September 2017 as directed by MDA due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019 and program was restructured in Dec 2015. A Modification Work Order (MWO), adding Ka Fixed Installed Satellite Antenna (FISA) capability began in FY18.

Initial Operational Capability met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Node (KEN).  FOC is 35 C-17s, eight Key Leader Enroute Node (KEN), and 24 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN), and a Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Node (CASPAN).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network.  Efforts are aligned to support the Network Cross-Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

FI8: Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM (Protected SATCOM) will fill a critical protected communications gap for anti-jam SATCOM capability for mobile ground forces conducting expeditionary operations in electronically contested environments. It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against potentially catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement. It will offer the Tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional. The effort includes development of a critical Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem which will be integrated into Army tactical SATCOM terminals to provide higher throughputs, protection (anti-jam) against Electronic Warfare (EW), and resiliency in a contested environment; development of a dual small form factor modem that can run the PTW and the current Network Centric Waveform (NCW) to Army Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs) and eventually Army Corps, Division, and Brigade Combat Teams. The PTW efforts are synchronized with the Air Force and DoD's plans for PTW on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), the Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS), and commercial SATCOM systems.

FY 2020 funds will continue collaborative development, testing and certification with the US Air Force and Navy of a PTW modem and a Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS). The prototype of a protected modem and protected satellite were previously funded under the FE2 MILSATCOM Systems Engineering during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD). The PTW modem and the accompanying satellite constellation continue the spiral development of critical protected communications capabilities. The funding on FI8 Protected SATCOM incorporates the Army specific requirements to be included in these efforts.

FY 2020 funds will start efforts to test commercial Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototypes to meet recently identified critical capability gaps for anti-jam SATCOM.  The new terminal will augment the existing capability of the Secure, Mobile, Anti-jam, Reliable, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) AEHF terminal, with the intent to backfill decreasing SMART-T numbers due to obsolescence.  This ensures the Army's ability to meet increasing EW threat requirements.

FY 2021 funding was realigned to 0303142A - SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) / 456 -  MILSATCOM System Engineering to support Protected Anti-jam Tactical SATCOM development, engineering, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This project funds advanced systems engineering, research, development, test and evaluation of emerging protected Satellite Communications technologies to provide resilience and anti-jam protection against Electronic Warfare (EW).  The program will leverage contracts established by the Air Force for the development of Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modems, including development of a dual small form factor modem capable of running the PTW and Network Centric Waveform - Resilient (NCW-R), beginning in FY2020.  Production and Fielding of the PTW modems will begin in FY2023 under the Protected Anti-JAM Tactical SATCOM procurement line (B34002).

This project also funds the research, development and testing of an Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototype to aid in filling the identified critical gap in protected communications.  This terminal is a direct follow-on effort to the Secure, Mobile, Anti-jam, Resilient, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T).  The Program Office is working closely with the US Air Force on scheduling insertion of the terminal into the satellite Mission Planner as well as working with NSA to develop a timely path to certification.  The terminal research and development effort will be awarded in FY2020; a development test combined with robust Military utility user assessment will inform an FY2022 decision point on the path forward to the terminal.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT III program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 
JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM), constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is used as an institutional trainer though is available as a deployable asset.  JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. On 14 Jan 2016, the Army Acquisition Executive designated the JTAGS Pre-Planned Product Improvement (JTAGS P3I) program as a separate ACAT III modification program.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  P3I Improvements upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and improves warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 is complete. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite delivering critical capabilities sooner. Phase 2
Spiral 1 and Spiral 2 will be completed in FY 2020.

                                <r2:Description>JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. Spiral 1 delivers stereo SBIRS Geosynchronous staring sensor capabilities and SBIRS HEO Pseudo-Link 4 (P/L 4) data. Spiral 2 delivers Cobra Brass and emerging threats data and Missile Defense System Exerciser (MDSE) capabilities (FY 2018-2020). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-21).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible.</r2:Description>

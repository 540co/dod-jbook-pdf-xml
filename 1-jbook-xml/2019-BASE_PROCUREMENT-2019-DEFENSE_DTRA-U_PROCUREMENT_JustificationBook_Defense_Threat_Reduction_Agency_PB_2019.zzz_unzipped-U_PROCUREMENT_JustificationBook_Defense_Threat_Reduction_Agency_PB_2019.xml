            <proc:Description>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) continues to expand its support for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction mission overseas.  The FY 2019 budget supports DTRA vehicles located overseas which are purchased through U.S. embassies, and provides for a vehicle program that ensures uniform serviceability to all areas.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Funding for this budget line item provides for the procurement, maintenance, and lifecycle replacement of DTRA's non-tactical vehicles in support of missions in the United States and overseas.  These vehicles are operated in rocky and unpaved terrain resulting in shortened lifecycles and increased volume for maintenance.  Lifecycle requirements are based on GSA fleet management guidelines and vehicle maintenance.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Other Major Equipment Procurement Program provides for the modernization of DTRA core computing technologies, including information technology infrastructure upgrades to ensure interoperability and compliance with the Joint Information Environment Regional Security Stacks.  The investment allows for focused enhancement of the Agency-wide Cybersecurity, Computer Network Defense, Network Operations, and Security Center capabilities in compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 8500.01, "Cybersecurity," dated March 14, 2014, and the continuous monitoring capabilities mandated by DoD Instruction 8510.01, Change 2, "Risk Management Framework for DoD Information Technology (IT)," dated July, 28, 2017.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 funding of $6,437 thousand resourced the following initiatives:
     -  Information Technology (IT) infrastructure core routing and switching required to maintain basic connectivity integrity to ensure domain security and viability;
     -  DTRA Experimentation Lab/Reachback systems to conduct experimental computing;
     -  Analytical equipment for Chemical Biological Weapons of Mass Destruction (CBWMD) search missions;
     -  Lifecycle replacement of the primary Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services (DIAMONDS) enterprise server equipment located at DTRA, Fort Belvoir, Virginia; and
     -  Nuclear Arms Control Technology (NACT) program for International Monitoring System (IMS) recapitalization, component replenishment/replacement, and monitoring system acquisition to meet on-going operational responsibilities.

The FY 2018 budget of $12,363 thousand resources the following new and continuing efforts:
     -  One-time replacement of DTRA's classified network cable plant infrastructure that is obsolete.  The cable connectors, which were installed in DTRA facilities a decade ago, are no longer manufactured, supported, or available on the market, causing compatibility issues with new end-user devices as well as network switching and routing equipment;
     -  IT infrastructure core routing and switching, DTRA Experimentation Lab/Reachback systems, analytical equipment for CBWMD search missions, and the life-cycle replacement of DIAMONDS enterprise server equipment located at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico; and
     -  Continued support to the NACT program for IMS component replenishment and monitoring system acquisition necessary to meet on-going operational responsibilities.

The FY 2019 budget of $5,592 thousand will fund the following new and continuing efforts:
     -  Chemical Biological (CB) analytical equipment kits/hardware for the Computer Network Defense Tool, expanding DTRA's capability to execute cyber vulnerability scanning in support of Balanced Survivability Assessments (BSAs);
     -  Enterprise records management application, making DTRA compliant with Presidential OMB Directive M-12-18.  The directive is requesting federal agencies to manage all permanent electronic records in an electronic format by the year 2019;
     -  Information technology enhancements to the DTRA Experimentation Laboratory supporting Technical Reachback;
     -  IT Infrastructure; and 
     -  Continues support for the NACT program to meet on-going operational responsibilities through the recapitalization of U.S. IMS stations, ensuring the continued delivery of nuclear explosion monitoring data in support of U.S. and DoD objectives.

The decrease from FY 2018 to FY 2019 reflects completion of the one-time cable plant infrastructure lifecycle replacement bringing DTRA's cable plant up to current industry standards and revised acquisition strategy for cloud services.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This Line Item is a new procurement line item in the DTRA budget, but not a new effort. This effort supports the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and is part of the transfer of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund (JITDF, 2093) to regular defense-wide appropriations (0100, 0400, and 0300) per the Chairman's recommendation to the Senate Appropriations Committee for the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, 2018.

The countering improvised threats mission under the authority, direction, and control of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), enables the DoD to counter improvised explosive devices and emerging threats in support of Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and deployed Warfighters.

The overall mission is accomplished by:

     -  Sustaining an advanced information technology and fusion infrastructure that enables a threat awareness and understanding capability;
     -  Providing expeditionary, forward-deployed operations, intelligence, training, and advisory capabilities with reach-back support;
     -  Enabling rapid and innovative counter-improvised-threat solution development and delivery;
     -  Supporting Military Departments/Services' pre-deployment training and CCDRs' priority training-exercise support requirements as requested and validated; and
     -  Leveraging broad Communities of Action that include DoD, other U.S. Government departments and agencies, key coalition allies and partners, academia, and the private sector to leverage their capabilities, expertise, access, and authorities to counter threat-networks and their use and facilitation of improvised weapons.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY 2019 request supports contingency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by providing U.S. Joint Force Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) with an awareness and understanding of the threat, and the resources needed to support other contingencies including those with the mission to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Specifically, the FY 2019 Procurement, Defense-Wide (P, DW) Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget request supports measures to provide technologies to defeat improvised threats such as:  Advanced wireless signals and compatible electronic countermeasures for improvised explosive device (IED) defeat/neutralization; Miniaturized and integrated sensors; Hand held detectors; and the procuring of Information Technology capabilities. These resources support the Department of Defense's (DoD) goal to rapidly close the gap between the enemy's innovation cycles and the preparedness and operational capabilities of deploying and deployed U.S. Joint Forces by procuring mission critical support items rapidly.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>Funding enables DoD responses to improvised weapons.  DTRA-JIDO delivers counter-IED and improvised threat solutions in full collaboration with its partners.  Through a robust Communities of Action (CoA) approach, DTRA coordinates with the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), the Joint Staff, the Military Departments/Services, the interagency, coalition partners, industry, and academia to develop counter-IED and improvised threat solutions that further enable the maneuverability and force protection of deployed U.S. Joint Forces.  This methodology leverages the authorities, access, and capabilities of the entire U.S. Government and its partners to garner support for counter-IED and improvised threat development and delivery.</proc:Remarks>

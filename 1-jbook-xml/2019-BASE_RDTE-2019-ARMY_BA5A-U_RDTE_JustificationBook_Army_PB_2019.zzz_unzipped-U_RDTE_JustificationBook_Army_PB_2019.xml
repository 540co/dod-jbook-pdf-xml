            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget estimate request funds the development of Aircraft Avionics systems required to horizontally and vertically integrate the battlefield and the integration of those systems into Army aircraft. Tasks in this Program Element support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.

The Doppler Global Positioning System Navigation Set (DGNS) Upgrade program completes system engineering trade studies to reduce space, weight, and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as inertial sensor, MIL-STD-1553 interface card, and Instrument Flight Rules map display.  It also prepares Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to the existing DGNS ASN-128D Line Replaceable Units (LRU) as a result of those trade studies.  The DGNS upgrade continues with execution of Non-Recurring Engineering for Computer Display Unit (CDU) and Signal Data Converter LRU ECP packages.  The ASN-128D CDU upgrade replaces the current CDU faceplate with a touch screen display, provides a moving navigation map capability and optimizes pilot interface to augment existing Instrument Flight Rules capability promoting safer flight operations.  The CDU upgrade will support Assured-Position Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) operations in conjunction with additional system LRU upgrades, includes anti-jam antenna capabilities, and supports Department of Defense (DoD) and Army's requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations.  This will require assessment and follow-on upgrade to the DGNS navigation system.  The CDU upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance and associated PNT capability gaps, and will evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.

The Enhanced Aviation GATM Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) Navigation System (EAGLE) A-PNT integration program assesses current capabilities in identified operational PNT environment levels, tests identified upgrades to existing EGI hardware in order to accommodate A-PNT in identified operational environments, and incorporates M-Code.  It supports DoD and Army's requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations and requires assessment and follow-on upgrade to the EGI navigation system.  The EAGLE upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance, associated PNT capability gaps, integrate anti-jam antenna capabilities, and evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.

The Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Increment I program increases survivability due to DVE brownout conditions encountered during takeoff and landing. The DVE Increment I program is equally applicable to training scenarios as well as tactical operations. DVE Increment I will combine sensor(s) technology with critical aircraft flight information (aircraft state data) to provide an initial capability that increases aircrew awareness through detection and warning of hazardous terrain and obstacles. DVE Increment I improves safety, reduces risk, and maximizes flexibility for Aviation units. DVE Increment I activities include development, system testing, qualification, and aircraft integration. 

The DVE Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) is an Army Directed Requirement (DR) to provide DVE systems to 15 HH-60M Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters and 25 Special Operations aircraft. The DVE QRC DR fulfills an immediate DVE requirement while bridging the gap between future DVE capabilities pursued within the DVE Increment I program of record. The DVE QRC DR provides a forward looking, situational awareness, fused-sensor image for single aircraft takeoff and landing in brownout conditions.   

The Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army aviation automated information system program providing specific capabilities needed at the aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation operations, safety, and training to increase operational effectiveness and situational awareness at all command echelons.  ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement the DoD mandated Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. ADEC will standardize flight scheduling/management, risk management, mission approval, and flight data analysis and visualization. ADEC provides interfaces to Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS) to reduce data entry and the information technology footprint while enabling disconnected and split based operations.

The Improved Data Modem (IDM) provides digital connectivity among airborne and ground platforms and transmission of air-to-air target data between IDM equipped aircraft using existing radio and crypto equipment. IDM new software architecture will incorporate the ability to host IDM functionality on hardware that meets the minimum requirements to run the IDM Operating Flight Program. These efforts will include development and testing of that capability, as well as any documentation required to ensure Government Purpose rights to the new software.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This project is comprised of multiple systems supporting aircraft avionics. While the detailed acquisition strategy varies from program to program, the general strategy is for each individual program to complete the development and testing efforts in coordination with the aircraft platforms on integration issues, use the various contracts of the aircraft platforms original equipment manufacturers on integration efforts, and utilize the Aviation &amp; Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center for software development. This requires the use of various contract methods and types to accomplish the aircraft avionics development efforts. All required acquisition program documentation is prepared.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget request funds the Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Directed Requirement (DR) and the DVE Increment I program.  DVE QRC DR activity includes the development, system testing, qualification, integration, and installation of a DVE system on Army aircraft to support an operational test event.

The DVE Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) is an Army Directed Requirement (DR) to provide DVE systems to 15 HH-60M Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters and 25 Special Operations aircraft. The DVE QRC DR fulfills an immediate DVE requirement while bridging the gap between future DVE capabilities pursued within the DVE Increment I program of record. The DVE QRC DR provides a forward looking, situational awareness, fused-sensor image for single aircraft takeoff and landing in brownout conditions.   

The Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Increment I program increases survivability due to DVE brownout conditions encountered during takeoff and landing. The DVE Increment I program is equally applicable to training scenarios as well as tactical operations. DVE Increment I will combine sensor(s) technology with critical aircraft flight information (aircraft state data) to provide an initial capability that increases aircrew awareness through detection and warning of hazardous terrain and obstacles. DVE Increment I improves safety, reduces risk, and maximizes flexibility for Aviation units. DVE Increment I activities include development, system testing, qualification, and aircraft integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Funding for the Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) program has been moved to PE 0604201A, Aircraft Avionics/Project EW7, Degraded Visual Environment, beginning in FY18.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget estimate submission request funds the development of Networking and Mission Planning systems required to horizontally and vertically integrate the battlefield and the integration of those systems into Army aircraft. Tasks in this Program Element Support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.

The DVE Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) is an Army Directed Requirement (DR) to provide DVE systems to 15 HH-60M Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters and 25 Special Operations aircraft. The DVE QRC DR fulfills an immediate DVE requirement while bridging the gap between future DVE capabilities pursued within the DVE Increment I program of record. The DVE QRC DR provides a forward looking, situational awareness, fused-sensor image for single aircraft takeoff and landing in brownout conditions.   

The Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Increment I program increases survivability due to DVE brownout conditions encountered during takeoff and landing. The DVE Increment I program is equally applicable to training scenarios as well as tactical operations. DVE Increment I will combine sensor(s) technology with critical aircraft flight information (aircraft state data) to provide an initial capability that increases aircrew awareness through detection and warning of hazardous terrain and obstacles. DVE Increment I improves safety, reduces risk, and maximizes flexibility for Aviation units. DVE Increment I activities include development, system testing, qualification, and aircraft integration. 

The Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army aviation automated information system program providing specific capabilities needed at the aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation operations, safety, and training to increase operational effectiveness and situational awareness at all command echelons. ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement the DoD mandated Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. ADEC will standardize flight scheduling/management, risk management, mission approval, and flight data analysis and visualization. ADEC provides interfaces to Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS) to reduce data entry and the information technology footprint while enabling disconnected and split based operations.

The Improved Data Modem (IDM) provides digital connectivity among airborne and ground platforms and transmission of air-to-air target data between IDM equipped aircraft using existing radio and crypto equipment. IDM new software architecture will incorporate the ability to host IDM functionality on hardware that meets the minimum requirements to run the IDM Operating Flight Program. These efforts will include development and testing of that capability, as well as any documentation required to ensure Government Purpose rights to the new software.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This project is comprised of multiple systems supporting aircraft avionics. While the detailed acquisition strategy varies from program to program, the general strategy is for each individual program to complete the development and testing efforts in coordination with the aircraft platforms on integration issues, use the various contracts of the aircraft platforms original equipment manufacturers on integration efforts, and utilize the Aviation &amp; Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center for software development. The DVE QRC DR acquisition strategy is to leverage an existing contract competitively awarded by the Technology Applications Program Office.  An Other Government Agency will perform the installation of the DVE QRC DR system into the designated aircraft. A disposition analysis of the DVE QRC DR will inform the DVE Increment I acquisition strategy. The DVE Increment I acquisition strategy is to leverage the DVE QRC DR materiel solution for installation onto additional aircraft.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for tactical Electronic Warfare (EW). The Integrated Electronic Warfare System (IEWS) is a capability set that integrates electronic attack, protect and support functions to dramatically improve the ability to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage within the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS).  It is based on a modular, scalable and open architecture to allow Army Brigade Combat Team (BCT) and Joint Force Commander's to tailor capability responses against a variety of EW threats/scenarios. 

The IEWS capability set is structured along four program lines of effort: 1) Project DX5 Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tools (EWPMT), 2) Project DX6 Multi-Function EW (MFEW), 3) Project VS6 Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) which provides current defensive electronic attack capability, and 4) Project ET7 Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation (RIM) which resolves radio frequency interference and electromagnetic fratricide and enables electronic warfare and communications compatibility.

Project DX5 - EWPMT will provide the Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) planning capabilities to coordinate, manage, and deconflict the use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum and synchronize spectrum operations within the Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) cell. EWPMT will integrate data elements from Mission Command, Intelligence, and Fires to achieve a Common Operating Picture (COP) of the Electromagnetic Operational Environment. 

Project DX6 - The Multi-Function EW (MFEW) is a capability set that will provide the BCT Commander with an organic Electronic Attack (EA) and Electronic Warfare Support (ES) capability. MFEW variants empower Commanders to shape the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) to their advantage.  MFEW will provide commanders from BCT to CORPS with an organic EW capability that dramatically improves a land force's ability to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage within the EMS in order to execute successful unified land operations. These capabilities give the commander a competitive advantage by denying, degrading the enemy's ability to conduct Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and targeting; and allows the commander to optimize effects within the EMS at the time and place of their choosing. These systems are networked with a C2 system that enables remote operation and dynamic tasking/reprogramming. 

Project ET7 - Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation (RIM) is a cross cutting capability to centrally manage and provide oversight to identify, define, test, and coordinate development of Radio Frequency (RF) interference mitigation material solutions to resolve mutual RF interference and electromagnetic fratricide for Spectrum Dependent Systems (SDS).

Project VS6 - Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) provides for protection for ground forces operating in vehicle convoys, single vehicle operations and fixed locations in all theatres of operations.  It is programmable to migrate with the evolving threat and provides non-lethal capabilities which enable freedom of movement across depth/breadth of the operational environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multi-Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) is a capability set that will provide the BCT Commander with an organic offensive Electronic Attack (EA) and Electronic Warfare Support (ES) capability. MFEW variants empower Commanders to shape the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) to their advantage. MFEW will provide commanders with an organic EW capability that dramatically improves a land force's ability to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage within the EMS in order to execute successful unified land operations. These capabilities give the commander a competitive advantage by denying, degrading the enemy's ability to conduct Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and targeting, and allows the commander to optimize effects within the EMS at the time and place of their choosing. These systems are networked with a C2 system to enable remote operation and dynamic tasking/reprogramming. 

MFEW-Air is an airborne payload to be mounted on both manned and unmanned aerial platforms. MFEW-Air is comprised of three variants: Air Large (Class IV Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), Air Small (Class III Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), and manned rotary wing payloads.  MFEW-Air will retain the capability to operate independently or integrated with EW systems providing a layered EW approach. This will provide the Commander the ability to detect, identify (ID), locate and place effects on emitters.

Justification:
FY 2019 Base dollars in the amount of $44.611 million will support MFEW development activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation (RIM) is a cross cutting capability to centrally manage and provide oversight to identify, define, test, and coordinate development of Radio Frequency (RF) interference mitigation material solutions to resolve mutual RF interference and electromagnetic fratricide for Spectrum Dependent Systems (SDS).
 
Centralized management of RIM offers a holistic approach for identification, system of systems engineering, developmental testing, and maturing of RIM solutions to address current and evolving RF interference issues.  User and acquisition communities will synchronize, integrate, and codify RIM requirements to facilitate the cross cutting approach necessary for the efficient procurement of common RIM products. This approach will eliminate the need for separate hardware and platform integration research and development efforts for SDS and platforms. An integrated approach will eliminate the need for separate hardware and platform integration research and development efforts for SDS and platform Program Managers. RIM products are intended to preserve the investment that the Army has made in current Electronic Warfare (EW) and Mission Command Transport SDS and provide a strategy for future efforts for new SDS development with integrated RIM solutions. 

Justification:
FY 2019 Base funds in the amount of $6.247 million will provide engineering support activities to continue the development of Interference Cancellation (IC) Light technology and develop the IC Algorithm technology to mitigate interference between Force Protection and Communication systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Radio Frequency (RF) Interference Mitigation (RIM) will follow a System of Systems, enterprise strategy to develop and test hardware solutions such as tunable filters, Interference Cancellers (IC) to address RF interference on Army platforms. Designated platforms will procure, integrate and test RIM solutions with their association spectrum dependent systems.  

The RIM acquisition strategy shifted focus from tunable filter technology to IC technology. The decision to shift focus from tunable filters to IC technology was a direct result of the S&amp;T community accelerating the technical maturity. IC technology will enhance the warfighters ability to utilize the spectrum compared to tunable filter technology.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radio (MNVR) enables the extension of data services within the tactical network through seamless integration of the upper and lower tiers; providing software-defined, multi-channel networking radios for a wide variety of Army tactical vehicles to meet the Army's requirement for the Mid-tier Wideband Networking (MWN) capability. The MNVR provides self-forming and self-healing communication networks from the brigade to the platoon level throughout the full range of military operations.

The MNVR, a modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI), supports Army Mission Command operational requirements with a multi-channel, Type 1 (supporting multiple independent levels of security), vehicular mounted radio hosting networking waveforms.  The MNVR narrows the data capability gap at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) company level and provides the capability to build a data extension to the lowest echelons, and then enables the extension of services from the Forward Operating Base (FOB) to the platform. MNVR provides a dynamic, scalable, On-the-Move (OTM) network architecture, connecting the Soldier to the Mission Command (MC) Network and enhances capability to exchange voice and data simultaneously and faster than current systems. The advanced network waveforms provide rapid distribution of data and imagery with increased information assurance protection and automatic routing across complex terrain.  The system operates Internet Protocol (IP) based networking waveforms offering increased data throughput through self-forming, self-healing, managed communication networks.  Its route and retransmit functionality links waveforms in different frequency bands, within the 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) range, to form one cohesive network.  MNVR nomenclature has been designated as AN/VRC-118(V)1.
 
A single award contract was awarded on 24 September 2013, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), firm fixed price, 3-year ordering period.  Production of 232 radios for Test &amp; Evaluation and certification purposes was completed in 3QFY 2014. On 3 Oct 2016, Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) published a MNVR MS C Acquisition Decision Memorandum.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radio (MNVR) enables the extension of data services within the tactical network through seamless integration of the upper and lower tiers; providing software-defined, multi-channel networking radios for a wide variety of Army tactical vehicles to meet the Army's requirement for the Mid-tier Wideband Networking (MWN) capability. The MNVR provides self-forming and self-healing communication networks from the brigade to the platoon level throughout the full range of military operations.

The MNVR, a modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI), supports Army Mission Command operational requirements with a multi-channel, Type 1 (supporting multiple independent levels of security), vehicular mounted radio hosting networking waveforms.  The MNVR narrows the data capability gap at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) company level and provides the capability to build a data extension to the lowest echelons, and then enables the extension of services from the Forward Operating Base (FOB) to the platform. MNVR provides a dynamic, scalable, On-the-Move (OTM) network architecture, connecting the Soldier to the Mission Command (MC) Network and enhances capability to exchange voice and data simultaneously and faster than current systems. The advanced network waveforms provide rapid distribution of data and imagery with increased information assurance protection and automatic routing across complex terrain.  The system operates Internet Protocol (IP) based networking waveforms offering increased data throughput through self-forming, self-healing, managed communication networks.  Its route and retransmit functionality links waveforms in different frequency bands, within the 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) range, to form one cohesive network.  MNVR nomenclature has been designated as AN/VRC-118(V)1.

A single award contract was awarded on 24 September 2013, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), firm fixed price, 3-year ordering period.  Production of 232 radios for Test &amp; Evaluation and certification purposes was completed in 3QFY 2014. On 3 Oct 2016, Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) published a MNVR MS C Acquisition Decision Memorandum.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MNVR is a modified NDI industry solution for a multi-channel vehicular radio hosting networking waveforms. This modified NDI approach takes advantage of competitively priced, mature and producible technology that meets technical specifications.
 
An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed on 20 September 2013 by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), approving a Materiel Development Decision (MDD). The ADM designated MNVR as an ACAT 1D Special Interest Program under the continued oversight of the DAE.  The ADM also approved the award of a competitive contract, and authorized the procurement of up to 232 modified NDI radios for Test &amp; Evaluation, Platform Integration and Certification purposes in order to inform a MS C decision. On 3 Oct 2016, Defense Acquisition Executive (ADM) published a MNVR MS C Acquisition Decision Memorandum. In Nov 2017, the DAE rescinded the Special Interest designation, as well as the ACAT ID designation. The Army will determine the ACAT designation and MDA at a later date.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The All Source Analysis System (ASAS) provided US Army commanders at all echelons from battalion to Army Service Component Command (ASCC) with automated support to the management and planning, processing and analysis, and dissemination of intelligence, counterintelligence, and electronic warfare. ASAS provided the means to enhance the commander's timely and comprehensive understanding of enemy deployments, capabilities, and potential courses of action. The system used standard joint and Army protocols and message formats to interface with selected National, joint, theater, and tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and preprocessors and Army, joint, and coalition battle command systems. The ASAS Family of Systems migrated into the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program and the Army is using it as the initial platform to provide accelerated DCGS-A capabilities to the force. 

The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS) is the Army's CI and HUMINT tactical collection and reporting system.  CHARCS provides automation support for information collection, reporting, investigations, source &amp; interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps Analysis and Control Element (ACE).  CHARCS reports digital data such as maps, overlays, images, video, biometrics, scanned documents and audio files.  These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the DCGS-A for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products.  Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems.  The first is the AN/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT) which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents.  The second is the AN/PYQ-3 CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS) which provides the team leader tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers, scanners, cameras and audio recorders to assist the collection mission.  Each CHATS has an associated Mission Support Peripheral Sets and Kits (MS-PSK) or Collection Peripheral Sets and Kits (C-PSK). 

The Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS) develops, fields, and sustains a basic automated foreign speech and text translation capability for Army tactical systems to augment and compliment limited human linguistic resources. These integrated automated translation capabilities will be applicable across three different system configurations; a hand-held/wearable portable device, a laptop/mobile device, and in a networked/web-enabled system. The software modules will translate English from a prioritized list of languages in a prioritized collection of domains (e.g. medical, intelligence, base security). MFLTS is interoperable with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) automation equipment to include the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) and Nett Warrior, and will be interoperable with a future version of the CI/HUMINT Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Each CHATS has an associated Mission Support Peripheral Sets and Kits (MS-PSK) or Collection Peripheral Sets and Kits (C-PSK).  Phasing in of the Mobile Hand Held (M H/H), to displace the C-PSK, will begin in FY 2018.

The C-PSK provides specialized collection component capabilities to support CI/HUMINT collection missions. C-PSK capabilities are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies and include video and camera equipment, global positioning system (GPS), voice recording device and infrared strobe lights.  Phasing in of the Mobile Hand Held, to displace the C-PSK, will begin in FY 2018.  The MS-PSK provides specialized collection component capabilities to support CI/HUMINT collection missions at the OMT.  MS-PSK capabilities are COTS technologies and include night vision photography &amp; video, captured materiel tracking, Credibility Assessment Capability, Digital Media Forensics software, and Document Exploitation software.

FY 2018 Base amount of $3.274 million will fund efforts for the development of a single CI/HUMINT software baseline in coordination with DCGS-A, software testing, software support to the Mobile Handheld (M H/H), and system engineering management support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS) develops, fields, and sustains a basic automated foreign speech and text translation capability for Army tactical systems to augment and compliment limited human linguistic resources. These integrated automated translation capabilities will be applicable across three different system configurations; a hand-held/wearable portable device, a laptop/mobile device, and in a networked/web-enabled system. The software modules will translate English from a prioritized list of languages in a prioritized collection of domains (e.g. medical, intelligence, base security). MFLTS is interoperable with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) automation equipment to include the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) and Nett Warrior, and will be interoperable with a future version of the CI/HUMINT Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS).

FY18 base dollars in the amount of $1.500 million provides for the program office support to the development and collection of prioritized Speech to Speech (S2S) and Text to Text (T2T) languages and domains.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MFLTS Technology Development (TD) Phase developed an open software architecture prototype using full and open competition that allowed the addition, upgrade and replacement of translation system components for integration into existing Programs. During the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the program integrated technology demonstrated during the TD Phase to meet Key Performance Parameters (KPPs).  This included the requirement to meet an Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) level of 1 for two speech translation modules and an ILR level of 1+ for one text translation module in hand-held/wearable portable, laptop/mobile, and networked/web-enabled system configurations.  Milestone B was achieved 22 Jul 13 and an option period for the EMD phase contract was awarded 22 Jul 13.  Following the Limited Deployment Decision (LDD), a contract was awarded to integrate and field MFLTS capability drop #1 in FY16.  A full and open competition will result in the award of a contract(s) in FY18 for the incremental development of new MFLTS SW Capability Drops.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget request funds Infantry Support Weapons.  This Program Element (PE) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) manages the Soldier as a system, with the goal of increasing Soldiers' combat effectiveness, increasing survivability, and improving the Soldiers' quality of life.  It develops and tests prototypes of weapons, clothing, equipment, and other items useful to support the Soldier.  

Project ES9 (Advanced Tactical Parachute System) supports efforts to improve Static Line (SL) and Military Free Fall (MFF) personnel parachutes and associated equipment to include canopy improvements based on integration of new technology with the goal of enhancing the insertion capability of the airborne soldier and increasing the performance, safety and durability of personnel airdrop equipment.

Project EW4 (Crew Served Weapons Engineering) supports efforts to transition components or prototypes from Small Arms Improvement, Project S54, Program Element 0603827A, (Budget Activity 4) and other domestic and foreign sources of small arms weapons to demonstrate, test and evaluate capability near or at planned operational requirements.

Project FF2 (Small Arms Fire Control (SAFC)) supports optimized fire control devices to support Squad (S), Crew Served (CS) and Precision (P).  SAFC shall increase the probability of hit and decrease time to engage across a range of small arms weapon systems, with a direct-view optic that allows for quicker and more accurate target detection and recognition.  

Project FI2 (Lightweight 30mm Cannon) provides increased lethality modification to the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), it serves as the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) light reconnaissance vehicle, an upgraded medium caliber weapon will be developed, tested and evaluated for integration into a modified remote weapon station.

Project S58 (Soldier Enhancement Program) supports accelerated integration, modernization, and enhancement efforts of lighter, more lethal weapons, and improved Soldier items including lighter, more comfortable load-bearing equipment, field gear, survivability items, communications equipment, and navigational aids. 

Project S60 (Clothing and Equipment) supports pre-production development of state-of-the-art individual clothing and equipment to improve the survivability, mobility and sustainment affecting the quality of life of the individual Soldier.

Project S61 (Aircrew Integrated Systems) provides System Development programs with improved aviator safety, survivability, and human performance that amplify the warfighting effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of the Army aircraft including the AH-64 Apache/Longbow, CH-47 Chinook, UH/HH-60 Blackhawk, Light Utility Helicopter, and Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter.

Project S62 (Counter-Defilade Target Engagement) the XM25, Individual Airburst Weapon System (IAWS) delivers a 25mm programmable high explosive airburst (HEAB) round to defeat defilade and point area targets out to approximately 600 meters. Accurate and lethal engagement of defilade targets at the squad level is the number one capability gap identified by the United States Army Infantry Center (USAIC).

Project S63 (Small Arms Improvements) demonstrates engineering development models or integrated commercial items designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition, fire control, training effectiveness, and reliability for small arms weapon systems and ammunition.  Programs include Improved Weapons Coatings, Personal Defense Weapon, 30 Round 5.56mm Magazine, Modular Handgun System (MHS), Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR), Sub Compact, and Interim Combat Service Rifle (ICR). 

Project S64 (CROWS) continues enhancing CROWS capability and reliability to increase its application across combat and tactical platforms.  This capability enhances the Soldier's survivability, lethality and situational awareness.

Project S70 (Personnel Recovery Support System) provides system research, development and testing of the Personal Recovery Support System/Personnel Recovery Support Equipment supporting operations to report and locate isolated, missing, detained or captured Soldiers.

Project VS5 (Soldier Protective Equipment) supports engineering and manufacturing development of Individual Soldier Ballistic Protection equipment.  It will leverage advancements in technology to continue incremental improvements to body armor (to include improved outer tactical vests, plate carriers, and helmets) and other personal protective equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Crew Served Weapons Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program provides funds to transition components or prototypes from Small Arms Improvement, Project S54, Program Element 0603827A, (Budget Activity 4) and other domestic and foreign sources of small arms weapons to demonstrate, test and evaluate capability near or at planned operational requirements.  Crew Served Weapons systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on system improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition, fire control, usability, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include system development, integration (to include human-systems), demonstration, test and evaluate components, prototypes and operational system prototypes of small arms weapons and/or enhancements.  Benefits include continuous improvements to small arms weapons, fire control equipment, optics, gun barrels, ancillary equipment, training devices, component mounts, weapon mounts, and weapon/ammunition interface of current small arms fleet or new weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Small Arms Fire Control (SAFC) is a requirement for optimized fire control devices with improved Size Weight and Power (SWAP) to support Squad (S), Crew Served (CS) and Precision (P).  SAFC shall increase the probability of hit and decrease time to engage across a range of small arms weapon systems, with a direct-view optic that allows for quicker and more accurate target detection and recognition.  The SAFC shall utilize an open system of systems architecture comprised of modular components, to deliver to current ground forces the initial increased core capability followed by increasing increments of capability/enhancements over time as technology matures and evolves.  Small Arms Fire Control will culminate in multiple configurations: a Small Arms Fire Control - Squad (SAFC-S), Small Arms Fire Control - Crew Served (SAFC-CS), and Small Arms Fire Control - Precision (SAFC-P).  They may include technology such as variable magnification direct view (day) optics, atmospheric sensors, an overlaid digital display, weapon orientation sensor, range determination, ballistic computer, disturbed reticle, and networked lethality.  There are also other associated fire control efforts being worked simultaneously to include Advanced Individual Handheld Binocular (AIHB), Advanced Fire Control with Precision Projectile Tracking, Next Generation Fire Control, and Small Arms Fire Control for 40mm Low Velocity.

FY2019 RDT&amp;E funding in the amount of $20.201 million will continue the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phases for the two (2) Fire Control configurations ( SAFC-CS and SAFC-P) and will support integration, manufacture, and testing of Next Generation Fire Control technologies.  FY2019 funding will be focused on bid sample contract awards, down selection, design/prototyping, developmental and initial operational testing and evaluation.  Other associated fire control efforts being worked simultaneously include, Advanced Individual Handheld Binocular (AIHB), Advanced Fire Control with Precision Projectile Tracking, and Small Arms Fire Control for 40mm Low Velocity.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In support of an Army directed requirement (reference DAPR-ZA Memorandum, dated 5 July 2016) to provide an increased lethality modification to the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), to serve as the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) light reconnaissance vehicle, an upgraded medium caliber weapon will be developed, tested and evaluated for integration into a modified remote weapon station.

The XM914 is an upgraded and modified version of the M230 cannon currently equipped on the AH-64 Apache advanced attack helicopter.  The XM914 is a link fed, externally powered and electrically primed 30mm chain gun, capable of firing two hundred rounds per minute.  The gun incorporates an anti-hangfire system and an extended barrel for enhanced muzzle velocity.  The XM914 provides significant lethality improvements over the current M2 .50 caliber machine gun and MK19 grenade machine gun and provides the capability required for Soldiers in a combat environment to engage enemy personnel and light armored targets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The XM914 is currently considered a non-standard weapon that is being sold commercially to foreign customers by the vendor. As a modified version of the M230 30mm chain gun for the AH-64 Apache advanced attack helicopter, the XM914 requires safety confirmation/safety release and weapon qualification for vehicle mounted platforms. In order to meet the Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) requirement of nine (9) systems by FY19 (and the remaining 243 systems to follow), a sole source contract based on urgency will be pursued for a period of performance of one (1) year. A long term Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract will be pursued for the year to follow.

The program supports new and emerging urgent requirements for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Directed Requirement and will support integration with the Remote Weapon Station on the vehicle or other platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Description: The Soldier Enhancement Program (SEP) was established in the Fiscal Year 1990 National Defense Authorization Act. SEP provides an innovative approach that includes procurement and evaluation of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)/Non Developmental Item (NDI)/Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) items that have the potential to enhance an Army Infantryman and Soldiers' ability to execute their combat mission. SEP provides significant savings and acceleration in the evaluation of items. The SEP program is managed jointly by Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier and the U.S. Army  Training and Doctrine Command-Maneuver Center of Excellence. SEP suggestions are submitted by individual Soldiers, Field Commanders, commercial manufacturers, and others via the PEO Soldier SEP website. Viable suggestions are vetted by a Council of Colonels (CoC) and validated as SEP initiatives by Department of the Army, Deputy Chief of Staff, G8, Force Development.  A limited number of validated SEP initiatives are procured and evaluated for feasibility and suitability. Based on the evaluation findings, the SEP CoC provides one or more of the following courses of action: (1) no further action required, (2) item did not meet objectives, (3) inform deliberate or urgent/emerging requirements generation, (4) initiate a new Program of Record (POR), (5) improve an existing POR, (6) transition to the Rapid Equipping Force or (7) add to the Rapid Fielding Initiative list.

Justification: FY19 RDT&amp;E funding supports SEP evaluations and documentation of results.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for the Air Soldier System (Air SS). The Air SS is Army aircrew survival and mission equipment that improves safety, survivability, and human performance. The Air SS Capability Development Document (CDD) addresses capability gaps identified during sustained combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including inadequate crew station compatibility caused by equipment bulk, aircraft mishaps as a result of limited Situational Awareness (SA), and lack of functionally integrated aircrew mission and survival equipment. Air SS delivers reduced bulk and weight of survival equipment; improved crew station compatibility; and improved pilot SA and safety.  The Air SS provides enhanced terrain, threat, and obstacle avoidance information; improved heads-up display (HUD) technologies that increase the aviator's SA; the capability to perform extended missions in extreme environmental and chemical/biological threat conditions; the capability to digitally replace paper-based DoD Flight Information Publications (Electronic Flight Bag); and develops and tests a modernized replacement for the Air Warrior survival vest that integrates with Soldier Protection System body armor (Aircrew Combat Ensemble). This project also funds the development and test of deferred CDD capabilities including improved laser eye protection and tactile cueing that enhances aviator SA. This program does not duplicate any aircraft platform program efforts.  Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Air SS P3I phase includes the development and qualification of the EFB, a digital Army aviation replacement for paper-based DoD Flight Information Publications, and the Aircrew Combat Ensemble (ACE), a replacement for the current Air Warrior survival vest that will further reduce weight and bulk, accommodate migration to the Army's new Soldier Protection System (SPS) modular ballistic protection system, and enhance compatibility and stowage/interface provisions for current and future clothing and individual survival equipment.  P3I efforts also continue to develop deferred capabilities as defined within the Capability Development Document (CDD) to include tactile Situational Awareness enhancements and enhanced laser eye protection. Contracts with industry include both Cost and Firm Fixed Price using full and open competition, each evaluated and selected to appropriately share risk between industry and the government.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE), FT Benning, GA (User Community) identifies the Counter Defilade Target Engagement (CDTE) as a critical capability gap for our Soldiers in combat. A Next Generation Counter Defilade Weapon to mitigate the critical capability gap (defeating defilade (hidden) targets from 35-500m) is required. The Next Generation Counter Defilade Weapon will provide the Infantry Soldier with a leap-ahead overmatch capability that allows the Soldier to engage defilade targets with a high degree of accuracy while posing minimal burden, in terms of weight and size. The system will integrate a weapon, ammunition, and a target acquisition/fire control subsystem that integrates thermal capability with direct-view optics, laser rangefinder, environmental sensors, ballistic computer, and internal display.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Individual Weapons Engineering Development program provides funds to transition components or prototypes from Small Arms Improvement, Project S54, Program Element 0603827A, (Budget Activity 4) and other domestic and foreign sources of small arms weapons to demonstrate, test and evaluate capability near or at planned operational requirements.  Small arms systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on system improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition, fire control, usability, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include system development, integration (to include human-systems), demonstration, test and evaluate components, prototypes and operational system prototypes of small arms weapons and/or enhancements.  Benefits include continuous improvements to small arms weapons, fire control equipment, optics, gun barrels, ancillary equipment, training devices, component mounts, weapon mounts, and weapon/ammunition interface of current small arms fleet or new weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The ICSR will be a lightweight derivative of a 7.62mm caliber rifle for selected Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) pending development, procurement and fielding of a new Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle (NGSAR).  BCTs require the capability to engage threat personnel with aimed lethal and accurate fires at ranges exceeding the current 5.56mm Carbine provided today. Threats are now typically engaging US Forces at ranges between 300m - 600m.  US Forces require this interim capability to regain parity and limited overmatch while the longer term overmatch capability is under development.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In support of an Army directed requirement (reference DAPR-ZA Memorandum, date 5 July 2016) to provide an increased lethality modification to the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), to serve as the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) light reconnaissance vehicle, an upgraded remote weapon station will be developed that integrates a medium-caliber weapon system.  Development will also begin on integration of additional effectors, including an improved and modified remotely operated weapon station for system and component level development, to include mechanical and software integration of Stinger surface-to-air missile.

The Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE) at FT Leonard Wood, Missouri (user community) has identified continued development of the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) as a critical improvement for the Soldier in a combat environment. By addressing the capability gap of non-turreted, lightly armored vehicles where the gunner is exposed to enemy fire, the current CROWS system provides the ability to rapidly and accurately locate and engage the enemy while allowing platform gunners to remain under armor, thereby providing greater protection and increasing overall lethality. 

Next generation requirements for the CROWS are identified in the CROWS Increment II Capability Development Document (CDD).   CROWS Increment II capability improvements will bolster overall situational awareness, survivability and lethality. Increment II requirements include improved sensor systems for enhanced identification ranges; wider fields of view; improved on-the-move accuracy; training capability; battlefield obscurants; mission data recording for After Action Reviews (AAR); increased lethality using legacy and future anti-personnel and anti-materiel precision scalable lethal and non-lethal weapon systems; improved ballistics protection; adaptability to integrate on a variety of legacy and future platforms including ground vehicles, watercraft, semi-autonomous and autonomous platforms; precision targeting including visible and infrared (IR) pointers; target hand-off; slew-to-cue; escalation of force (EOF) capabilities; and other additional system modifications and improvements.

Obsolescence and Increment II requirements will address recommendations identified in the Operational Test Agency Milestone Assessment Report (OMAR) and user community feedback. These modifications include, but are not limited to: improved optics survivability; auto-zoom; improved auto-tracking; improved sensors for increased situational awareness; and improved rounds counter. Additionally, development efforts will include system and component level reliability improvements that will extend system life and reduce overall CROWS logistics footprint.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The modified medium-caliber remote weapon station that will begin development in FY2018 shall use an incremental acquisition approach in its strategy.  The first increment will be part of an Urgent Materiel Release and will modify the legacy M153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) in order to integrate the XM914 30mm autocannon.  The second increment will require further design and development changes, upgrade the optics on the remote weapon station in order to increase the target identification range of the station to match the capability of the weapon, and incorporate a coaxial machine gun as a secondary weapon system.

The integration of additional effectors, such as the Stinger surface-to-air missile system, will leverage prior efforts to integrate the Javelin missile on the remote weapon station.

The legacy Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) used a single-step acquisition approach in its strategy. The CROWS achieved Type Classification Standard in 3QFY2011, Full Materiel Release in 3QFY2012 and Full Rate Production in 4QFY2012, in accordance with the Capability Production Document (CPD) Increment I, as clarified in June 2009. Capability Development Document Increment II was approved in October 2015 addressing requirements for the next generation of CROWS.

The program objective is to continue developing, improving and fielding the current generation (Increment I) and next generation (Increment II) of CROWS on various platforms in accordance with the Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP). The program supports new and emerging urgent requirements like the integration of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles, ground combat systems, Joint Lightweight Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) and fixed site mounting systems to support Integrated Base Defense (IBD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) fills 2 1/2-ton Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) and 5-ton Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV) truck requirements and associated companion trailers. FMTV trucks perform over 55 percent of the Army's local haul, line haul, and unit resupply missions.  It operates throughout theater as multi-purpose transportation vehicles in combat, combat support, and combat service support units.

The ASV is an all-wheel drive armored vehicle that provides ballistic protection, overhead protection, and protection against landmines. It is used by the Military Police to perform missions of area security, maneuver, and mobility support. 

Funding from this Program Element will be used to support the continued evolution of the future FMTV fleet as well as tech insertion opportunities to keep the current FMTV fleet relevant on today's battlefield.  This includes upgrades in survivability and crew protection, improved safety by leveraging advancements in commercial active safety technologies, modernizing the aging Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) fleet of vehicles, improved utilization through modularity, integration of advanced high efficiency powertrains and fuel saving technologies, and insertion of autonomous vehicle capabilities that will change the way transportation missions are conducted around the world.

FY 2019 Project H07 Base funds in the amount of $3.704 million will be used to conduct Live Fire Testing of the FMTVA2 truck and the FMTVA1P2 Underbody Armor Kit, as well as design and build an FMTV LVAD technical demonstrator.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) A2 production and Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) modernization effort restores vehicle performance that was lost due to the addition of armor protection kits as the threat to tactical vehicles and the FMTV has increased.  The FMTVA2 also addresses Space, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) constraints from having to host an increasing amount of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Counter-Incendiary Explosive Device (IED) equipment.  Program Management Office (PMO) Medium Tactical Vehicles (MTV) is executing the FMTVA2 effort documented in a signed Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on 16 November 2015. FY 2019 Project H07 Base funds in the amount of $1.000 million will be used to conduct Live Fire Testing of the FMTVA2.

The FMTVA1P2 represents the FMTV model currently in production with over 38,000 vehicles fielded to date.  The FMTVA1P2 will remain in the tactical vehicle fleet until 2040 and beyond.  To keep the A1P2 fleet viable into the future and able to perform its mission in austere environments, upgrades to Survivability and Crew Protection Kits will be required as the threat on the battlefield evolves. FY 2019 Project H07 Base funds in the amount of $.200 million will be used for Live Fire Testing of the improvements to the FMTV Underbody Armor Kits that are required to support Full Material Release.

The three FMTV Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) models (M1081, M1093, and M1094) ended production in 2009 and represent the oldest vehicles in the FMTV fleet.  Updates to the LVAD are needed to address obsolescence issues and bring the configuration up to current standards.  FY 2019 Project H07 Base funds in the amount of $2.504 million will be used to design and build an FMTV LVAD technical demonstrator.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Javelin is a man-portable, fire-and-forget, medium-range missile with enhanced situational awareness and precision direct-fire effects to defeat armored vehicles, fortifications, and soft targets in a range of military operations. Javelin uses a modular design to allow the system to evolve to meet changing threats and requirements via both software and hardware upgrades. The system consists of a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a built-in-test (BIT), and a modular missile encased in a disposable launch tube assembly. The system also includes training devices for tactical training and classroom training

FY 2019 Base dollars in the amount of $10.623 million will continue development engineering of the Javelin Lightweight Command Launch Unit (CLU).  Objective of the Javelin Lightweight CLU is a 50% reduction in weight and a 35% reduction in size compared to the Block I CLU, while meeting detect, recognize, and identify requirements.  Javelin Lightweight CLU is a result of user feedback on weight and bulk, and addresses the Close Combat Missile System - Medium Capability Production Document objective system weight requirement.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) aligns system development and demonstration of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (HTV) with Future Force requirements to support combat and combat support missions. Missions include the following: line haul, local haul, and unit resupply. HTV trucks transport water, ammunition, and general cargo over all terrain and throughout the battle-space. Systems include the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Palletized Load System (PLS), Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS), Line Haul, Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) as well as Recovery Systems that rescue large wheeled vehicle platforms in severe off-road conditions such as the Modular Catastrophic Recovery System (MCRS). Funding will also be used for developing the Army's next generation of tactical trucks, as part of the Army's Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Modernization Strategy. This Program Element (PE) supports the Family of Heavy Trucks to include, enablers, active safety technologies, and heavy tactical trailer development. Periodic evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection as described in the Long Term Protection Strategy (LTPS) is also supported by this PE for both the HTV family of vehicles and the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV).  The Army plans to procure a replacement for the DODX 40000 series tank hauling rail car.  The existing fleet will begin mandatory retirement starting in 2031.  In order to maintain the current capability of hauling two tanks per rail car and the increased weight of the tank, the Army will be developing a new 150+ ton articulated rail car that is supported by this PE.

FY 2019 Project 659 Base funds in the amount of $1.979 million are for the research and development of a solution to modify the HETS M1070A1 tractor and increase capability to an 85 Ton payload. Funding will also be used for Systems Engineering/Program Management (SEPM) for the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) to develop contracting documentation, System Engineering Plans (SEP) and Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMP). SEPM includes PM and System Engineering oversight required to manage the program and provide contractor oversight. Salaries, Benefits, Travel, Personnel Training and other Government costs are included for retaining a professional acquisition workforce.

FY 2019 Project E50 Base funds in the amount of $5.293 million will be used to build Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) Armor Capable Truck Asset Prototypes and Armor Solution testing. Armor Solution testing costs include system testing, evaluation and document production for the HDT program. Funding will also be used for the research and development of a solution to modify the HETS M1070A1 tractor and increase capability to an 85 Ton payload.

FY 2019 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $4.678 million will be used to build Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) Armor Capable Truck Asset Prototypes and Armor Solution testing. Armor Solution testing costs include system testing, evaluation, and document production for the HDT program.  Funding will also be used for the Objective Gunner Protection Kit / Common Remotely Operated  Weapon Station (OGPK/CROWS) upgrades on Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck A4 (HEMTTA4) and Palletized Load System A1 (PLSA1) Suspensions.  Live Fire Testing (LFT) will also be conducted on the improvements to the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) Underbody Armor Kits that are required to support Full Material Release.

The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $17.983 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) is comprised of a M1070A1 Tractor and M1000 Trailer for transport, recovery and evacuation of heavy, oversized combat equipment such as the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank and M88 or similar loads.  The current HETS has two capability gaps; Payload and Road Network Accessibility.  The HETS is not capable of transporting or loading/unloading the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT since it exceeds the HETS rated payload of 70 tons (U.S.).  Road Network Accessibility of the current HETS is restricted due to exceeding axle load limits CONUS/OCONUS, which prevents the HETS from obtaining road permits.  Short term is an interim solution to modify current HETS tractors and build new HETS trailers and the long term solution is the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) that will address these capability gaps in the future.  

The current interim solution is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) for Heavy Equipment Transporter Systems with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.

The Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) is a force protected tractor and trailer to operationally move and load/unload the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT.  EHETS will be capable of transporting at a higher rated payload and will self-load/unload heavy and outsized equipment such as the Abrams SEPv2 and SEPv3, which currently exceeds the existing Heavy Equipment Transporter System rated capacity of 70-tons (U.S.), while achieving road network accessibility (e.g. road permits) and mobility on primary and secondary roads.  

FY 2019 Project 659 Base funds in the amount of $0.300 million are for Systems Engineering/Program Management (SEPM) for the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) to develop contracting documentation, Systems Engineering Plans (SEP) and Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMP). SEPM includes PM and System Engineering oversight required to manage the program and provide contractor oversight. Salaries, Benefits, Travel, Personnel Training and other Government costs are included for retaining a professional acquisition workforce.

FY 2019 Project 659 Base funds in the amount of $1.679 million are for the research and development of a solution to modify the HETS M1070A1 tractor and increase carrying capacity to 85 tons.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The costs, schedule and technical (performance) requirements are reviewed and compared to the Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) on a regular basis.  Meetings are held monthly to review and discuss status of each program.  Schedules are monitored by the respective Integrated Product Team (IPT) to oversee and compare progress to APB timelines via an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for each program.  All technical requirements are tested and confirmed prior to start of production.  In addition, each program has the ability to perform added tests during production as required to assure technical requirements are being met. The product office also uses Project Recon to perform risk management. The tool is designed to capture, manage, and link Risks, Issues, and Opportunities in a centralized database to create an integrated model that covers the entire program lifecycle.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Semi Trailer Low Bed (STLB) is a 25-ton payload capacity semi-trailer with a fixed goose neck, step deck, and rear loading ramps.  The STLB is interoperable with a variety of trucks residing across the U.S. Army equipment and will be introduced into a theater of operations to transport construction equipment (CE) employed by U.S. Army Engineers to execute horizontal and vertical construction projects in support of U.S. Military or other national goals and objectives. The STLB is employed to transport CE, miscellaneous equipment, disabled equipment, Class IV (construction materials), and logistical provisions. The STLB supports units in the execution of the following tasks: expand the lodgment, construction/upgrade/rehabilitation and maintenance of main supply routes (MSR), alternate supply routes (ASR), logistical facilities, bituminous roads, helipads, airfields, landing strips, motor pools, parking areas, etc. These types of facilities are required for sustainment operations during decisive action operations. The STLB will also be used during routine exercises/deployments, disaster relief, and other nation building operations. The STLB will be capable of supporting mobility, counter mobility, survivability, counter improvised and sustainment needs and all applicable North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) interoperability criteria. 

The Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) is comprised of a M1070A1 Tractor and M1000 Trailer for transport, recovery and evacuation of heavy, oversized combat equipment such as the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank and M88 or similar loads.  The current HETS has two capability gaps; Payload and Road Network Accessibility.  The HETS is not capable of transporting or loading/unloading the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT since it exceeds the HETS rated payload of 70 tons (U.S.).  Road Network Accessibility of the current HETS  is restricted due to exceeding axle load limits CONUS/OCONUS, which prevents the HETS from obtaining road permits.  Short term is an interim solution to modify current HETS tractors and build new HETS trailers and the long term solution is the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) that will address these capability gaps in the future.  

The current interim solution is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) for Heavy Equipment Transporter Systems with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY 2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.  

The Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS) is a force protected tractor and trailer to operationally move and load/unload the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT.  EHETS will be capable of transporting at a higher rated payload and will self-load/unload heavy and outsized equipment such as the Abrams SEPv2 and SEPv3, which currently exceeds the existing Heavy Equipment Transporter System rated capacity of 70-tons (U.S.), while achieving road network accessibility (e.g. road permits) and mobility on primary and secondary roads.  

The Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) supports construction projects by loading, transporting and dumping payloads of sand and gravel aggregates, crushed rock, hot asphalt mixes, earth, clay, rubble, large boulders and other materials up to gross vehicle weight rating to job sites under world-wide climatic conditions.  The HDT also serves as a quarry truck for the quick transport of bulk raw earth material to and from the crushing, screening and washing plant and the asphalt mixing plant.  The HDT also serves as a transportation asset for organizational equipment.  The HDT is Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) compliant with MRAP 1.1 underbody protection.  The armor solution is developed concurrently with the production of armor capable HDTs.  Upon development of the armor solution, the Government procures the armored HDT's.

FY 2019 Project E50 Base funds in the amount of $3.793 million will be used to build Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) Armor Capable Truck Asset Prototypes and Armor Solution testing. The HDT integrated armor requirement is compliant with the Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) Ballistic Specifications.  It is required to replace the F5070, M917 and M917A1 HDTs with the oldest fielded variants at 50 years of age.

FY 2019 Project E50 Base funds in the amount of $1.500 million are for the research and development of a solution to modify the HETS M1070A1 tractor and increase carrying capacity to 85 tons.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The current interim solution for the Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY 2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.

The Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) overall strategy includes a contract to one Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to develop an armor solution for a commercial dump truck.  The commercial dump truck (capable of being armored) will be produced prior to the development of this armor solution.  This armored solution will be tested prior to approval for build to incorporate into the HDT production.  The armored HDT will be procured after successful completion of the armor Live Fire Test (LFT) in FY21.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The costs, schedule and technical (performance) requirements are reviewed and compared to the Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) on a regular basis.  Meetings are held monthly to review and discuss status of each program.  Schedules are monitored by the respective Integrated Product Team (IPT) to oversee and compare progress to APB timelines via an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for each program.  All technical requirements are tested and confirmed prior to start of production.  In addition, each program has the ability to perform added tests during production as required to assure technical requirements are being met. The product office also uses Project Recon to perform risk management. The tool is designed to capture, manage, and link Risks, Issues, and Opportunities in a centralized database to create an integrated model that covers the entire program lifecycle.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element supports periodic, evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection for Heavy Tactical Vehicles (HTV) and Medium Tactical Vehicles (MTV) as described in the Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) Strategy and individual variants' Capability Production Documents.  The upgrades will leverage the Army Technology Objective's (ATO) survivability and Army Research Laboratory's (ARL) research and development activities to develop and evaluate armor kits which increase the protection level of all HTVs to the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) protection level as well as anticipating changing threat environments, protection gaps, or improving the operating performance, efficiency, and reliability through armor weight reduction. This Program Element (PE) also supports increasing crew protection by leveraging advancements in autonomous ground vehicle technology via development and evaluation of autonomous applique kits that can be applied to the current and future HTV fleet.

The Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) supports construction projects by loading, transporting and dumping payloads of sand and gravel aggregates, crushed rock, hot asphalt mixes, earth, clay, rubble, large boulders and other materials up to gross vehicle weight rating to job sites under world-wide climatic conditions.  The HDT also serves as a quarry truck for the quick transport of bulk raw earth material to and from the crushing, screening and washing plant and the asphalt mixing plant.  The HDT also serves as a transportation asset for organizational equipment.  The HDT is Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) compliant with MRAP 1.1 underbody protection.  The armor solution is developed concurrently with the production of armor capable HDTs.  Upon development of the armor solution, the Government procures the armored HDT's.

The Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) is comprised of a M1070A1 Tractor and M1000 Trailer for transport, recovery and evacuation of heavy, oversized combat equipment such as the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank and M88 or similar loads.  The current HETS has two capability gaps; Payload and Road Network Accessibility.  The HETS is not capable of transporting or loading/unloading the heaviest combat platform in the ABCT since it exceeds the HETS rated payload of 70 tons (U.S.).  Road Network Accessibility of the current HETS  is restricted due to exceeding axle load limits CONUS/OCONUS, which prevents the HETS from obtaining road permits.  Short term is an interim solution to modify current HETS tractors and build new HETS trailers.

The current interim solution is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) for Heavy Equipment Transporter Systems with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.  The AROC also directed an additional modification to the tractor that will allow it to achieve an ultimate carrying capacity of 85 tons.

The overall design was enhanced considerably on the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) Underbody Armor Kit and requires live fire testing to support Full Material Release.  The Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) requirement document issued for a Medium Tactical Truck (MTT) with model configuration upgrades needed to support required transport capabilities, armor capabilities, and load dimensions.  This Acquisition Strategy reduces operation and support costs, displaces vehicles which cannot be armored, and results in a more reliable fleet.

FY 2019 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $2.378 million will be used to build two (2) Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) Armor Capable Truck Asset Prototypes and Armor Solution testing. Armor Solution testing costs include system testing, evaluation, and document production for the HDT program. The Government conducts Production Verification Testing (PVT), which includes First Production Vehicle Inspection (FPVI) and Logistics Development on an armor capable HDT, and Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) testing.  Upon development of the armor solution, the Government procures armored HDT's.
                     
FY 2019 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $1.500 million will be used for OGPK/CROWS Weapon Station updates to existing logistic products, as well as hardware development in support of crew served weapons on unarmored and armored trucks.  There have been several survivability enhancements that have occurred since the HEMTT and PLS truck production program began. These enhancements did not incorporate measures to correct for automotive performance degradation that has occurred due to the additional mass of the survivability enhancements. Currently the HEMTTA4 and PLSA1 with top, side, underbody, fuel tank and RPG protection; as well as the addition of a weapon station, have overloaded the truck axles. To regain the original design performance and safety factors, new suspension components are required. 

FY 2019 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $0.800 million will be used for Live Fire Testing of the improvements to the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) A1P2 Underbody Armor Kit that are required to support Full Material Release.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Heavy Dump Truck's overall strategy includes a contract to one Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to develop an armor solution for a commercial dump truck.  The commercial dump truck (capable of being armored) will be produced prior to the development of this armor solution.  This armored solution will be tested prior to approval for build to incorporate to the HDT production.  The armored HDT will be procured after successful completion of the armor live fire test in FY21.

The current interim solution for the Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) is in response to a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS# 17-22207) with deliveries beginning the first quarter of FY 2020. The USAREUR HETS ONS solution shall be capable of carrying 78.5 Tons of payload while achieving host country road permits at a reduced weight of 75 tons. The recommended course of action for satisfying the ONS is to utilize a modified version of the M1070A1 tractor combined with a commercial 8-axle trailer.  Per the 1 DEC 17 Army Requirements Oversight Committee (AROC), this trailer will be capable of carrying 85 tons.

Conduct FMTVA1P2 Underbody Armor Kit Live Fire Testing.  This effort will utilize Government test facilities.

Design, develop, prototype and test new axle, suspension components, and protected weapon station components. The new components will be tested and approved to be released as a stand-alone kit or revision to the current underbody armor kit (aka C-Kit).

Technical Data Package (TDP) Conversion from Prototype-level to Production-level: Funds will be used to convert and release a Production-level TDP. When complete, the kit can be procured.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The cost, schedule and technical (performance) requirements are reviewed and compared to the Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) on a regular basis.  Meetings are held monthly to review and discuss status of each program.  Schedules are monitored by the respective Integrated Product Team (IPT) to oversee and compare progress to APB timelines via an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for each program.  All technical requirements are tested and confirmed prior to start of production.  In addition, each program has the ability to perform added tests during production as required to assure technical requirements are being met. The product office also uses Project Recon to perform risk management. The tool is designed to capture, manage, and link Risks, Issues, and Opportunities in a centralized database to create an integrated model that covers the entire program lifecycle.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds continuous efforts in the development of modernized tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems that will enable safety of aircraft operations.  ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil, military, domestic and international ATC mandates and combat identification requirements.  

Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS), the Army's system of record for Airspace Control (AC) and enroute Air Traffic Services (ATS) within the Army Mission Command Information System (MCIS), requires the development  testing and integration of these new web-based services for AC into common MCIS hardware, while meeting the Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.  Includes development and testing of improvements to the air picture to include Blue Force Tracker correlation and radar fusion capability.  TAIS develops software and hardware for AC web services to operate effectively in a dynamic net-centric interconnected environment and integrates advanced surveillance capabilities to further enhance airspace integration and dynamic management capabilities.  

Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) is an Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system that provides ATS at Army terminal airfields and landing sites at Division, Corps, and Echelons Above Corps to include services for Joint and Allied aircraft.  ATNAVICS will integrate TPX-59 capabilities to control aircraft both Outside of the Continental United States and Continental United States. ATNAVICS will network its radar picture and interrogator data to aviation and joint network nodes through TAIS.  .  As the Department of Defense transitions military aircraft to positional self-reporting technologies, flight information will be captured by the Advanced Surveillance program.  Advanced Surveillance allows ATC reception of aircraft self-reporting data to include the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast and integrates local radar feeds and self-reporting aircraft positional data into a correlated situational awareness air picture. 

Mobile Tower System (MOTS) Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I) upgrades provides the Joint Force Commander or Combatant Commander a highly mobile, self-contained, integrated and reliable information system platform for visual and procedural aircraft deconfliction and aircrew force protection in unified action terminal airspace environments.  The Airfield Lighting System (ALS) is a component of the MOTS and can be operated by solar power or by generator power.  The ALS improvements include a Precision Approach Path Indicator and an ALS trailer charging system.  

Tactical Terminal Control System (TTCS) is a mobile ATC communications system that provides initial ATS at remote landing sites and drop zones. It enables secure ground-to-air and ground-to-ground communications between Army aircraft, other services, Allied aircraft and ground stations. TTCS provides aircraft separation and ground control capabilities, a meteorological measuring system for basic weather information, Blue Force Tracker which provides near real time situational awareness and precision location capability.  Future improvements include incorporating advance surveillance as risk mitigation by improving airspace situational awareness and providing an improved soldier interface that is common with other ATC systems.

ATC Tactical Networking supports the non-recurring engineering, test and evaluation tasks for  integration of radios, control stations and transmitter/receivers and software that will provide all ATC tactical systems an airfield network node capability.  This will enable each ATC system to send voice and data between ATC platforms including connectivity to an external network for long range flight-following and data exchange further reducing aviation operational risk by providing ATC operators a common air picture.  ATC Networking is required to meet the Net Ready Key Performance Parameter for ATC tactical systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This project is comprised of multiple systems supporting ATC development and test efforts.  While the detailed acquisition strategy varies by program, the general strategy for each program is to complete development and testing efforts through contract modifications, engineering service tasks, and new/follow-on contracts.  ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil, military, domestic and international air traffic control and upcoming Next Gen requirements and mandates as well as current aircraft self-reporting transponders.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)) will be a man-packable, small (&lt;25lbs), highly mobile, unmanned robotic system with advanced sensors/mission modules for dismounted Service Members. The CRS(I) will be designed so operator can quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and/or payloads.  The CRS(I) will also include the Army universal controller used by all unmanned ground and aerial vehicles within the battalion formation providing interoperability, logistics, and training efficiencies.  The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces.  This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the Operating Environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated War-fighting Force by providing standoff to the War fighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations.

The Robotics Enhanced Program (REP) uses a "buy, try, and inform" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness.  Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a Cost-Benefit Analysis to support future Army decision making.

Robotics Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts.  It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interface, common software and universal controllers.  RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET), Leader/Follower (LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System (RCIS), Common Robotics System-Vehicle (CRS(V)), CRS(I) Inc II, etc.) and new standards addressing emerging requirements (i.e. Cyber Security, Information Assurance, new payloads, etc).     

Robotics Development (RD) includes efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, validate material solutions and determine initial Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in support of pre-Material Development Decision (MDD) activities for emerging requirements and programs of record. RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&amp;T) projects, REP initiatives and/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities.  This line is for robotic systems that are transported by individual Soldiers, by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. SMET, Leader/Follower (LF), Route Clearance Interrogation Systems (RCIS),  CRS(V), CRS(I) Inc II, Soldier Born Sensors, etc) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support AoA that include Army Material Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND Corporatin studies, and/or modeling to increase confidence in the material solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)/Capability Production Document(CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The CRS(I) program will enter  MS B, conduct a source selection board and complete EMD contract award(s) beginning in 3QFY17.   
REP will continue to inform emerging robotic system requirements and risk reduction initiatives per SOP and MOA, to include 16.1 and 16.2 project reviews and complete REP 17.1and 17.2 demonstrations.   REP initiatives will be completed and published for PEO review at Knowledge Point 2 for program effectiveness and efficiency.
RA will monitor, validate, and update IOP for MTRS and CRS(I) instantiations as well as continuous revision for cyber security and information assurance. RA will also initiate development of SMET and LF instantiations.  
RD will initiate Pre-MDD activities to support AoA and draft CDD for SMET, LF and RCIS to include follow-on S&amp;T activities and REP to support emerging requirements.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This project includes GMV and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle - Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV). Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) was a new start program in FY17. Joint
Light Tactical Vehicle- Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV) is a new start program in FY18.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) provides enhanced tactical mobility for an Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) 9-Soldier infantry squad with their associated equipment to move quickly around the battlefield.  This capability is required across the range of military operations facing IBCT units conducting crises response, initial entry, and selected decisive action missions. GMV deploys worldwide by sea, air, and land modes to support strategic deployment and operational maneuver in accordance with Army and Joint doctrine. This capability provides flexibility for entry operations (permissive and non-permissive) to counter threat anti-access strategies by using multiple austere entry points to bring in combined arms configured units.

The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle - Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV) was designated as the interim solution (2016 AROCM16-11.2) for the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV) to address a near term capability gap identified in the U.S. Army Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy for the IBCT Cavalry Squadrons and Infantry Battalion Scout Platoons. This effort includes increased precision lethality through improved optics and a larger caliber weapon system to provide overmatch and counter threats as forces perform reconnaissance, surveillance and security operations.

FY19 GMV budget activities include Contractor Test Support, PQT testing to support FMR for A-GMV 1.1. testing, and program management support.

FY19 JLTV-LRV budget activities include Contractor Test Support, safety, performance, reliability, and ballistic testing of the JLTV-LRV, and program management support.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) provides enhanced tactical mobility for an Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) 9-Soldier infantry squad with their associated equipment to move quickly around the battlefield.  This capability is required across the range of military operations facing IBCT units conducting crises response, initial entry, and selected decisive action missions. GMV deploys worldwide by sea, air, and land modes to support strategic deployment and operational maneuver in accordance with Army and Joint doctrine. This capability provides flexibility for entry operations (permissive and non-permissive) to counter threat anti-access strategies by using multiple austere entry points to bring in combined arms configured units.

The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle - Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV) was designated as the interim solution (2016 AROCM16-11.2) for the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV) to address a near term capability gap identified in the U.S. Army Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy for the IBCT Cavalry Squadrons and Infantry Battalion Scout Platoons. This effort includes increased precision lethality through improved optics and a larger caliber weapon system to provide overmatch and counter threats as forces perform reconnaissance, surveillance and security operations.

FY19 GMV budget activities include Contractor Test Support, PQT testing to support FMR for A-GMV 1.1. testing, and program management support.

FY19 JLTV-LRV budget activities include monitoring of Contractor Test Support, safety, performance, reliability, and ballistic testing of the JLTV-LRV, and program management support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) Phase I: Per the Directed Requirement, procure the GMV capability for 5 Airborne IBCTS through the SOCOM GMV1.1 contract.
GMV Phase II: Pursue development of the GMV to fulfill the requirements for the remainder of the IBCTs using a commercial item. A firm fixed priced contract will be awarded through full and open competition. Funding for Phase II will be competed in the FY19-23 POM with an expectation that contract award would be in FY20.

Pursue development of the LRV to fulfill near term capability gap identified in the U.S. Army Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy for the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) Cavalry Squadrons and Infantry Battalion Scout Platoons. The Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV) MEP will be incorporated into the current JLTV Technical Data Battalion Scout Platoons. The LRV MEP will be incorporated into the current JLTV Technical Data Package (TDP) and will be a kit option on the next JLTV contract. The program is planning for the next production contract to be awarded through full and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides night vision/reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition technologies required for United States defense forces to engage enemy forces twenty-four hours a day under conditions of degraded visibility due to darkness, adverse weather, battlefield obscurants, foliage and man-made structures.  These developments and improvements to high performance night vision electro-optics, radar, laser, and thermal systems and integration of related multi-sensor suites will enable near to long range target acquisition, identification and engagement to include significant fratricide reduction, which will improve battlefield command and control in "around-the-clock" combat operations.  

Project EQ9 focuses on a kit of electronic devices that acquires, collects, and transmits data to provide near real time feedback in order to validate, follow, locate, or track a target (i.e., tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL)).  Using  electronic audio and/or video recorders, information obtained will validate movement and identify targets.  In addition, threat monitoring can be integrated into existing operational tools, help to paint a clearer picture of the battlefield, pinpoint possible target locations, and identify and exploit enemy movements and patterns.  Close Access Target Reconnaissance (CATR) has been fielded since 2005 as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program. 

Project L67 develops, improves and miniaturizes high performance night vision electro-optics, thermal and laser systems.  It also provides for systems integration of related multi-sensor suites to enable near to long-range target acquisition and engagement as well as improved battlefield command and control in around-the-clock combat operations. It focuses on adapting demonstrated technologies that bring improvements to the dismounted Soldiers' equipment.  This project develops or enhances equipment that provides the individual Soldier's day/night situational awareness and individual targeting capability. This project includes cost associated with efforts for integration and interface of products on Soldiers head, body and weapons.

Project L70 focuses on night vision, reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) sensor and suites of sensors to provide well-defined surveillance and targeting capabilities for a variety of Current, Modular, and Future Force platforms. This project includes: 3rd Generation Forward Looking Infra-Red (3GEN FLIR) B-Kit development activities, the 3GEN Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3) Modification Work Order (MWO) to integrate 3GEN FLIR B-Kit, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology ASA(ALT) Common Operating Environment (COE) effort to meet sensor interoperability requirements and improve the soldier-machine interface of the Program of Record (POR).

Project L75 focuses on development of Profiler Block enhanced capabilities for meteorological (MET) measurement sensors and data.  Improvements have reduced the footprint (less soldiers/vehicles) and complexity of the system, improved performance (accuracy), improved survivability, connectivity, no balloon sensor, multiple initialization data, and terrain visualization. The improved MET message data will increase lethality by enabling artillery a greater probability of first round hit with indirect fire systems.  Profiler Block III provides a networked laptop configuration while further reducing the system's logistics footprint with the elimination of the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) mounted shelter and trailer located in the Tactical Operations Center (TOC).  The Profiler Virtual Module (PVM), a product improvement to the Block III, concept includes the following updates: update of weather model; update of software architecture removing legacy Block I code and creating a modular framework; development in conjunction with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) program including AFATDS, to provide increased interoperability and usability; and to enable operation of the Profiler system in a virtual machine for use in the Common Operating Environment (COE) versions 2,3,4,and 5.  This concept is a flexible approach that supports use of existing Block III hardware, increased accuracy during technical refresh of hardware with higher performance computers, and virtualization on the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) server. 

Project L76 matures technologies and capabilities which benefit the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR, AN/PED-1, AN/PED-1A, and AN/PED-1B) and the Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS).  These precision targeting and next generation systems are used by dismounted Soldiers to locate, identify, and target enemy assets. This project focuses on reducing size, weight, power and cost, improving imaging performance, and increasing targeting accuracy. Targeting accuracy improvements will focus on developing and integrating affordable, non-magnetic, high accuracy, full-time (24/7), and all weather Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices, with reduced size, weight, and power characteristics into the LLDR system. Long term goals include improving current celestial navigation systems to increase operational availability, developing precision targeting capabilities that will operate in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment to improve situational awareness, and to integrate Military Global Positioning System (GPS) User Equipment (M-Code) (next-generation GPS) receivers into LLDR and JETS, when available.

Project L79 focuses on the Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS). JETS is an Army program with joint information (Air Force and Marine Corps). JETS will meet the one-man, hand-held precision targeting gap identified by the Fires Center of Excellence (FCOE). JETS is a light-weight, handheld system that will provide the single dismounted observer and Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) with a common, enhanced day and night thermal capability to rapidly acquire, accurately locate, positively identify, and precisely designate targets. JETS Target Location and Designation System (TLDS) will be able to interface with existing and future Forward Entry Systems (FESs) and operate in environments where global positioning system (GPS) capabilities are degraded or denied including the integration of military GPS user equipment (M-Code) GPS receivers, when they become available. This project will address continued development and integration of improved precision targeting components to reduce size, weight, power, and cost of systems for dismounted precisions Fires mission.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The family utilizes advancements in thermal and low light level sensors to produce Individual (I), Crew-Served (CS), and Sniper (S) weapon sights operable in-line with a day optic or in stand-alone mode.  This project integrates smaller pixel focal plane arrays in multiple large format sizes to improve sensitivity, clarity, and range, while simultaneously reducing the size, weight and power consumption of all variants.  The FWS-I variant is a weapon mounted long-wave infrared sensor that enables Soldiers to fire quickly and accurately from any carry position and with significantly reduced exposure to enemy fire by providing a wireless zeroed weapon aimpoint in the Soldier's Enhanced Night Vision Goggle III (ENVG III) goggle or day display on the helmet. Leveraging the success of the Individual variant development, the FWS-CS variant operates as the primary sight; it includes a wireless Helmet Mount Display (HMD) and provides the Soldier with input from a laser range finder device, resulting in a more accurate aimpoint that adjusts automatically for range, ammunition characteristics, and vertical angle. The FWS-S variant mounts in-line with the Sniper's direct view optic providing a thermal imagery capability to the host weapon at the weapon's maximum effective range, plus 20% overmatch.  FWS-S provides Snipers a large format display with increased pixel density that enables accurate long range engagements while maintaining day sight, extending the lethality and provide exceptional observation.  The modified FWS- CS Light program will leverage the advancements in technology from the FWS and will support Combat support and Service Support units with a FWS -CS Light.  This also supports Thermal Weapon Sight obsolesce through the Future Years Defense Plan.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The ENVG-B system is a modular helmet-mounted, passive electro-optical night vision and long wave infrared (LWIR) imaging device in a binocular configuration. The system integrates dual Image Intensification (I2) sensors with the LWIR imagery into a single viewing display. The LWIR sensor provides the Soldier with the capability to rapidly detect and recognize human-sized targets in adverse weather and obscurants and in varying light conditions.  The dual I2 sensors provide the Soldier with depth perception for ease of low-light level maneuvers and the ability to detect rifle-mounted aiming lights to engage targets. The ENVG-B can also be operated in a monocular configuration by moving one of the two individually rotating monoculars. The ENVG-B has a near infrared (NIR) emitting light source that provides illumination for close-up viewing. The ENVG-B mounts on current Soldier equipment, including the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), the Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) and Integrated Head Protection System (IHPS).  The ENVG-B has a multi-point wireless interface to the FWS-I weapon mounted LWIR sensor and to Nett Warrior in order to support information assurance requirements. The ENVG-B wirelessly operates with the FWS-I to provide Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) capability.  RTA is the capability to view the boresighted/zeroed weapon sight reticle in the ENVG-B display, enabling the Soldier to accurately engage targets without having to bring the weapon to eye level and without the use of active lasers, all while remaining in defilade.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project performs Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) on high performance night vision, Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) systems and other related systems that allow forces to locate and track enemy units in day, night, and all battlefield conditions, and through natural and man-made structures and obscurants.  It also develops and integrates suites of these sensors to provide well-defined surveillance and targeting capabilities, as well as architectures for these sensors to communicate automatically.  These efforts focus on meeting the requisite night vision and RSTA capabilities required for evolving Current Force, Modular Force, and Future Force systems.

The project supports the 3rd Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) B-Kit EMD program, which incorporates the next generation of forward looking infrared technologies.  The 3GEN FLIR EMD program will develop a common 3GEN FLIR B-Kit for integration into US Army FLIR sensor systems in accordance with the approved Improved Forward Looking Infrared (I-FLIR) Capability Development Document (CDD).  The common 3GEN FLIR B-Kit prescribed by the I-FLIR CDD will allow the Army to achieve economies of scale and avoid duplicative engineering and development costs.  As a result, 3GEN FLIR capabilities can be delivered at a lower cost to the Abrams, Bradley, and Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3), while potentially leveraging 3GEN FLIR components for airborne applications.  The 3GEN FLIR B-Kit provides Mid Wave Infrared and Long Wave Infrared digital video and the electronic interfaces required to integrate the 3GEN FLIR technology with the host platform sensor.  When integrated in current sensor packages, 3GEN FLIR technology enhances the war-fighters' survivability and lethality through increased identification range performance, while enabling the detection of difficult or obscured targets and faster threat detection through automated processes.  The 3GEN FLIR B-Kit EMD program is also a key element in maintaining the Army's FLIR industrial base.

The project supports LRAS3 Modification Work Order (MWO) to integrate 3GEN FLIR B-Kit.  The LRAS3 MWO effort includes integration of 3GEN FLIR B-Kit technology, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and an M-code Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.  Collectively, these capabilities will improve the Far Target Location (FTL) accuracy of the LRAS3 and enhance the scout's survivability and lethality through increased detection, recognition and identification range performance.  Plan to transition 3GEN LRAS3 from BA5 funding to BA7 funding in future years.

This project also executes the Army Sensor Computing Environment (CE) effort which is part of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA-ALT) Common Operating Environment (COE) program.  The Sensor CE effort focuses on increasing sensor interoperability across the enterprise and improving the Soldier-machine interface.  This is done by defining, demonstrating and standardizing Sensor interfaces across the Army networks.  Standardized interfaces delivered from this effort will be incorporated into current and future sensor systems and programs.

FY 2019 Base Funding in the amount of $53.737 million supports the 3GEN FLIR B-Kit EMD program activities as well as the initiation of the 3GEN LRAS3 Modification Work Order (MWO) effort to integrate 3GEN FLIR B-Kit, an IMU, and an M-code GPS receiver.  Additionally, FY 2019 Base Funding supports the continued activities associated with meeting sensor interoperability requirements and improving the Soldier-machine interface in support of the Army's vision of the Common Operating Environment (COE).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>3GEN FLIR: Materiel Development Decision (MDD) was received from the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) and the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed on 22-Dec-2014.  Per the ADM, 3GEN FLIR entered the acquisition lifecycle at Milestone B (MS B) in 2Q FY 2016.  After a successful MS B decision, competitive EMD contracts were awarded to design, develop, integrate and test the 3GEN FLIR B-Kit prior to production and mitigate the industrial base risk.  The host platforms are responsible for integration of the 3GEN FLIR B-Kit.

3GEN Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3): After a Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) review, 3GEN LRAS3 will perform technical trade studies to determine modifications required to the current LRAS3 to integrate 3GEN FLIR B-Kit technology, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and an M-coded Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.  Contract preparation activities for the Modification Work Order (MWO) award are planned for 2Q FY 2020.   

Sensor CE: Additional Fiscal Year 2019 activities include continued development of the sensor interoperability requirement and improving the Soldier-machine interface in support of the Army's vision of the Common Operating Environment (COE).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Profiler Virtual Module (PVM) provides meteorological (MET) data that includes wind speed, wind direction, temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity information required for use in the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). The correctional information is necessary for precise targeting and terminal guidance to Field Artillery assets. PVM improves accuracy of predictive fires solutions and allows for first round effects on target and reduces the risk of fratricide. This capability increases the lethality of indirect fire systems such as the rocket launchers, self-propelled or towed howitzers, and mortars.

FY 2019 Base funding is $0.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures technologies and capabilities which benefit the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR, AN/PED-1, AN/PED-1A, and AN/PED-1B) and the Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS). These precision targeting and next generation systems are used by dismounted Soldiers to locate, identify, and target enemy assets. This project focuses on reducing size, weight, power and cost, improving imaging performance, and increasing targeting accuracy. Targeting accuracy improvements will focus on developing and integrating affordable, non-magnetic, high accuracy, full-time (24/7), and all weather Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices, with reduced size, weight, and power characteristics into the LLDR system. Long term goals include improving current celestial navigation systems to increase operational availability, developing precision targeting capabilities that will operate in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment to improve situational awareness, and to integrate Military Global Positioning System (GPS) User Equipment (M-Code) (next-generation GPS) receivers into LLDR and JETS, when available.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) is an Army program with joint information (Air Force and Marine Corps). JETS will meet the one-man, hand-held precision targeting gap identified by the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE). JETS is a light-weight, handheld system that will provide the single dismounted observer and Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) with a common, enhanced day and night thermal capability to rapidly acquire, accurately locate, positively identify, and precisely designate targets. JETS Target Location and Designation System (TLDS) will be able to interface with existing and future Forward Entry Systems (FESs) and operate in environments where global positioning system (GPS) capabilities are degraded or denied including the integration of military GPS user equipment (M-Code) GPS receivers, when they become available. This project will address continued development and integration of improved precision targeting components to reduce size, weight, power, and cost of systems for dismounted precisions Fires mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Projects under this Program Element support the development, demonstration and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) evaluation of combat feeding equipment to enhance soldier efficiency, improve soldier survivability, and reduce food service logistics requirements for all four services. These Projects support multi-fuel, rapidly deployable field food service equipment initiatives. Efforts also support the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of programs to improve equipment, enhance safety in food service, and decrease fuel and water requirements. The Projects develop critical enablers that support the Joint Future Capabilities and Joint Expeditionary mindset, by maintaining readiness through integrating new equipment, enhancing the field soldier's well-being, and providing soldiers usable equipment. The Projects also reduce sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands on lift, the combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.


This PE/Project supports Field Feeding programs for all the services.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Efforts funded in this Project support all four Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The Army serves as the Executive Agent for this Department of Defense (DoD) program, with oversight and coordination provided by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board (CFREB) as required by DoD Directive (DoDD) 3235.02E. Centralized execution of the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Program (CFREP) with Joint Service review and approval eliminates unnecessary duplication of efforts across the Services and maximizes use of common materiel solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the development, demonstration and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) evaluation of combat feeding equipment to enhance Soldier efficiency, improve Soldier survivability, and reduce food service logistics requirements for the Army. The Project supports multi-fuel, rapidly deployable field food service equipment initiatives. Efforts also support the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of programs to improve equipment, enhance safety in food service, and decrease fuel and water requirements. The Projects develop critical enablers that support the Army's Strategic Planning Guidance by developing and integrating critical expeditionary capabilities that maintain readiness, providing effective solutions that reduce the resource and operational energy footprint, providing modernized equipment, and enhancing the field Soldier's well being. This project reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands on lift, the combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.


This PE/Project supports Field Feeding programs for the Army.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA) program is the foundation architecture of the Live Training Transformation Family of Training Systems (LT2-FTS). The program contains critical core product-line architecture which provides commonality across training instrumentation systems and interoperability across Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE) and joint training systems. CTIA includes Army owned software components, architecture services, standards, protocols and governance used by domain-specific Live Training Transformation (LT2) and Live Training Systems (LTS) to include instrumented Force-On-Force (FOF) and Force-On-Target (FOT) training requirements. The CTIA also provides Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) and technology refresh for the LT2 family of LTS supporting over 21 live instrumented training products which are fielded at over 200 CONUS and OCONUS sites across the Army.

Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) funds the continued development of the existing Instrumentation Systems (IS) at the National Training Center (NTC), Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) and Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC). CTC-IS funds the continued development of the Range Communication System at the NTC and JRTC, to provide high-fidelity live, virtual, and constructive brigade training rotations which prepare Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint partners, and supporting units to deploy in support of the Army Sustainable Readiness Model (SRM).  The CTCs primary goal is to develop agile and adaptive leaders at the tactical, operational and strategic levels while providing BCTs the core training necessary to conduct decisive action in a dynamic operating environment.  

The Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) program provides realistic, real-time casualty effects for force-on-force tactical engagement training scenarios and its ability to integrate into training instrumentation systems provide for high fidelity combined arms combat exercises supporting the 39th Chief of the Staff of the Army #1 priority of "Readiness".  Due to their modular design, I-MILES is required for use at the Home Station, the Combat Training Centers (CTCs) and in theater of operations to meet force-on-force training requirements.  I-MILES program funding provides the Development and Integration of new vehicle and dismount weapon systems meeting the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirements, as well as embedded Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES) development.  This includes development efforts of the Live Training Engagement Composition (LTEC), increasing simulation of Probability of Kill (Pk) for training realism and improving integration on new weapon platforms (i.e. Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), M4A2 plus Rifle and Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) with 30mm Gun).

The Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) provides a high-fidelity deployable instrumented training capability to support platoon thru battalion level Live Force-on-Force Training. HITS tracks location of soldiers and vehicles and simulates weapons' effects and engagements, allowing units to "Train as they Fight" against live opponents. HITS provides accurate feedback to training units. HITS consists of light deployable components that can be rapidly assembled/disassembled and transported to support deployed training. HITS integrates with future and legacy MILES. HITS is a member of the Live Training Transformation (LT2) family of training systems and shares several hardware and software components with the Instrumentation Systems (IS). HITS provides the Live domain for Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) training integration.

The Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) provides realistic medical training to both medical and non-medical Soldiers in the Active, Reserve, and National Guard. MSTCs provide hands-on instruction on the latest battlefield trauma and critical care techniques based on Army Medical Department (AMEDD) approved performance oriented Program of Instruction (POI). Medical treatment validation exercises simulate the high stress of performing medical interventions in combat. MSTC supports Unit Medical Readiness by validating Combat Medic (68W) Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) biennial recertification requirements and provides Combat Lifesaver (CLS) training to non-medical Soldiers.

The Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is the unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot), which includes escalation of force/graduated response scenarios.

The Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) family of systems is a lightweight, rapidly deployable, observed fire training system that provides simulated battlefield training for Fire Support Specialists (FSS), Joint Fires Observers (JFO), and Soldiers. The system provides simulated battlefield training to conduct Indirect Fires, Close Air Support, Close Combat Attack, and Naval Surface Fire Support. The CFFT Immersive System provides the capability for Army, Joint, Multinational and Special Operations Forces to conduct advanced, complex and realistic fires training at the FIRES Center of Excellence, Ft Sill, OK. CFFT is a critical training enabler to support Warfighters in applying precision fires on target to prevent fratricide and minimize collateral damage.

The Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) provides a net-centric linkage that collects, retrieves and exchanges data among LVC Training Aids, Devices, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS) (to include: AVCATT, CCTT, GFT, HITS, JLCCTC and SE Core) and Mission Command Systems. The LVC-IA defines "how" information is exchanged among the different LVC domains and the Mission Command Systems. The LVC-IA provides enterprise level tools for exercise control, after action review, and system information assurance. It develops hardware and software to interface the different Live, Virtual, Constructive and Gaming communication protocols and to provide a correlated common operating picture for the training audience on their organic Mission Command equipment. The integration of the LVC TADSS with the Mission Command equipment will enable larger and more robust training events, to better prepare U.S. Soldiers for their missions at an overall reduced cost. The end-state goal is to enable an LVC Integrated Training Environment that can replicate Operational Environments in a cost effective manner to provide a high level of value-added training and mission rehearsal opportunities to Army Commanders and their Soldiers. In FY18, the LVC-IA program will begin design and developmental activities for Version 4 which will allow for "cloud optimization"; inclusion of new simulations to the architecture; and concurrency with core system TADSS and Army Mission Command Systems.  FY19 request will allow for the continued Version 4 developmental and integration activities as well as concurrency with mission command systems.

The Target Modernization program provides a common open architectural framework, standards, specifications, and interfaces for live fire target devices, a common target control system for all range types, and innovative technologies to enhance training realism and reduce life cycle costs on the ranges. The Target Modernization primary goal is the development of trackless target systems, high fidelity dynamic infrared representations, non-contact ballistic hit detections, and augmented reality on live fire ranges; increasing training realism and lowering life cycle costs.

The Army identified an operational gap in the training strategy for the OPFOR Integrated Air Defense System (IADS). It's a collection of enemy weapons systems that engage Army aviation assets. Training Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Stimulation Suite (TASS) is a live training system consisting of aircraft components and ground emitters that replicate current and emerging enemy Air Defense systems. Its fidelity supports individual pilot training as well as the collective training requirements of the Brigade Combat Team to fully plan, prepare, execute and react against an enemy air defense weapons at the Combat Training Centers (CTC).  

The Digital Range Training System (DRTS) provides new and modern ranges capable of training, evaluating and stressing Soldiers and their modern equipment in a realistic train-as-you-fight environment. The system consists of four standard training ranges:  Digital Multi-Purpose Range Complex (DMPRC), Digital Multi-Purpose Training Range (DMPTR), Battle Area Complex (BAX) and Digital Air Ground Integration Range (DAGIR) which utilize all available combat systems capabilities, and digitally integrate them to manage all forces undergoing individual and collective live-fire training and qualification. These training systems replace obsolete, inadequate training methods and equipment in order to simulate new weapon systems, challenge Soldiers, incorporate the modern digital force, and provide enhanced training data collection and After Action Review (AAR) capabilities. The system incorporates digital system training, as well as integrates multiple ranges and training environments for the training units.

The Army identified a requirement for a Soldier and Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT) to replace the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) II and Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) III program capabilities, while also providing immersive collective training capability to maneuver squads. The S/SVT program will enable Army Readiness through dismounted collective maneuver capability; will provide individual and crew-served weapons skill development, will enable Joint fires training, and will exercise Use of Force decision making. The requirement will integrate with the Synthetic Training Environment (STE), which is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units at the point of need within the entire range of Multi-Domain Battle tasks in support of Unified Land Operations in a complex operational environment. 

OPFOR Surrogate Wheeled Vehicles (OSWV) provides a collection of wheeled vehicles, used as training aids to portray threat vehicles including tactical vehicles, technical vehicles, and Civilian on the Battlefield vehicles (COB-V). The program supports the CTC OPFOR/COE Pillar capability through technical vehicles, unique VISMODs, and COB-Vs. This capability provides for an accurate replication of OPFOR and COB-Vs environment that rotational units must train against.

FY 2019 Project 241 funds significant development efforts in support of U.S. Army Training and Readiness on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES), Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), Target Modernization, Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), OPFOR Integrated Air Defense System (IADS), Soldier Virtual Trainer Program (SVT), OPFOR Surrogate Wheeled Vehicles (OSWV) a new start, and Suicide Prevention.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>RDTE of $.250 million provides for the design, development, and testing of the Trackless Moving Target - Vehicle (TMT-V) platform system.  The TMT-V effort will design and prototype an inexpensive trackless vehicle/armor moving type target that can be utilized on unimproved terrain.  The TMT-V is capable of replicating behaviors based on training doctrine, skills, readiness and style of learning to enhance realism and feedback for the trainee.  

RDTE of $1.670 million provides for the design and development of the Dynamic Infrared Projection (DIRP) system.  The DIRP system will provide for an inexpensive and ruggedized infrared projection system that can be utilized to create accurate real-time dynamic thermal representations on target silhouettes or other mediums based on training doctrine within the various live and virtual training applications to enhance realism and feedback for the trainee.  The DIRP system technology would support the creation of a high fidelity, time and posture based, thermal replication system for live fire target systems. Current solutions are heating pads adhered to the target silhouette.  The shapes are not accurate, get damaged with live fire engagements, and create thermal bleeding; the shapes are static with respect to time, and do not support changes in thermal intensity over time, movement or posture changes.  The DIRP solution will remove the threat signature thermal generation from the line of fire (damage), and support the recognition of combat vehicles with high resolution imaging.  The thermal images will support time or movement based increases in temperature, and enhanced thermal representation (muzzle flash, burning vehicle), resulting in enhanced training realism.  The FY19 efforts include conducting a domain analysis, completing the detail design, and image modeling and development.</r2:Text>

In addition, funding will be used to develop a prototype Integrated Player Unit (IPU) for the DRTS system that combines the multiple boxes used today into one unit, makes the IPU more rugged to withstand the operational environment, and makes the system easier and faster to install. This will make the DRTS more usable by the training units and easier to support. This is the first year of RDTE for the DRTS program.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Competitive development efforts based on performance specifications.
1.  In FY17, Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS) System RDTE funded the development of a Cross Domain Solution (CDS) needed due to new IA requirements; awarded a new delivery order (DO) to General Dynamics Missions Systems under the Live Training Transformation Consolidated Product-line Management Next (LT2 CPM Next) contract. CPM Next was completed as a Competitive 5 year Single Award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract, the DO will have a one-year base and four single-year option period. 
FY18 and FY19, will be used to fund a Life Cycle Product-line Management (LCPM) contract structured as a 5 year Single Award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) for the implementation of a Hardware Product Line (HPL), the contractor is to be selected. The strategy is to establish a deliberate approach to Life Cycle Management (LCM) of Live Training Family of Systems, providing the framework for future Life Cycle Efforts for the Hardware Product Line Framework.
2.  In FY17, Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) awarded a new delivery order (DO) to General Dynamics Mission Systems on the Live Training Transformation Consolidated Product-line Management Next (LT2 CPM Next) contract which will provide flexibility for unknown requirements and will address the known requirements that fall within multiple categories: Architecture Maturation; Common Operating Environment (COE); Embedded Training; System level testing of existing and future Live Training Engagement Composition (LTEC) services for dismount and vehicle use cases; Architecture Verification/Validation of LTEC and a componentized architecture; Retrofitting I-MILES systems (Individual Weapons System 1 &amp; 2 (IWS), Tactical Vehicle System (TVS), Combat Vehicle Tactical Engagement Simulation System (CVTESS)) with LTEC and Live Player Area Network (LPAN); Development, Integration, Form, Fit &amp; Function for new vehicles/systems platforms. In FY18, I-MILES will award a new Competitive 5 year Single Award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for relevancy. 
3.  In FY16, the Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) program awarded a delivery order (DO) to General Dynamics Missions Systems under the LT2 CPM Next contract. The DO has a one-year base and four single-year option periods beginning in January 2016. 
4.  In FY15, the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA) program awarded a contract to General Dynamics Mission Systems which has a one-year base and four single-year option periods through FY20. 
5.  In FY17, the Target Modernization (Target Mod) program incrementally funded the Phase III SBIR contract to Pratt and Miller Engineering Trackless Moving Target (TMT) contract which has a one year base and two year options periods. The contract provides for the continued product development (from TRL 7 to TRL 9). The original effort was initiated under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract. In FY18, Target Mod will award a Phase III SBIR to JRM Enterprises to initiate the maturation of the Dynamic Infrared Representation system (TRL 7 to TRL 9).
6. The LVC-IA Enhanced Capability contract is the competitively awarded follow-on effort awarded in 3rd Quarter FY16.  This contract has a two-year base and four single-year option periods to provide the additional capabilities for Versions 3, 4 and beyond.  The contract was awarded to Cole Engineering and Science, Inc. (CESI) to provide for the development, fielding and training of each version capability for the designated Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) sites and provide Post-Deployment Software Support (PDSS) for all currently fielded versions.
7.  The Soldier and Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT) program will employ an incremental acquisition strategy where the full capability will occur in multiple increments as new capability is developed and delivered. Competitive prototyping development efforts will be conducted through Other Transactional Authority. 
8.  Digital Range Training System (DRTS) will award two standalone delivery orders (DO) to General Dynamics Mission Systems which will be 12-month prototyping efforts.  This is the first year of RDTE for this program.  
9.  In FY17, OPFOR Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) awarded a new standalone contract with a base, plus 4 option year periods. 
10. As of FY17, the Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) team will be performing TC3 Sim concurrency and ISS enhancement efforts using other Army agency fixed price contracts. 
11. In FY19, OPFOR Surrogate Wheeled Vehicles (OSWV) will pursue an organic solution to develop, integrate and test Visual Modifications for Tactical and Technical Vehicles.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronic Protection Enhancement (AEPE) Program funds efforts to assess and initiate development of solutions to Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) vulnerabilities from Advanced Electronic Attack (AEA).  Army AMD sensors, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Command and Control (C2), and Radio Frequency (RF) data and voice networks will be assessed against current and postulated AEA systems and techniques.  Potential Electronic Protection (EP) solutions developed by the Army will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated AEA environments.  Similarly, EP solutions developed by the Joint services and other Agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency) will also be assessed for potential incorporation into Army AMD systems.

The Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of Air and Missile Defense (AMD) operations at all echelons. AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Brigades (BDEs), Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCT's), Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions/Corps. AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems. ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, BDEs and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities. They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces. AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the Air &amp; Missile Defense (AMD) Battalions. AMDPCS has three major components: (1) The Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational 3-dimensional air picture.  AMDWS is the air picture provider for the Army, producing an integrated and correlated air picture at all tactical levels and locations. AMDWS is also an integral component of Integrated Base Defense. AMDWS provides an interoperability link to multinational air defense forces; (2) The Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is a communications data link processor and display system that provides near-real time, 3-dimensional and joint airspace situational awareness; (3) The Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, Common Hardware Systems, standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions, direct forces, and manage airspace.  The integration of the Passive Identification, Friend or Foe (PIFF) capability into sheltered systems enables AMDPCS to track self-reporting aircraft. PIFF receives position and identification data from self-reporting aircraft, to include UAS, within 250 nautical miles.

The Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system-of-systems (SoS) is an evolutionary, non-developmental program that detects RAM launches; provides localized warning to the defended area, with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercepts rounds in flight, thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhances response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors, command and control (C2) equipment, a commercial industry-produced warning system, and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)), all connected via a wireless local area network.  The Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, also under the management of the C-RAM Program Directorate, provides the C-RAM C2 functionality and has been enhanced to integrate the sensors, weapons, and warning systems for the C-RAM SoS.  C-RAM C2 software correlates RAM sensor data, evaluates the threat, provides early warning, directs engagements, and cues counterfire systems and reaction forces.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in Afghanistan and Iraq providing correlated air and ground pictures to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Networks, and using various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information to synchronize and optimize automated Shape, Sense, Warn, Intercept, Respond, and Protect decisions.

Multiple acquisition efforts are associated with the C-RAM program, including C-RAM Intercept, which fields existing LPWS guns to two Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)/Avenger composite Battalions, and RAM Warn, a horizontal technology insertion, using current C-RAM warning capability to provide early, localized warning to all Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCT).

The Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) capability is being developed in response to a Joint Operational Needs (JUON), CC-0558 approved by the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) in June 2016.  Project FG5 was created in FY 2017 to support the identification, development, testing, evaluation and integration of technologies to provide an overall evolutionary capability to defeat small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) threats.  The C-UAS system will provide the capability for the warfighter to comprehensively detect, track, identify and defeat enemy Groups 1 and 2 light weight, Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UAS.  The C-UAS system development involves a phased development and testing approach of C-UAS systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronic Protection Enhancement (AEPE) Program funds efforts to assess and initiate development of solutions to Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) vulnerabilities from Advanced Electronic Attack (AEA).  Army AMD sensors, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Command and Control (C2), and Radio Frequency (RF) data and voice networks will be assessed against current and postulated AEA systems and techniques.  Potential Electronic Protection (EP) solutions developed by the Army will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated AEA environments.  Similarly, EP solutions developed by the Joint services and other Agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency) will also be assessed for potential incorporation into Army AMD systems.

The initial assessment event was conducted in 2QFY15.  Subsequent events will be conducted approximately every two (2) years. Analysis and implementation that provide AEA solutions will occur between events and will be assessed at the next event after implementation.  

The following tasks were developed based on previous AEPE demonstration results and the following planned activities will assess the AEA impacts on AMD components and development of countermeasures. The tasks for AEPE are: (1) Plan and execute periodic AEPE demonstrations with Army AMD systems and perform post-demonstration analysis.  Integrate Joint service and other Agency AMD systems into AEPE demonstrations as appropriate.  (2) Upon completion of AEPE demonstration analyses, create EP concepts to mitigate Army AMD sensor, C2, and RF data link vulnerabilities.  (3) Develop EP tools for use by Army AMD systems to improve overall system performance in AEA environments.  (4) Develop effects-based AEA Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) to assess Army AMD EP concepts in Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) environment.  (5) Continue to collaborate with United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Joint Electromagnetic Preparedness for Advanced Combat (JEPAC) to evaluate, modify, and field existing Army AMD EP Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a Joint environment.  Evaluate and modify applicable Joint EP TTPs for use in Army AMD systems.  (6) Continually interface with intelligence communities to maintain cognizance of emerging AEA threats and incorporate these threats in future AEPE demonstrations.  (7) Develop a time-phased EP roadmap that identifies the investments needed to improve the EP capabilities of Army AMD sensors, C2, and RF data and voice networks.

The AEPE effort crosses all AMD System efforts of which only a portion is Air Defense Command and Control.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of Air and Missile Defense (AMD) operations at all echelons.  AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades, Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCT's), Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions/Corps.  AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities.  They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the AMD Battalions.  AMDPCS has three major components:  (1) The Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational three dimensional air picture.  AMDWS is the air picture provider for the Army, producing an integrated and correlated air picture at all tactical levels and locations.  AMDWS is also an integral component of Integrated Base Defense.  AMDWS provides an interoperability link to multinational air defense forces; (2) The Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is joint data link communications processor and display system that provides near-real time, three dimensional and joint airspace situational awareness for AMD forces; (3) The Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, Common Hardware Systems, standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions, direct forces, and manage airspace.  The integration of the Passive Identification, Friend or Foe (PIFF) capability into sheltered systems enables AMDPCS to track self-reporting aircraft.  PIFF receives position and identification data from self-reporting aircraft, to include UAS, within 250 nautical miles.  
 
$24.326M FY 2019 funds the development, software engineering, testing and certification of AMDWS and PIFF software; Engineering, development, test and evaluation of the AMDPCS Family of Shelter (FoS) subsystems; and Software system certification testing, accreditation, and approval of authority-to-operate (ATO).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy relies on non-development items (NDI) and evolutionary software development to rapidly meet the demands of air defense battle management command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (BM/C4I) requirements and to keep pace with automated information technologies.  The concept of evolutionary software development will be accomplished in a series of AMDWS Block releases and upgrades.  AMDPCS is being developed for both the Army's Active and Reserve components.

AMDWS software development is contracted Sole Source (SS)/Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) to Northrop Grumman.  PIFF development will be competitively awarded. 

AMDWS is a prime component of C-RAM.  It provides the Forward Operating Base (FOB) commander with clearance of fires display and enemy munitions flight paths.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system-of-systems (SoS) is an evolutionary, non-developmental program that detects RAM launches; provides localized warning to the defended area, with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercepts rounds in flight, thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhances response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors, command and control (C2) equipment, a commercial industry-produced warning system, and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)), all connected via a wireless local area network.  The Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, also under the management of the C-RAM Program Directorate, provides the C-RAM C2 functionality and has been enhanced to integrate the sensors, weapons, and warning systems for the C-RAM SoS.  C-RAM C2 software correlates RAM sensor data, evaluates the threat, provides early warning, directs engagements, and cues counterfire systems and reaction forces.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Egypt, providing correlated air and ground pictures to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Networks, and using various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information to synchronize and optimize automated Shape, Sense, Warn, Intercept, Respond, and Protect decisions.

The deployment of the C-RAM SoS was accomplished through an incremental acquisition process driven by urgent operational needs, theater priorities, and emerging capability requirements to provide a counter-RAM capability to combat forces.  The C-RAM SoS approach was initially validated by a Proof of Principle demonstration in December 2004 and has undergone more than 25 Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)-supported operational assessments to incorporate multiple improvements in response to changes in threat tactics and lessons learned.  C-RAM capabilities are currently deployed to locations in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS), Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), and Task Force Sinai (TFS).  Continuing C-RAM SoS improvement efforts, required to meet emerging theater requirements, include C2 and LPWS software upgrades as well as integration and deployment of Ku band Radio Frequency System (KuRFS) radars for an enhanced detection capability against stressing threats.  Base RDTE funding for FY 2015 and beyond supports maintenance of C-RAM C2 basic Air Defense functionality.  Support of the existing C-RAM SoS capability deployed in theater has been through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) process.
  
Recent directed enhancements to the C-RAM SoS capability included use of Army tactical communications rather than commercial systems; integration of Warn functionality into the C2 workstation to reduce complexity and footprint; and integration with Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) for enhanced situational awareness, combat identification, and response options.  Additional enhancements include testing and upgrade of dynamic clearance of unplanned fires (DCUF) in conjunction with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) V2 for rapid and enhanced response, integration of sensor communications and legacy systems, development and integration of C-RAM network security enhancements, and completion of an LPWS cruise missile capability study and modification development effort.

FY 2019 Base RDT&amp;E dollars in the amount of $1.846 million provide C-RAM C2 development and enhancements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C-RAM program is following an evolutionary acquisition strategy for rapid fielding of mature technology to the user.  The objective of the strategy is to balance needs, available technology, and resources to quickly provide a robust capability to engage RAM threats.  Both C-RAM Intercept (LPWS) and RAM Warn have transitioned to acquisition programs and continue to capitalize on RDTE investments (e.g., reuse/repurpose of Navy interceptor, Future Combat Systems (FCS) sensor technology development for Ku band Radio Frequency System (KuRFS) radar, etc.).  Development and upgrade of C-RAM C2 software, to include enhanced capability to support emerging Mission Command requirements, technology insertion, and interoperability, is accomplished through a five-year CPIF contract awarded in April 2015 to Northrop Grumman Mission Systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>For transparency and in support of the Counter Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS) Joint Operational Needs (JUON) CC-0558, Project FG5 was created in FY 2017 to support the identification, development, testing, evaluation and integration of technologies to provide an overall evolutionary capability to defeat small Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) threats.  The C-UAS effort will provide the capability for the warfighter to comprehensively detect, track, identify and defeat enemy Groups 1 and 2 light weight, low altitude Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UAS.  The C-UAS effort involves a phased development and testing approach to spiral capability into CENTCOM. The incremental approach provides interim standalone capability within the first few months and achieves a full networked capability by end of the JUON period.

FY 2019 Base dollars in the amount of $69.000 million and FY 2019 OCO dollars in the amount of $119.300 million provides improvement to previously fielded material solutions to enhance capability to detect, track, identify and defeat enemy Groups 1 and 2 light weight, low altitude COTS UAS. Efforts include development, integration, and testing of kinetic, or hard kill, defeat solutions into Low-slow-small UAS Integrated Defeat System (LIDS):  1) development of Coyote medium range seeker; 2) development of lightweight flat panel radar; 3) increase range of mobile gun weapon; and 4) development and integration of multi-function Electronic Warfare (EW) with full On-The-Move (OTM) capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In Phase 1a testing of mature solutions and down selecting was made for entry criteria in Phase 2 which will test fully networked, fixed/mobile capability, sustainable solution and deploy full capability to identified locations.  C-UAS is rapidly developing, integrating and deploying materiel solution through contracts awarded January 2017 to Syracuse Research Corporation (SRC) and June 2017 to DRS Sustainment Systems, Inc.

C-UAS will hold four distinct 1 month-long test events in FY19.  The events will test system of systems C-UAS approach resulting in four spiral hardware/software development efforts.  C-UAS improved capabilities will be delivered incrementally each quarter as they are ready for deployment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds the development of constructive and wargame simulations used to realistically train commanders and their battle staffs on today's complex battlefield conditions. 

Project 361 funds the development of the Intelligence Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT). IEWTPT is a Non-System Training Device (NTSD) which supports intelligence soldier readiness by simulating and stimulating Military Intelligence (MI) organic or surrogate equipment. It enables sustainment of critical individual and collective tasks/skills and is the core of the United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoEs) military Intelligence (MI) holistic training strategy and includes both stand-alone and network enabled training capabilities. IEWTPT provides a realistic Intelligence target environment for Multi-Intelligence disciplines such as All Source Analysis, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Counterintelligence (CI), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and must stimulate and emulate multiple Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platform systems such as: Prophet, Distributed Common Ground Station-Army (DCGS-A); Tactical Ground Station (TGS); and Aerial Intelligence assets such as Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced (ARL-E), and Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS). IEWTPT provides training capabilities supporting detailed ISR individual, crew, and collective level mission rehearsals/exercises. IEWTPT can utilize a constructive simulation feed or operate in a stand-alone mode. IEWTPT is composed of two major components: Technical Control Cell (TCC) and the HUMINT Control Cell (HCC). The IEWTPT TCC provides critical Intel enhancements to a constructive simulation to stimulate go-to-war or surrogate ISR systems where system operators/analysts are able to exploit exercise intelligence data during training, just as they would in a "real world" operation.

FY2019 funding supports U.S. Army readiness by developing interface capabilities with Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platform programs/systems of records to train detailed military intelligence mission essential tasks in a simulation environment.  The funds provide the development of web-enabled capabilities and common operating environment/computing environment (COE/CE) migration for Command Post, Sensor, and Cloud requirements for both Human Control Cell (HCC) and Technical Control Cell (TCC).

Project 362, Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) supports Army Title X training worldwide for Army Commanders and their staff at Mission Training Complexes (MTCs), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) facilities, and other customer locations. JLCCTC trains Commanders and their staff in Decisive Actions to include offensive, defensive, stability, and civil support operations. JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to Army Training Mission Area by providing appropriate levels of model and simulation resolution and fidelity to support unit collective and combined arms training. The JLCCTC provides a composable federation configurable to any combination of models and simulations, as required by training exercise intent/design. The JLCCTC provides accurate representations of tactically and operationally relevant land warfare operations executed in a contemporary Joint operating environment/context in support of Army Training and Readiness.

      FY 2019 funding in the amount of $9.047 million supports development, integration and test, and verification and validation activities of JLCCTC Version 9.0 of the Constructive Simulation Strategy implementation activities to train Commanders and their Staff.  This Constructive Simulation Strategy will merge software from two Federations (Multi-Resolution Federation used for Brigade/Division and above exercises and Entity Resolution Federation used for Brigade and below exercises)  into a single Federation solution.  JLCCTC will continue to support emerging Common Operating Environment / Computing Environment (COE/CE), Mission Command (MC), Information Assurance (IA), and Concurrency warfighter requirements.  In addition, JLCCTC will continue to support the integration activities with Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) and Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) to accomplish a Single Federation solution.  

      FY 2019 funding in the amount of $8.234 million supports JLCCTC mission command training program simulation upgrades. These upgrades will acquire the capabilities required (and identified by Division/Corps/Senior mentor) to properly replicate the operational environment in the simulation -- i.e. Aviation (Gray Eagle/Shadow/MUM-T); Electronic Warfare, Space, and Cyber.  Funding also ensures program remains federated with other Joint capabilities, especially with the Air Force.  These efforts will also support Combat Training Center (CTC) Enhancements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) supports Army Title X training worldwide for Army Commanders and their staff at Mission Training Complexes (MTCs), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) facilities, and other customer locations. JLCCTC trains Commanders and their staff in Decisive Actions to include offensive, defensive, stability, and civil support operations. JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to Army Training Mission Area by providing appropriate levels of modeling and simulation resolution and fidelity to support unit collective and combined arms training. JLCCTC provides a composable federation configurable to any combination of models and simulations, as required by training exercise intent/design. JLCCTC provides accurate representations of tactically and operationally relevant land warfare operations executed in a contemporary Joint operating environment/context and in support of Army Training and Readiness.

FY 2019 funding in the amount of $9,047 million supports development, integration and test, and verification and validation activities of JLCCTC Version 9.0 of the Constructive Simulation Strategy implementation activities to train Commanders and their Staff.  This Constructive Simulation Strategy will merge software from two Federations (Multi-Resolution Federation used for Brigade/Division and above exercises and Entity Resolution Federation used for Brigade and below exercises)  into a single Federation solution.  JLCCTC will continue to support emerging Common Operating Environment / Computing Environment (COE/CE), Mission Command (MC), Information Assurance (IA), and Concurrency warfighter requirements.  In addition, JLCCTC will continue to support the integration activities with Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) and Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) to accomplish a Single Federation solution.

FY 2019 funding in the amount of $8.234 million supports JLCCTC mission command training program simulation upgrades. These upgrades will acquire the capabilities required (and identified by Division/Corps/Senior mentor) to properly replicate the operational environment in the simulation -- i.e. Aviation (Gray Eagle/Shadow/MUM-T); Electronic Warfare, Space, and Cyber.  Funding also ensures program remains federated with other Joint capabilities, especially with the Air Force.  These efforts will also support Combat Training Center (CTC) Enhancements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides for development and testing of general-purpose test equipment, state-of-the-art diagnostics and prognostics technologies, and software and systems to support the increasingly complex electronic components of the Army's new and upgraded weapon systems.  It focuses on implementation of commercial test and diagnostic technologies across multiple weapon platforms to minimize the cost of troubleshooting and maintenance of Army equipment in the field.  

Modular, reconfigurable automatic and semi-automatic systems are being developed under this program to satisfy weapon system test and diagnostics requirements.  The Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS) provides state-of-the-art test and diagnostic capabilities to support current and future weapon systems.  It is the platform for transitioning Agile Rapid Global Combat Support System (ARGCS) technologies into the Army weapon system support structure, and it will replace several aging automatic test systems (ATS) that are becoming prohibitively expensive to operate and maintain.  

This PE also provides for continued development and improvement of general-purpose test equipment and calibration standards with emphasis on the incorporation of digital electronics and tailoring of configurations to improve deployability, mobility and survivability of the support equipment.  It includes development, demonstration and testing of calibration standards and techniques to support new Army test equipment requirements.  It provides for feasibility studies, market research, inventory analyses, bid sample testing and prototyping to support acquisition of calibration systems and general-purpose test and diagnostics equipment. 

FY 2019 Base funding for this PE continues incremental development of the Army's standard NGATS which will improve deployability and mobility of test and diagnostic equipment.  The NGATS provides state-of-the-art test and diagnostic capabilities and a means for reducing the Army's test equipment operating and support costs and the costs for supporting a number of the Army's vital warfighting systems.  The FY 2019 funding will develop or significantly modify test equipment to satisfy modular force and homeland security support requirements that cannot be accommodated with test equipment currently available in the commercial marketplace such as radio frequency (RF) and electro-optic (EO) testing capability.  It will also provide for technology enhancements to the Army's standard at-system tester to meet test and diagnostic requirements of the supported weapon systems, develop/redesign test program sets and hardware for support of legacy and emerging weapon systems, develop a network centric software framework for NGATS, and develop and test general-purpose test equipment and calibration standards to meet Army weapon system support requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of and system enhancements for the Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS) and the Maintenance Support Device (MSD).  The NGATS is a general-purpose automatic test system (ATS) that provides test and diagnostic capabilities required to support current and future weapons and combat support systems and will facilitate retirement of aging and obsolete test equipment that is imposing increasing logistics and operations and support cost burdens.  It is the platform for transitioning Agile Rapid Global Combat Support System (ARGCS) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) technologies into the Army weapon system support structure.  The ARGCS ACTD initiative was sponsored by the Department of Defense, and all Services are expected to transition demonstrated technologies into their ATS programs.  The MSD is the Army's standard at-system tester and requires continuing upgrades to support technology advancements in the supported weapon systems.  This Project funds development efforts to incorporate the most current relevant technology into the next generation MSD, supports capability enhancement of a wireless at-platform test set (WATS) connectivity, develops capabilities to minimize or eliminate Army dependency on expensive proprietary software to support tactical vehicles, and maintains compatibility with emerging platform hardware bus technology and software interface requirements.  This Project also provides for continuing efforts in the development and testing of common procedures utilizing existing test program sets and software applications, and market surveys of commercially available test equipment, methods and procedures to determine applicability to Army requirements.  The test and diagnostic systems and procedures developed under this Project are essential for ensuring the operational readiness, accuracy and effectiveness of the Army's warfighting systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This developmental Project consists of organic and contractual actions.  When the necessary expertise and capability are available within the Department of Defense, services required for the individual development projects are ordered from the government source; otherwise, commercial contracts are used.  Equipment required for developmental projects is obtained by contract from the commercial supplier.  Developmental efforts for the Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS) are being completed under a number of contracts awarded to the prime contractor for the Integrated Family of Test Equipment off-platform testers and other contractors with automatic test equipment (ATE) and test program set development capabilities.  NGATS is following an evolutionary acquisition strategy using incremental development to satisfy Army depot and field testing requirements for new and existing systems.  It will replace existing legacy Army ATE (i.e., Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF)(V)3, BSTF(V)5, and Direct Support Electrical System Test Set) as well as Army depot system-specific ATE.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports development and demonstration of state-of-the-art calibration standards and techniques, and it upgrades/improves existing Army calibration systems.  The Project provides feasibility studies, market research, inventory analyses, bid sample testing, and prototyping to support calibration systems and general-purpose test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) acquisitions.  Primary effort of this Project is development of calibration software; calibration capability for electro-optical, chemical, biological agent, radiation sourcing and detection systems, signal measurement and generation from direct current to microwave ranges, and physical and mechanical measurements such as torque, pressure and temperature; and improvements in test and measurement equipment performance envelopes.  This Project provides for product improvements and development/evaluation of advanced technologies to increase reliability of calibration systems and general-purpose TMDE.  The product improvements eliminate gaps in existing organic capabilities and ensure operational readiness, accuracy, effectiveness, and safety of Army weapons and combat support systems.  These improvements employ reconfigurable open-electronics architecture and computer-based instrumentation where feasible and focus on reduced test equipment footprint to improve deployability and mobility in areas of operation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The program element "Distributive Interactive Simulations - Engineering Development" applies to the Army's Advanced Simulation Program, which enables operational readiness and the development of concepts and systems for the Future Force through the application of new simulation technology and techniques.  The development and application of simulation technology will provide the means to link electronically a range of various simulation tools in a manner that is transparent to the user.  The amalgam of simulations and tools is linked together to enable execution of an event; to verify the scenarios, tactics/techniques and procedures; to train testers on new hardware/software; and to conduct trial test runs before costly live field tests.  The tools developed are available for reuse by developers and users of simulations throughout the Army.  

Project C74 funds the HQDA-chartered mission of the Simulation-to-Mission Command Interoperability (SIMCI) Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) in support of Army Training and Readiness. The SIMCI OIPT mission is to provide policy recommendations to Army senior leadership to improve organizations by allowing Soldiers to fight in the same manner in which they train. This is accomplished by interoperability between Mission Command (MC) systems and the Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) systems the Army uses to stimulate MC systems for training Soldiers and their Leaders. SIMCI also invests in targeted solutions to critical problem areas that exist between MC and Simulations. The SIMCI OIPT, led by Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (STRI) and PEO Command Control Communications-Tactical (C3T), uses focused collaborative processes among its 30+ Army organizations to identify key/critical interoperability shortfalls and the required materiel solutions.

Project C77, Army Geospatial Data Master Plan, focuses on activities that start with data acquisition from multiple sources and culminate in (1) accurate, robust and timely geospatial data and data management and (2) integration and conversion tools that support multiple battle command, training and mission-rehearsal applications. Project C77 continues development efforts associated with the Ground-Warfighter Geospatial Data Model (GGDM) and Geospatial Data Standards.

One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) Project C78 develops and delivers a software application that represents activities of units and forces in simulation to support Army Training and Readiness. The application is used by Army agencies to support the concept evaluation, experimentation, materiel acquisition and training throughout the communities.  The focus of this project is systems/software engineering and design for development and evolution of the architecture and software tools for a universal system of Army computer-generated forces -- OneSAF. OneSAF is a high fidelity brigade-and-below SAF that represents a full range of operations, systems and control processes in support of stand-alone and embedded training and Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) simulation applications. OneSAF is fully interoperable with the Army's emerging virtual, live, and division-and-above constructive simulations and provides next-generation simulation products. OneSAF replaces a variety of legacy simulations used within the Army to support analytic and training simulation activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The SIMCI OIPT provides the following: (1) Advisor to Army Leadership--improve MC and M&amp;S interoperability programs, policies, directives, resourcing, and procedures; (2) Technical Investment--sponsor/support initiatives that seek common solutions to critical interoperability issues surrounding MC and M&amp;S systems; (3) Outreach--conduct &amp; participate in interoperability outreach activities. SIMCI investments consist primarily of cost-sharing initiatives, leveraging initial system solutions of acquisition programs to enhance the interoperability of multiple systems in the Joint Operational Environment. SIMCI investments accelerate implementation within MC and M&amp;S systems, of common data models and information exchanges that are used by other Services and coalition nations, thus enhancing the inherent ability of Army systems to interoperate seamlessly in a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) environment.  

FY 2019 funding continues progress with embedding simulation into Mission Command Systems via the Ozone Widget Framework, continues management of the SIMCI OIPT's Army-wide collaborative, interoperability enhancement activities, including architecture alignment, data model alignment, common standards, components, and products. It is focused first on reducing costs and improving capabilities in the areas of automating Operational Plans, Orders, and Reports in support of Army, Joint, and Coalition operations.  Objectives are: identify and articulate to HQDA senior leadership specific standards that require Army-wide implementation; co-develop data standards, architecture standards, implementation specifications and Joint/Coalition products; continue transition of SIMCI knowledge and proof-of-principle products to Army and Joint acquisition programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Products developed transition to the lead or sponsor's program which then maintains the product for the cost savings of itself and other programs in both Communities.  The primary focus for these projects are the following:  Embedded simulations with current Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, gap-analysis for current simulations, and the proper implementation of Next-Generation modeling and simulation capabilities in regards to the Synthetic Training Environment (STE).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project C77 addresses the implementation and acceleration of objectives focused on geospatial standards that were identified in the Army Geospatial Data Integrated Master Plan (AGDIMP), approved by the Chief of Staff, Army in April 2005 and newer guidance and directives including the Army's Geospatial Information Office (GIO) GIO Charter, Army Regulation for Geospatial Information and Services updated in 2014 (AR 115-11), and Army COE (Common Operating Environment Implementation Plan's Geospatial Annex). The AGDIMP and the GIO charter, Geospatial Annex to COE IP, and AR 115-11 require the establishment of an enterprise architecture framed around geospatial standards that address geospatial/GEOINT data, services, and applications to enable the Army Geospatial Enterprise (AGE). This Army Geospatial Enterprise serves the Army's Programs/Systems, Organizations (most importantly our soldiers) to provide the geospatial foundation of accurate, robust, and timely geospatial data, robust tools and services that support mission command, intelligence, training, mission-rehearsal and other mission-applications. Project C77 addresses a geospatial/GeoINT standard-base framework that supports the ground-warfighter. This geospatial standard framework must also fit within the broader National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) and Allies Systems for GeoINT (ASG) architecture and standards.  The establishment of a ground-warfighter, standards-based framework support the management, dissemination, and update of geospatial data and services from National systems and organization to tactical systems and ground-warfighter in an enterprise fashion that will minimal translation into unique and often proprietary data formats and internal application databases.  

FY 2019 funding continues development efforts associated with the Ground-Warfighter Geospatial Data Model (GGDM) and integration of Geospatial Data Standards into the U.S. Army Geospatial Enterprise (AGE) and the Army M&amp;S Enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) develops and delivers a software application that represents activities of units and forces in simulation to support Army Training and Readiness. The application is used by Army agencies to support the concept evaluation, experimentation, materiel acquisition and training throughout the communities.  The focus of this project is systems/software engineering and design for development and evolution of the architecture and software tools for a universal system of Army computer-generated forces -- OneSAF. OneSAF is a high fidelity brigade-and-below SAF that represents a full range of operations, systems and control processes in support of stand-alone and embedded training and Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) simulation applications. OneSAF is fully interoperable with the Army's emerging virtual, live, and division-and-above constructive simulations and provides next-generation simulation products. OneSAF replaces a variety of legacy simulations used within the Army to support analytic and training simulation activities.  

FY 2019 funding allows for continued development of the software product line by addressing OneSAF Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3Is) as prioritized and approved by the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). This funding also provides for the management of the infrastructure, equipment, laboratories, and processes needed to develop, test, and release the required product baseline.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Continue the yearly release of the OneSAF Software (SW) versions containing performance enhancements resulting from the development and integration of both approved Product Improvements and integration of Co-Developer handovers. PM OneSAF continues to manage two Delivery Orders for the Development, Integration, Interoperability, and Support (I2S) of capabilities products, data, and documentation that fully serves the current and evolving needs of the user community.  

The enhancements will be executed within the development line as modifications to the released baseline via Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs); Change Requests (CRs): Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I); and correction of deficiencies identified as Problem Test Reports (PTRs) and Deficiency Reports (DRs) by the user community.

In FY2019, the program office is pursuing a single award contract for the continuing development and maintenance of the software baseline.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based, Combined Arms Training Strategy. The CATT program portfolio directly supports the Army's Training Strategy and progressive training model by providing realistic training events and comprehensive After Action Reviews (AAR). CATT enables units, from crew to the battalion task force level, to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic, interactive, synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and AAR for CATT expansions, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) supports combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, ground-air coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication, command, control, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT, units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises, as well as training tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment. Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions, CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces, CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training, and realistic simulation training in CATT, is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in combat operations.

FY 2019 base funding of $0.665 million for CCTT enables gaming technology and visualization for maneuver training, and the P3I for the CCTT in order to reduce life cycle costs.

FY 2019 base funding of $2.268 million for Games for Training will provide improved Government data rights and integration of an extended capability for the GFT software, Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3). These capabilities are to include, but not limited to, adding jamming and communications, close air support, and medical competencies. Additionally, funds will be used to conduct development and integration activities of the GFT system to ensure interoperability with Live, Virtual and Constructive training simulations and Mission Command Systems, and compliance with Risk Management Framework (RMF) requirements.

FY2019 base funding of $9.729 million for SE Core will continue the development of the Standard Terrain Generation Capability (STDGC) to ensure the process remains Army Geospatial Center (AGC) certified and that the correlated terrain databases maintain the "Gold Standard" quality rating and remain concurrent with supported training systems.  FY19 funds will continue developing and integrating the tools and process for constructive terrain database generation. Additionally, funds will be used to enhance subterranean and building interiors capabilities for incorporation into the STDGC baseline to provide interoperability across training simulators and simulations. SE Core will continue to enhance Virtual One Semi-Automated Forces (Virtual OneSAF) in the SE Core Architecture and develop, upgrade, integrate and refine the common visual models with FY19 funds.
  
FY 2019 base funding of $9.302 million for AVCATT will design and develop software to inter-operate with other training devices and simulators in a Common Operating Environment (COE).  This is required to enable training with the Universal Mission Simulator, CCTT, Games For Training, and LVC-IA.  Additionally, the base funding will be used to design and develop the replacement of the Image Generator system as part of hardware modernization.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Games for Training (GFT) Program prepares Soldiers and leaders for combined arms maneuver operations for Force 2025 and beyond in support of the Joint Force and allies with tailorable and scalable training and mission rehearsal capabilities. Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, groundair coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements. The GFT program satisfies the Active, the National Guard, and the Army Reserves' educational requirements in the Operational, Institutional, and Self-Development Training Domains with a low-overhead, flexible, persistent training capability on geo-specific and geo-typical terrain that is relevant with all military platforms and weapon systems. GFT comprehensively trains Company and below formations to operate in today's dynamic combat environment. GFT trains higher multi-echelon units and staffs without troops to meet Combatant Commanders' requirements.  

FY 2019 base funding of $2.268 million for Games for Training will provide improved Government data rights and integration of an extended capability for the GFT software, Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3). These capabilities are to include, but not limited to, adding jamming and communications, close air support, and medical competencies. Additionally, funds will be used to conduct development and integration activities of the GFT system to ensure interoperability with Live, Virtual and Constructive training simulations and Mission Command Systems, and compliance with Risk Management Framework (RMF) requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Additionally, OPA funding conducts the procurement and fielding of the Stryker Virtual Collective Trainers (SVCT), new gaming hardware suites, and gaming system refreshes. The GFT program will also provide other commercial and Government off the-shelf game software applications used to train Active, Reserve, and Army National Guard soldiers in a PC based, shared environment. OMA funding supports system monitoring of the Games for Training hardware and software configuration, in addition to funding Government program management, engineering and technical oversight for the GFT program.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy supports Army-wide gaming software for a commercial game based training system with government data rights, Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3), and associated Games for Training system hardware. The hardware consist of a common desktop or laptop computer, headset, and peripherals. In support of concurrency initiatives to the COTS solution, the GFT program conducts development and integration activities for new models and visual concurrency for the VBS3 software baseline.

In FY17, the government awarded a firm-fixed price contract for concurrency of the VBS3 software, to include commercial software updates, and technical support for the VBS3 suite of products. Additionally, the government plans to procure VBS3 training support as well as commercial VBS3 software data rights to provide areas of training competency such as engineering tasks, call for fire, and the generation of supporting 3D models. The contract was awarded June 2017 with one base year and four (4) one year option periods.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) Program.  The Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) Program is a foundational element and the only provider of correlated terrain for the Army's Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE) that links Army training systems and simulators into an integrated and interoperable environment.  SE Core's mission is to ensure that Army systems and simulators support U.S. Army Readiness by providing visual models (buildings and vehicles), terrain (over which the simulator moves), and entity behaviors (models performing realistic and appropriate actions such as movement and weapon effects) that are relevant and realistic to Force 2025 and beyond.  As the exclusive provider of correlated terrain, SE Core ensures that all Army simulators/operators receive terrain that allows for a "Fair Fight" capability; that is, no one will have an inherent advantage over another because training did not occur on a "level playing field".  Fair Fight allows air and ground forces to hold coordinated and integrated training events that accurately replicate combat operations for a train-as-we-fight capability.  

A major component of the program is the SE Core-developed Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC), the process used to build the terrain and models that the simulators and simulations employ.  The Army Geospatial Center (AGC) gave SE Core its highest rating, the "Gold Standard", based on the quality of the STDGC process and the geospatial data generated by it.  The program has been a certified, AGC co-producer of geospatial data since 2014.  In addition to the correlated terrain databases and common visual models, SE Core components include Virtual One Semi-Automated Forces (Virtual OneSAF) (the computer generated force behaviors for virtual systems); the virtual systems architecture; and mission command development. 

FY2019 base funding of $9.729 million for SE Core will continue the development of the STDGC terrain generation capability to ensure the process remains AGC certified and that the correlated terrain databases maintain the "Gold Standard" quality rating and remain concurrent with supported training systems.  FY19 funds will continue developing and integrating the tools and process for constructive terrain database generation. Additionally, funds will be used to enhance subterranean and building interiors capabilities for incorporation into the STDGC baseline to provide interoperability across training simulators and simulations. SE Core will continue to enhance Virtual OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture and develop, upgrade, integrate and refine the common visual models with FY19 funds.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SE Core program is post Milestone B and will remain in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase for the remainder of its lifecycle.  SE Core is a "software only" program that continuously develops terrain, virtual models and other software products for integration into existing training systems. It does not field products to the end user, therefore the program will not require a Milestone C decision or go into the Production phase. The SE Core program is developing the software tools and processes to develop the Army's common virtual environment to link simulation devices [to include: Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), Aviation Close Combat tactical Trainer (AVCATT) , Games for Training (GFT), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Homestation Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC), Fires Simulation (FIRESIM), One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF)] into an interoperable environment and maintaining the synthetic terrain, models, and virtual OneSAF for the Army's Integrated Training Environment (ITE) concept. 

The government awarded Increment 2 as a single award, cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Leidos in August 2011 with a period of performance start date of December 2011. Leidos was formerly known as Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  This contract has a one-year base with four one-year options.  The government exercised the first option in December 2012, the second option in December 2013, the third option in December 2014 and the fourth option in December 2015. The government awarded a final delivery order in December 2016 that extended the period of performance of the Increment 2 contract into December 2017.

In keeping with the original SE Core acquisition strategy of continuous development, the government intends to award the Increment 3 contract as a single award, CPFF, IDIQ contract in FY18. Increment 3, which will add the Dense Urban Terrain requirements, additional systems and formats, will align with the contract period of performance. The contract will have a one year base and four one-year options with a target end date of 2022.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) is Army Aviation's only Collective Training Program of Record for Active, Reserve, and Army National Guard Aviation Units.  AVCATT enables unit collective and combined arms air-ground training for AH-64, UH-60, CH-47, and UH-72 aircrews within the Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) Integrated Training Environment (ITE). The AVCATT also supports the training of Non-Rated crew members in crew coordination, flight, aerial gunnery, hoist, and slingload related tasks via the Non-Rated Crew Member Manned Module (NCM3); which can be linked to AVCATT's UH-60, CH-47, and UH-72 cockpit configurations to support a unit's specific Mission Training Requirements.   

FY2019 base funding of $9.302M for AVCATT will design and develop software to inter-operate with other training devices and simulators in a Common Operating Environment (COE).  This is required to enable training with the Universal Mission Simulator, Close Combat Tactical Trainers (CCTT), Games For Training, and LVC-IA.  Additionally, the base funding will be used to design and develop the replacement of the Image Generator system as part of hardware modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The government awarded a single award, cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Applied Visual Technologies, a minority owned, small disadvantaged business, in December 2012. The period of performance of the base contract is through December 2017. Additional tasks are exercised through delivery orders which each have multiple options for development. The most recently awarded RDTE effort was on the fourth delivery order, awarded in September 2014, which included options for gunnery enhancements, integrated data modem development, training environment virtualization, aviation mission planning software development, maintenance tool kit development, manned unmanned teaming, and AH-64E concurrency development.

The government awarded a single award, CPFF, IDIQ services contract to Cole Engineering Services, Inc, a small business, in September 2015.  The period of performance of the base contract is through September 2020.   The third task order, awarded in June 2016, included hardware modernization development and Windows 10 research and testing.  

AVCATT utilizes small business competitively awarded contract vehicles when able. Currently small businesses are conducting development for dynamic terrain enhancements, NCM3 development, and training effectiveness analysis.

The AVCATT program is post Milestone C. Although the system is in the production phase, continuous research, development, testing, and engineering is required in order to maintain concurrency with the real world aircraft and systems that the AVCATT simulates in the virtual training environment. The AVCATT program has fielded the full base order of issue of 23 suites but continues to release incremental hardware and software upgrades at approximate semiannual intervals.  RDTE efforts will conclude in FY21, as system begins its transition into sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project FG7 Emerging Technology Initiatives was created in support of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO). This project was realigned to PE 0605054A Emerging Technologies Initiatives in FY 2019 for greater transparency of the Army RCO efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is comprised of five projects: Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) Test and Evaluation; Production/Field Coordination for Capability Sets; Army Systems Engineering, Architecture &amp; Analysis; Army Integration Management &amp; Coordination; and Emerging Technology Initiatives. The specific evaluation requirements will support Mission Command Network 2020, Force 2025 objectives, and emerging technology insertion.

Project DY3: Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) Test &amp; Evaluation, synchronizes, integrates, and manages system and System of Systems (SoS) network capability evaluations in laboratory and operational environments in order to inform Army force modernization decisions that impact network improvements, interoperability compliance, operational readiness, and exploitable technology opportunities.

Project DY5: Production/Fielding Coordination for Capability Sets, provides for the development of a synchronized Brigade/Division level plan for the Production equipment delivery and Fielding (hand-off logistics and new equipment training) of Capability Set (CS) components (both hardware/software in A and/or B Kits) upon completion of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Army CS fielding decision.

Project DY7: Army System Engineering, Architecture &amp; Analysis, provides the Army's leadership and materiel developers with the necessary modernization planning, System of Systems (SoS) engineering, technical analysis, architectural products, critical path analysis, and risk analysis and mitigation planning to influence the Army's materiel portfolio. This project also explicitly funds Cyber Security engineering, architecture and development tasks necessary to create effective, affordable and secure network capabilities that address critical gaps, meet Mission Command Network (MCN) 2020 objectives and/or Force 2025 and Beyond (F2025B) initiatives. Integration of Army defensive/offensive cyber and Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities into the overall CS design, Multinational/Mission Partner Environments architecture development at both the tactical and enterprise levels, network modernization risks/gaps for Corps level units and below, and Army spectrum strategy.

Project DZ6: Army Integration Management &amp; Coordination, provides for all "shared" functions (Human resources, Budget development and executions, Acquisition, Operations, Program Coordination, Facilities management) and headquarters functions that supports the technical aspects of the Network integration, Platform integration, Brigade Integration and the Production Integration and coordination and synchronized fielding teams.

Project FG7: Emerging Technology Initiatives, will fund prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to defeat emerging threats against ground, aviation, command, control, communications &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment, precision weapons, and Soldier equipment. Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of emerging technologies and systems in relevant varied environments and tactical/operational scenarios. The focus is to mature technologies with a goal of initial production, limited fielding, and transition to a Program of Record in an Army or DoD Program Management Office.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project DY3: Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) Test &amp; Evaluation, synchronizes, integrates, and manages system and System of Systems (SoS) capability assessments in laboratory and operational environments in order to inform Army force modernization decisions that impact system improvements, interoperability compliance, operational readiness, and exploitable technology opportunities.

In FY2018 there are two planned events: a NIE and a Joint Warfighting Assessment (JWA) [formerly known as an Army Warfighting Assessment (AWA)]. The NIE will focus on testing of Programs of Record (PoR) in support of synchronized Capability Set (CS) fielding of network and mission command systems. The JWA will focus on Force 2025 concepts; interoperability &amp; Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs); and emerging capabilities.  Beginning in FY2019, in accordance with readiness demands and the Army's new modernization approach, the mission will shift to only support Warfighter Assessment events with focus on Joint Multination Interoperability and concept development. This change will affect associated integration and management processes by reducing the formal rigor associated with PoR testing and shifting to an experimentation model, with prototype-level designs and increased unit ownership of preparation tasks.

These funds support the following major efforts associated with an assessment:
- Planning: coordination with multiple stakeholders on the participation and resourcing of personnel, services, equipment and prototypes, and other deliverables needed for lab based risk reduction (LBRR), capability and platform integration, training, field support and logistics, event battle rhythm/schedule, and developing network data products. 
- Preparation: Conduct LBRR, complete integrated vehicle designs, build prototype vehicles for safety release, conduct platform installation and checkout, validate the network, and obtain Information Assurance certifications.
- Execution: technical and logistics support during soldier-led assessments, trouble ticket management and closeout, and field support management.
- Close-out: inventorying platforms, de-installing equipment, returning platforms to their original configurations.

These funds may also be used for procuring equipment and materials (to include prototypes, when required), event infrastructure, field services, personnel (government and contractor), and travel.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Overview:
These funds provide for Close out of NIE 18.2; Planning, Preparation, Execution, and Close-out for JWA 19; and initial planning for JWA 20. Planning and Preparation are expected to occur at Ft Bliss, TX, while, Execution and Close-out are expected to occur at various locations such as the unit?s home station or a Combined Arms Training Center. 

Planning:
These funds support the development and implementation of horse blanket architecture, conducting design activities for integration of capability onto unit vehicles, exercise planning and coordination, to include:
Developing a Validation Exercise (VALEX) plan that configures and checks out the system of systems prior to the exercise; assigning unit locations within the VALEX location; identifying and resolving security issues associated with running classified and/or coalition network operations; validating all Information Assurance Accreditations for networked C4ISR systems, and developing of technical mission threads used to validate the capabilities.
These funds also support defining the network system configurations and routing schemes for each event. 

Preparation: 
These funds support efforts leading up to the execution of the assessment exercise, to include LBRR, vehicle integration design and build, safety release, and conducting of VALEX. 
The LBRR risk reduction efforts are conducted in controlled laboratory environments to identify and resolve integration, configuration and interoperability issues prior to assessments. Reports delivered by the LBRR document the results of network functional testing, routing, and thread testing.
These funds provide for integration efforts such as design of installation kits on tactical platforms; fabrication of specialized cables, metal plates, racks, and brackets to enable platform installation/integration; and safety release testing.  The scope of the integration effort also includes planning for Field Service Representatives (FSRs) and other technical support personnel, coordination and movement of the Fleet vehicles, and inventory management of systems.
Following completion of platform integration efforts, these funds support a structured network VALEX consisting of four subordinate efforts: Load Exercise (LOADEX), ESTABLISH, INTEGRATE, and VALIDATE. 
-LOADEX; Support unit installation of new network capabilities into existing network, to include setting Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and configure network systems changes; modify radio mission plans, system configuration files and system parameters; and perform test/fix/test processes at the system and component levels.
-ESTABLISH; Verification of new hardware and software performance at the platform level. Troubleshoot issues associated with network system configurations and verify that each integrated platform can perform its mission while operating on the network.
-INTEGRATE; Verification of networked related hardware/software performance and networked communications at each echelon. Troubleshoot issues found with new capabilities and ensure tactical unit information exchange will enable units to support their intended missions. 
-VALIDATE; Support unit conduct of mission threads to verify the correct routing of messages and information transfer among critical nodes in the network. 

Execution:
Funding supports all management and synchronization of field operations and support personnel during the events, and coordination with the supported command. It also includes monitoring of network operations in the field, trouble ticket management, continued LBRR support to troubleshoot technical issues, deployment of mobile facilities, and replacement parts/components required to effectively support concepts and capabilities under assessment.

Closeout:
These funds support all activities associated with the de-installation and recovery of systems, components, A-kits, cabling installed on platforms, and restoration of platforms to baseline configurations.  Removal, inspection, repair/replacement, shipping, and storing of all materiel and infrastructure used to enable the unit to execute the event.  Conduct AARs for process improvements.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development of a synchronized Brigade/Division level plan for the Production equipment delivery and Fielding (hand-off logistics and new equipment training) of Capability Set (CS) components (both hardware/software in A and/or B Kits) upon completion of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Army CS fielding decision.
This project includes the following efforts: Oversight and direct coordination between participating Program Executive Offices (PEOs), Program Managers (PMs), Research, Development and Engineering Commands (RDECOMs) and the Army's Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) throughout the CS Vehicle Integration and Synchronized Fielding process to ensure that a CS package is received, integrated, trained, and handed-off to the unit in a synchronized and efficient manner. Identification and assessment of available capabilities for inclusion into a CS. Alignment of the CS requirements with the appropriate Programs of Record (PoR) and the recipient unit to define the unit's Network Basis of Issue (NBOI)/ Architecture by type of BCT. Coordination with PEOs, PMs, Army G-staff to ensure CS products are Materiel Released/Type Classified, fully resourced and synchronized by a single Integrated Master Schedule for design integration, testing, production, kitting, platform integration, training and fielding. Direct support during each of the unit's "New Equipment Training" and "New Equipment Fielding", along with the preparation for the BCT's rotation through one of the Army's Combat Training Centers, (Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) or National Training Center (NTC)). Ensuring that all training assets are reset and moved to the follow-on BCT. Manage all After Action activities.

This project does not fund the actual production, integration, nor fielding costs associated with the CS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

*Project FG7 Emerging Technology Initiatives was created in support of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO). This project was realigned to PE0605054A Emerging Technologies Initiatives in FY2019 for greater transparency of the Army RCO efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced Soldier, ground, aviation, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence &amp; Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems and equipment.
The Primary goal is to take technologies to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 and 8 through a collaborative and accelerated acquisition process. Technologies will be demonstrated in relevant environments, performing tactical/operational scenarios. Efforts will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability within one to five years. Efforts will include accelerated material development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs in Cyber; Electronic Warfare (EW); Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Survivability and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical Program of Record capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements, and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.
The Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders' needs. The Army RCO was established per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT: Establishment of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, signed by the Secretary of the Army: Eric K. Fanning, dated 11 August 2016.
The RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally. Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.   

The RCO capabilities focus areas are:
Cyber
Electronic Warfare (EW)
Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT)
Survivability
Operational Needs Statements (ONS)
Any other operational needs that become a priority as designated by the Army Board of Directors (BOD)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort selects technologies that show high promise for advancing and accelerating capabilities required under acquisition programs and develops and evaluates associated prototypes for accelerated identification, assessment, and transition to an acquisition program for production and fielding. It also demonstrates integrated technologies within a high fidelity and realistic operating environment and transitions them to a formal program of record on an accelerated basis. This effort also includes analysis, integration and evaluation of emerging capabilities on air and ground platforms to reduce risk and support technology insertions.</r2:Description>

Electronic Warfare Phase 1 Requirements (In support of USAREUR ONS ? 16-21509) - will integrate and assess Ground EW capability with enhanced and networked Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT) Thick Client, Prophet, and Versatile Radio Observation &amp; Direction Finding (VROD) / Modular Adaptive Transmitter (VMAX). In addition, the FY17 requirement will demonstrate EW modules for Integrated Sensor Architecture (ISA).

Electronic Warfare Phase 2 Requirements (In support of USAREUR ONS ? 16-21509) - will initiate integration and assessment of air EW capability. Funding will acquire long lead prototypes, conduct non-recurring integration engineering and risk reduction exercises, and enable further development of ground EW prototype capabilities.

Positioning, Navigation and Timing Phase 1 Requirements (In support of USAREUR ONS ? 16-21509) - will integrate and assess the DAGR Distributed Device Enhancement (D3E) w/Anti-Jam (AJ) Antenna and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Sensors to participate in the Joint Warfighting Assessment (JWA) 18.1. Non-recurring engineering and integration of the D3E/AJ onto the Bradley, Abrams, Stryker and Paladin platforms is required in FY18 to obtain a Capabilities and Limitations (C&amp;L) report to enable Urgent Materiel Release (UMR).</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army RCO capitalizes on current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to address emerging threats and high impact capability opportunities of U.S. Army Forces deployed globally. This is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and 2) developing emerging deployable capability through research and development organizations, academia, and industry. The RCO uses streamlined acquisition methods, processes and techniques to rapidly acquire capability; these methods vary by project. The Rapid Capabilities Office will have a dedicated contracting staff, with the flexibility to use both traditional and non-traditional contracting approaches. To reach non-traditional vendors, RCO will use non-standard contracting methods, such as Other Transaction Authority instruments. Where practicable, prototypes will be acquired using competitive procedures. Projects will be transitioned to an approved acquisition program for production and sustainment. Operational assessments will be conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation, prototype maturation, and future capability development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

In FY 2019, PE 0603639A, Project EU1, Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions will transition to PE 0604802A, Project EU6, 155mm High Explosive Extended Range Artillery.  This Project is not a New Start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds multiple efforts for engineering development of weapons and munitions systems.

Project 613: This Project supports both the High Explosive Guided Mortar (HEGM) and the Weaponized Universal Lightweight Fire-control (WULF). 

The High Explosive Guided Mortar (HEGM) project funds engineering development of precision guidance systems applicable to Indirect Fire mortar weapon systems. HEGM provides a precision capability to support the close fight in urban and complex terrain, while at the same time, reducing collateral damage. HEGM provides precision accuracy and effectiveness for 120mm mortar systems using precision guidance systems that will effectively reduce target delivery error. The HEGM capability will be developed through the use of improved guidance and control components and advanced airframe design that allow sufficient maneuver of the cartridge in flight to correct for induced error providing the ability to engage targets without the need to adjust fire.

The Weaponized Universal Lightweight Fire-control (WULF) project funds engineering development of fire-control systems applicable to Indirect Fire mortar weapon systems. WULF is a digital sight integrated with digital fire-control that is designed for aiming of the M252 81mm mortar system and other man portable mortar systems (60mm and 120mm). The digital sight unit and Fire Control will allow the Soldier to emplace the mortar systems faster and fire more accurately. WULF will improve the accuracy of the M252 mortar.

Project EC4: This project will standardize various pyrotechnic that simulate battlefield effects. The Army's Combat Training Centers (CTCs) are currently using non-standard munitions to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield effects. These modified commercial-off-the-shelf products have not been type classified, material released, and are not safe or sustainable for use by Soldiers. This effort will develop and demonstrate various pyrotechnics/simulators to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield affects such as: Black smoke signature (burning vehicles, buildings, and equipment); Yellow smoke signature (chemical, biological or nuclear effects); Macro pyrotechnics to simulate hostile fire and small Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during mounted operations in urban terrain; Micro pyrotechnics to simulate indoor hostile fire and IED effects that are capable of being integrated into existing facilities; Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) on a wire to replicate the flight of a Rocket Propelled Grenade; High Order Blast Effect (HOBE) used to replicate a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED), building explosions, and other significant explosive events; Artillery airburst (LA45) simulator to replicate indirect fire; simulator to replicate a STINGER (LA47) firing; Tracer Fire-back simulator to replicate enemy small arms fire and anti-aircraft fire. Standardization will reduce training costs, eliminate redundancies between systems, mitigate environmental concerns and safety risks associated with realistic scenario based training.

Project ED7: The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank. AMP has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay, and airburst. AMP is the materiel solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition. In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles. The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015. FY 2019 will support the continuation of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase 2 and transition into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). This includes the completion of the Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) cartridge build, initiation and completion of DT&amp;E, and Milestone C. Continue to evaluate the scalability for future combat platforms. Conduct fuze risk reduction effort with potential second source supplier. Demonstrate feasibility of a training round for AMP.

Project EL9: This project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. FY 2019 funding will be used to integrate the munitions health monitoring system and continue to integrate passive time/temperature exposure sensors with additional developmental ammunition items and conduct qualification tests for both.

Project EP3: The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. FY 2019 funding will support Milestone (MS) B activities to include Request for Proposal (RFP), Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Contract Award for the 7.62mm caliber variant. Funding will also explore lessons learned from the Marine Corp .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort and other various options to satisfy the .50 Caliber reduced range requirement.

Project EP4: The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 Caliber Munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. OWL projects objective is to develop and field a full day/night tracer round, replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability. 7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm OWL cartridges and later followed by .50 Caliber cartridges. FY 2019 funding will support post Milestone B (MS B) activities to include Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Design Verification Testing (DVT), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and a User Assessment (UA) for the 7.62mm caliber ammunition.

Project EP5: This project supports both the Advanced Armor-Piercing ammunition and the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) Family of Ammunition.

Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP): The ADVAP project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158. The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) both 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge for the M240 machine gun and ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm. The objective is to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges. FY 2019 funding supports continuation of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts and activities to accelerate the project.

Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) Family of Ammunition: The NGSW ammo is a new ammunition technology under development for use in the Next Generation Squad Weapon systems. The objective is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) the new ammunition. FY 2019 funding supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts and activities to accelerate the project for the Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) variant and the Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) variant. Follow-on development efforts for additional NGSW ammunition variants including tracer ammunition, blank ammunition, and reduced range ammunition will start in FY 2022.

Project EP7: This project will support Integrated System Design (ISD), System Capability (SC) and Manufacturing Process Demonstrations (MPD) on current pyrotechnic munitions and tunable pyrotechnic aircraft counter measures and decoys. The project will also support ISD, SC and MPD on new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided missile threats. Activities include modeling and simulation, flight testing, qualification testing, engineering to reduce size and weight, environmental considerations, safety enhancements, manufacturing enhancements, qualification of other service and foreign munitions that could meet current requirements, product improvements, insertion of new technologies to increase performance, and enhancement of current flare solutions for new and existing aircraft. Systems include impulse cartridges, pen flares, hand held signals, trip flares, simulators, marine markers, smoke pots, smoke grenades, rail road flares and other type of emergency/distress devices, aircraft expendables (to include Radio Frequency (RF) expendables), and primers used in munitions systems.

Project EU4: 40mm Improved High Explosive Dual Purpose (I-HEDP) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the 40mm High Velocity I-HEDP Capability Development Document (CDD). The I-HEDP tactical cartridge provides the warfighter with the ability to achieve the required lethal effects against enemy personnel in the open and to defeat personnel targets in defilade position. Additionally, the I-HEDP cartridge will be able to defeat unarmored and lightly armored vehicles. FY 2019 funding supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities including source selection, contract award, Design Engineering Tests (DET), and technical design.

Project EU6: The 155mm High Explosive Extended Range Artillery Projectile project will evaluate, develop and qualify extended range technologies, including the XM1113 in 39 caliber weapon systems with legacy propellants. The XM113 effort is a government owned materiel solution for long-range cannon artillery projectile that will increase range by 10km+ in 39 caliber weapon systems, and contain twice as much rocket motor grains as the current 155mm long range cannon projectile that is now obsolete. The XM1113 will leverage enhanced lethality cannon munition technologies to compensate for increased rocket motor volume. This design will utilize a high fragmentation steel body with a streamlined ogive and a high performance rocket motor. The projectile body is filled with an insensitive munition (IM) high explosive (HE) and a supplementary charge. FY 2019 will support the completion of the Developmental Test phase of Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) and the completion of the Critical Design Review (CDR) in 4Q FY 2019.

Project EU7: The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) project will accelerate the qualification of Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT) on the 155mm XM1128 high explosive projectile, per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition 22 December 2016. The project addresses requirements for increased lethality of 155mm high explosive unitary projectiles (Initial Draft Requirements for the XM1128 with Lithographic Fragmentation Technology, 24 February 2017). The ELCM project will also evaluate, develop and qualify new lethality technologies for 155mm cannon artillery munitions and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to production. The ELCM project will support testing of the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Systems M999 advanced cluster munition, per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition 22 December 2016. The project will complete a lethality arena test on the M999 submunitions to be conducted at the IMI facility in Israel. FY 2019 will support the completion of the Product Qualification Testing (PQT) test series for the XM1128 and the finalization of the Capability Production Document (CPD) by 4Q FY 2019.

Project EU8: The Improved Multi-Option Fuze project will integrate the results of Budget Activity 04, Program Element 0603639A, Project EU2 and qualify/Type Classify (TC) new improved Multi-Option Fuzes (iMOFA/iMOFM) with Government-owned Next Generation Proximity Sensor (NGPS) capabilities containing built-in exportability attributes previously matured via OSD-sponsored tech base efforts under the Joint Fuze Technology Program and Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Congressional Pilot Program. Continuing FMS sales of non-precision artillery and mortar ammunition fuzes containing proximity technology will increase the incidence of reverse engineering (RE) and threat of electronic countermeasures (ECM). If realized, these threats will negate the current battlefield advantages of U.S. troops. The pending policy-driven loss of Cannon DPICM will further increase the importance of NGPS / Height of Burst (HoB) fuzing capabilities to efficiently engage enemy target sets. This Project will develop and qualify safe, affordable, reliable Proximity/HoB fuzing solution for non-precision Cannon artillery and Mortar munitions that are resistant to adversary exploitation via ECM and RE threats.

Project EW1: High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The 40mm LV HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to engage targets at increased effective ranges using the 40mm M203/M320 Grenade Launcher. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased effective ranges with greater accuracy and lethality. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge. The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability. FY 2019 supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort for competing prototypes and continues EMD design activities.

The 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Door Breach (DB), XM1167, cartridge allows the grenadier to conduct a ballistic breach of an existing door creating an entry point into a building or other structure. This capability is critical during Urban Operations, while having stand-off ability to conduct ballistic breach at ranges up to 50 meters away, with a single-shot, and without pause between actual breach and entry of initial force. The 40mm DB cartridge will provide the small unit with the capability to conduct breaching operations; allowing the Warfighter to create an entry point in a structure allowing an assault element to enter and begin clearing operations, which is the most difficult type of operation that Soldiers may face in an urban environment. The 40mm DB cartridge will reduce collateral damage and friendly casualties associated with breaching operations. The deployment of 40mm DB cartridges will enable the small unit to gain and maintain a tactical advantage through efficiency of combat power and momentum. FY 2019 supports Design Engineering Testing (DET) and Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E).

Project FA6: The 30mm Lethality Project funds development of a suite of 30x173mm caliber cartridges, which includes anti-personnel tactical and training cartridges and anti-materiel tactical and training cartridges. The objective is to enhance the operational effectiveness and lethality of the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) and any Army Fighting Vehicles that are equipped with a 30x173mm weapon system. The tactical cartridges will provide an organic direct fire capability to support infantry at a greater range and will improve lethality when engaging dismounted infantry and like armored vehicles. The training cartridges will be ballistically matched to the tactical cartridges, allowing the Warfighter to train in a cost effective manner. This Project will leverage earlier efforts in support of the Stryker Operational Needs Statement for Increased Lethality. FY 2019 funding will continue to support the ammunition qualification activities and development of performance specifications in support of the 30x173mm Programmable Airburst Munitions - Tracer (PABM-T) Urgent Materiel Release (UMR). FY 2019 effort also includes activities for developing/qualifying a 30x173mm Programmable Airburst Munition (PABM) along with an initial Design Engineering Test (DET). The objective is to field airburst capable 30x173mm cartridges and programming/communication units for use in Stryker ICV and/or Army Future Fighting Vehicles.

Project S36: The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a course correcting fuze that provides near precision accuracy and efficiency for current and future155mm High Explosive (HE) projectiles by eliminating a portion of the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions which effectively reduces the number of projectiles required to execute fire missions. PGK utilizes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and internal Guidance and Navigation Computer to accomplish its mission with point detonating and height of burst fuzing functions. The PGK M1156E1 effort will incorporate and qualify state of the art technologies to increase the functionality of PGK in GPS degraded environments as well as compatibility with the Army's new long range cannon and projectiles which will be fielded during the PGK Life Cycle.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The High Explosive Guided Mortar (HEGM) project funds engineering development of precision guidance systems applicable to Indirect Fire mortar weapon systems.  HEGM provides a precision capability to support the close fight in urban and complex terrain, while at the same time, reducing collateral damage.  HEGM provides precision accuracy and effectiveness for 120mm mortar systems using precision guidance systems that will effectively reduce target delivery error.  The HEGM capability will be developed through the use of improved guidance and control components and advanced airframe design that allow sufficient maneuver of the cartridge in flight to correct for induced error providing the ability to engage targets without the need to adjust fire.

The Weaponized Universal Lightweight Fire-control (WULF) project funds engineering development of fire-control systems applicable to Indirect Fire mortar weapon systems. WULF is a digital sight integrated with digital fire-control that is designed for aiming of the M252 81mm mortar system and other man portable mortar systems (60mm and 120mm).  The digital sight unit and Fire Control will allow the Soldier to emplace the mortar systems faster and fire more accurately.  WULF will improve the accuracy of the M252 mortar.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>HEGM - The Acquisition Strategy was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in 2Q FY 2017. HEGM will be procured using a Performance Specification (P-Spec).  The strategy will use a DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) initiative and a Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) contract. The DOTC OTA initiative resulted in multiple awards to cover the Preliminary Design Phase requirements for FY 2017. A single Full and Open FAR contract is anticipated to be awarded for the completion of EMD, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and first 3 years of Full Rate Production (FRP). 

WULF - Was developed under the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Science &amp; Technology initiative and currently assessed at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 maturity (prototype demonstrated in a relevant environment).  An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was approved in 3Q FY 2017 by PEO Ammunition.  The project is managed as a Modification Work Order (MWO) to M252A1 with a tailored Acquisition Strategy, leveraging existing FIRECON-F and/or DOTC contract to multiple vendors.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project will standardize various pyrotechnic that simulate battlefield effects.  The Army's Combat Training Centers (CTCs) are currently using non-standard munitions to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield effects.  These modified commercial-off-the-shelf products have not been type classified, material released, and are not safe or sustainable for use by Soldiers.  This effort will develop and demonstrate various pyrotechnics/simulators to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield affects such as:  Black smoke signature (burning vehicles, buildings, and equipment); Yellow smoke signature (chemical, biological or nuclear effects); Macro pyrotechnics to simulate hostile fire and small Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during mounted operations in urban terrain; Micro pyrotechnics to simulate indoor hostile fire and IED effects that are capable of being integrated into existing facilities; Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) on a wire to replicate the flight of a Rocket Propelled Grenade; High Order Blast Effect (HOBE) used to replicate a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED), building explosions, and other significant explosive events; Artillery airburst (LA45) simulator to replicate indirect fire; simulator to replicate a STINGER (LA47) firing; Tracer Fire-back simulator to replicate enemy small arms fire and anti-aircraft fire.  Standardization will reduce training costs, eliminate redundancies between systems, mitigate environmental concerns and safety risks associated with realistic scenario based training.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  AMP has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay, and airburst.  AMP is the materiel solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015. FY 2019 will support the continuation of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase 2 and transition into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  This includes the completion of the Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) cartridge build, initiation and completion of DT&amp;E, and Milestone C.  Continue to evaluate the scalability for future combat platforms.  Conduct fuze risk reduction effort with potential second source supplier.  Demonstrate feasibility of a training round for AMP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  FY19 funding will be used to integrate the munitions health monitoring system and continue to integrate passive time/temperature exposure sensors with additional developmental ammunition items and conduct qualification tests for both.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

PE 0604802A, Project EP3, RRA funding continues the development work of 7.62mm and supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2019. The project is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions.  The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas.  RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ.  This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges.  The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns.  FY 2019 funding will support Milestone (MS) B activities to include Request for Proposal (RFP), Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Contract Award for the 7.62mm caliber variant.  Funding will also explore lessons learned from the Marine Corp .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort and other various options to satisfy the .50 Caliber reduced range requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber One Way Luminescence (OWL) technology applies to multiple calibers. In FY 2018, the 7.62mm variant transitions from Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EB8, OWL for Small Caliber Ammunition to PE 0604802A, Project EP4, One-Way Luminescence for Small Caliber Ammo; the project is not a new start. OWL develops a new tracer technology and applies it to multiple calibers. The initial focus was on 7.62mm ammunition in FY 2015 followed by 5.56mm in FY 2018. As the technology matures the project transitions to PE 0604802A, Project EP4 starting in FY 2018 for 7.62mm OWL, and FY 2021 for 5.56mm OWL. The OWL cartridge will be compatible with all Army Small Caliber weapon systems, but optimized for Machine Guns and will provide improved lethality/target effects over the current tracer munition.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 Caliber Munitions CDD.  Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter.  OWL projects objective is to develop and field a full day/night tracer round, replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm OWL cartridges and later followed by .50 Caliber cartridges.  FY 2019 funding will support post Milestone B (MS B) activities to include Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Design Verification Testing (DVT), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and a User Assessment (UA) for the 7.62mm caliber ammunition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The OWL concept will be developed through Government and Industry prototyping efforts. A Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) was conducted in FY 2015 and FY 2016 to measure the progress of the designs.  The FY 2017 TRA was conducted to evaluate the industry and Government concepts in order to proceed with the 7.62mm Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). The 5.56mm and .50 Caliber cartridges will follow the 7.62mm schedule with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) starting in FY 2021. The new tracer cartridges will replace legacy tracers in each of the various small caliber configurations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project will support Integrated System Design (ISD), System Capability (SC) and Manufacturing Process Demonstrations (MPD) on current pyrotechnic munitions and tunable pyrotechnic aircraft counter measures and decoys. The project will also support ISD, SC and MPD on new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided missile threats. Activities include modeling and simulation, flight testing, qualification testing, engineering to reduce size and weight, environmental considerations, safety enhancements, manufacturing enhancements, qualification of other service and foreign munitions that could meet current requirements, product improvements, insertion of new technologies to increase performance, and enhancement of current flare solutions for new and existing aircraft.  Systems include impulse cartridges, pen flares, hand held signals, trip flares, simulators, marine markers, smoke pots, smoke grenades, rail road flares and other type of emergency/distress devices, aircraft expendables (to include Radio Frequency (RF) expendables), and primers used in munitions systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 40mm High Velocity Improved High Explosive Dual Purpose (I-HEDP) cartridge will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. Milestone B approval will be followed by the award to one EMD contractor after the bid sample testing and source selection evaluation.  The contractor will mature the I-HEDP cartridge through Design Engineering Testing (DET).  Shortcomings and deficiencies will be corrected prior to subjecting the final design to the Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E). The test results will support the documentation for Milestone C and Type Classification-Limited Procurement (TC-LP) scheduled for FY 2021.  After Milestone C is achieved, a contract will be awarded for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) followed by two production year options.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 155mm High Explosive Extended Range Artillery Projectile project will evaluate, develop and qualify extended range technologies, including the XM1113 in 39 caliber weapon systems with legacy propellants.  The XM113 effort is a government owned materiel solution for long-range cannon artillery projectile that will increase range by 10km+ in 39 caliber weapon systems, and contain twice as much rocket motor grains as the current 155mm long range cannon projectile that is now obsolete.  The XM1113 will leverage enhanced lethality cannon munition technologies to compensate for increased rocket motor volume.  This design will utilize a high fragmentation steel body with a streamlined ogive and a high performance rocket motor.  The projectile body is filled with an insensitive munition (IM) high explosive (HE) and a supplementary charge.  FY 2019 will support the completion of the Developmental Test phase of Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) and the completion of the Critical Design Review (CDR) in 4Q FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) project will accelerate the qualification of Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT) on the 155mm XM1128 high explosive projectile, per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition 22 December 2016.  The project addresses requirements for increased lethality of 155mm high explosive unitary projectiles (Initial Draft Requirements for the XM1128 with Lithographic Fragmentation Technology, 24 February 2017).  The ELCM project will also evaluate, develop and qualify new lethality technologies for 155mm cannon artillery munitions and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to production.  The ELCM project will support testing of the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Systems M999 advanced cluster munition, per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition 22 December 2016.  The project will complete a lethality arena test on the M999 submunitions to be conducted at the IMI facility in Israel.   FY 2019 will support the completion of the Product Qualification Testing (PQT) test series for the XM1128 and the finalization of the Capability Production Document (CPD) by 4Q FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improved Multi-Option Fuze project will integrate the results of Budget Activity 04, Program Element 0603639A, Project EU2 and qualify/Type Classify (TC) new improved Multi-Option Fuzes (iMOFA/iMOFM) with Government-owned Next Generation Proximity Sensor (NGPS) capabilities containing built-in exportability attributes previously matured via OSD-sponsored tech base efforts under the Joint Fuze Technology Program and Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Congressional Pilot Program. Continuing FMS sales of non-precision artillery and mortar ammunition fuzes containing proximity technology will increase the incidence of reverse engineering (RE) and threat of electronic countermeasures (ECM).  If realized, these threats will negate the current battlefield advantages of U.S. troops.  This Project will develop and qualify safe, affordable, reliable Proximity/HoB fuzing solution for non-precision Cannon artillery and Mortar munitions that are resistant to adversary exploitation via ECM and RE threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The 40mm LV HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to engage targets at increased effective ranges using the 40mm M203/M320 Grenade Launcher. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased effective ranges with greater accuracy and lethality. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge. The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability. FY 2019 supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort for competing prototypes and continues EMD design activities.

The 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Door Breach (DB), XM1167, cartridge allows the grenadier to conduct a ballistic breach of an existing door creating an entry point into a building or other structure. This capability is critical during Urban Operations, while having stand-off ability to conduct ballistic breach at ranges up to 50 meters away, with a single-shot, and without pause between actual breach and entry of initial force. The 40mm DB cartridge will provide the small unit with the capability to conduct breaching operations; allowing the Warfighter to create an entry point in a structure allowing an assault element to enter and begin clearing operations, which is the most difficult type of operation that Soldiers may face in an urban environment. The 40mm DB cartridge will reduce collateral damage and friendly casualties associated with breaching operations.  The deployment of 40mm DB cartridges will enable the small unit to gain and maintain a tactical advantage through efficiency of combat power and momentum.  FY 2019 supports Design Engineering Testing (DET) and Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The HEAB cartridge will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. As part of the pre-EMD activities, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Testing with contractors will occur to evaluate potential designs. For EMD, the Government anticipates awarding two Full and Open competitive contracts. After Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E) the government will down-select to a single contractor for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and two production year options.

The Door Breach cartridge will be developed through a Competitive Bid Sample Test followed by a single award for an EMD program, which will consist of a 12-month qualification effort.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 30mm Lethality Project funds development of a suite of 30x173mm caliber cartridges, which includes anti-personnel tactical and training cartridges and anti-materiel tactical and training cartridges. The objective is to enhance the operational effectiveness and lethality of the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) and any Army Fighting Vehicles that are equipped with a 30x173mm weapon system. The tactical cartridges will provide an organic direct fire capability to support infantry at a greater range and will improve lethality when engaging dismounted infantry and like armored vehicles. The training cartridges will be ballistically matched to the tactical cartridges, allowing the Warfighter to train in a cost effective manner. This Project will leverage earlier efforts in support of the Stryker Operational Needs Statement for Increased Lethality. FY 2019 funding will continue to support the ammunition qualification activities and development of performance specifications in support of the 30x173mm Programmable Airburst Munitions - Tracer (PABM-T) Urgent Materiel Release (UMR). FY 2019 effort also includes activities for developing/qualifying a 30x173mm Programmable Airburst Munition (PABM) along with an initial Design Engineering Test (DET). The objective is to field airburst capable 30x173mm cartridges and programming/communication units for use in Stryker ICV and/or Army Future Fighting Vehicles.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be sent to industry soliciting responses to the requirements of Army Performance Specifications for the following items: 30x173mm anti-materiel tactical cartridge, 30x173mm anti-materiel training cartridge, 30x173mm anti-personnel tactical cartridge, and 30x173mm anti-personnel training cartridge.  Contracts will be awarded to viable contractors for the development and qualification of each family of cartridges (anti-personnel family and anti-materiel family).  Contractor designs will be subjected to Design Verification Tests.  Based on technical performance/maturity and cost, production contracts may be awarded for each family of cartridges.  The objective is to qualify two contract sources for the each cartridge.

In support of the 30x173mm programmable airburst munition (PABM), an RFP will be sent to industry.  Multiple contracts will be awarded for development and design engineering tests.  The Government will down-select and award a single contract to complete Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) in support of Milestone C.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a course correcting fuze that provides near precision accuracy and efficiency for current and future155mm High Explosive (HE) projectiles by eliminating a portion of the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions which effectively reduces the number of projectiles required to execute fire missions. PGK utilizes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and internal Guidance and Navigation Computer to accomplish its mission with point detonating and height of  burst fuzing functions.  The PGK M1156E1 effort will incorporate and qualify state of the art technologies to increase the functionality of PGK in GPS degraded environments as well as compatibility with the Army's new long range cannon and projectiles which will be fielded during the PGK Life Cycle.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance kit with fuzing functions for 155mm High Explosive (HE) artillery projectiles.  PGK provides near precision accuracy and effectiveness for 155mm HE projectiles.  The PGK corrects the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions and reduces the number of artillery projectiles required to execute the mission.  The current PGK Increment has been qualified for the M795 and M549A1 HE projectiles.  This increment of PGK entered Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) at Milestone C in March 2013. Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) was completed 3Q FY 2015, Full Material Release (FMR) was approved 1Q FY 2016, Full Rate Production (FRP) decision and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) occurred 2Q FY 2016.  On going PGK Modernization efforts are focused on addressing performance in a GPS degraded environment as well as compatibility with the Army's new long range 155mm cannon and projectile which are scheduled to be fielded in the same timeframe as the next increment of PGK.  The strategy includes competitive DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) concept development efforts with multiple contractors in FY 2017, followed by a DOTC Risk Reduction concept maturation phase in FY 2018.  This will be followed by a competitive FAR Based EMD effort beginning in FY 2019.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Tactical Electric Power (TEP) program which is established to develop a Modernized, Standard Family of Mobile Electric Power (MEP) systems to include MEP Generating Sources (MEPGS) and MEP Distribution Systems (MEPDS) for all Services throughout the Department of Defense.  Building on the device/component evaluations conducted in PE 0603804A project G11, this project supports the system development and demonstration of a series of innovative mobile electric power systems that are essential to the development and eventual fielding of modernized MEPGS and MEPDS.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support. FY19 funds will continue to develop the Management and Distribution Control (MDC) Phase 1: Prime Power Connection Kit (PPCK)  and the large Power Distribution Unit (PDU) performance specification to include developmental testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops the tools and processes that will optimize recommendations for the materiel used to establish, operate, and maintain contingency bases. The project will increase the available knowledge at the base level and provide an analytical foundation for sound investment decision making. The continuous improvement modeling and simulation analysis tools will match the evolution of threats and technologies. Using a system of systems engineering approach, the Contingency Base Infrastructure Product Directorate's focus ensures optimum integration of materiel across the base camp to facilitate the maximizing of Warfighter effectiveness. CBI's analytical results will allow leadership to make data driven, informed decisions on the acquisition and employment/deployment of equipment. This enables contingency bases to be established, operated and managed as a system (system of systems) and the equipment acquired for the base to be compatible and efficient while providing the maximum overall support to the Warfighter. This approach supports Program(s) of Record (PORs) to maximize improvements in Operational Energy and ensures efficiencies across all Areas of Responsibility (AOR).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Maneuver Support Vessel (Light) (MSV(L)) program element supports the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the program. The MSV(L) is a multifunctional waterborne mobility platform, which displaces the current Landing Craft Mechanized-8 (LCM-8).  The LCM-8 does not have the speed, functional draft (shallow water capability), and maneuver capability to move today's Army; cannot transport an Abrams tank.  The MSV(L) provides a waterborne corridor for movement and maneuver; expeditionary delivery of combat configured equipment, troops, and logistics, in austere anti-access/area denial environments; and operational capability from ship to shore and along coastal waters, narrow inland water ways, and rivers. This vessel's capability supports transporting multiple combat configured ready-to-fight payloads with crew (i.e. an Abrams tank; or two Strykers with bar armor; or four Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs); or two 20 ft. or one 40 ft. ISO container (Intermodal container); or a Heavy Expandable Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT); or a Load Handling System (LHS), and trailer). The MSV(L) will incorporate new roll-through capability via stern access and bow ramps.  The MSV(L) provides the capability to operate fully loaded at a speed of 15 knots in Beaufort Sea Scale 3 conditions, while being survivable (seaworthy) in Beaufort Sea Scale 7 conditions.  The vessel's force protection attributes includes a subsurface surveillance device for obstacle detection and avoidance, protection from small arms fire, and two Common Remotely Operated Weapon Stations (CROWS II) for vessel defense, and the capacity to mitigate detection through reduction of thermal and acoustic signature.  The MSV(L) provides increased capability that moves combat configured forces and supplies more efficiently than the LCM-8.

Army Watercraft funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, and survivability while increasing the lethality, tactical mobility, and operational capability of the Army Mariner.  Vessel lethality/Escalation of Force measures have increasingly become an area of vital concern to the Combatant Commanders (CCDR) given the requirement to preserve "freedom of the seas" access in all areas of the world, particularly the littorals, to support maneuver operations in all Areas of Responsibility.

FY19 funding will support completion of the contractor's design, full scale prototype build, testing and evaluation activities, and initial logistics assessments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The funding increase in FY18 is a result of cost associated with the build of the MSV(L) full-scale prototype.  The current schedule is an estimate.  Schedule revisions will occur after contract award which may include acceleration in the program if FY17 and FY18 funding remains intact.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The MSV(L) was a new start program beginning in FY16.  APE 0603804, Project 526 provided resourcing for research and development support to this program prior to the receipt of funding in Feb 16.
Significant Achievements:
- The Contract was awarded on 28 Sep 17 to Vigor Works, LLC.  
- On 22 Sep 17, obtained MDA approval for Milestone B and entry into the EMD phase.  
- The RFP was released on 27 Oct 16 and closed on 30 Jan 17.  The SSEB commenced 30 Jan 17.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MSV(L) will enter at MS B with an EMD Phase, followed by Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).  The acquisition strategy is to have a full and open competition with a down select from paper designs to one contractor at MS B.  The contract will award one 10 year contract to a single vendor comprised of EMD followed by the production and development phase.  Model basin testing will occur after successful execution of PDR. This sequence of events mitigate risks prior to the authorization of building the full size prototype.  The full size prototype will undergo testing which will inform the Capability Production Document (CPD).  Following successful prototype testing, at Knowledge Point (KP) 6, the program will transition to the Other Procurement Army (OPA) funding, and initiate LRIP.  Upon MS C approval, the Government will authorize the Production and Deployment phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>At MS B, The Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) established cost, schedule, and performance metrics.  Per the contract, the contractor will provide monthly cost and performance deliverables.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides all services with ample supply of clean fuel and water.  The Army has the mission to supply fuel for all land-based forces, including the Marines and the Air Force, and must supply bulk drinking water to the Soldiers.  These Engineering and Manufacturing Development programs enable the Army to improve maneuver sustainment operations to meet the demands of the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams and the Future Force.  The mission includes receiving and transferring petroleum from trucks, ships, pipelines and permanent and temporary storage facilities; moving petroleum from storage to and within corps and division areas; fuel quality surveillance testing; and dispensing in support of tactical operations, including rapid refueling of aircraft.  The mission covers water purification and waste water treatment, reutilization, storage, distribution, alternative water source acquisition, disposal, and quality control of water.  The Army cannot fight without clean fuel and water.  These Research and Development (R&amp;D) missions support the development and enhancement of rapidly deployed Petroleum and Water equipment which enables the Army to achieve its vision by providing a highly mobile and self-sustaining system in hostile joint operations areas.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The 3,000 (3k) Gallons per Hour (GPH) Tactical Water Purification System (TWPS) replaces the legacy 3,000 (3k) GPH Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), which is currently the largest water purification capability in the Army's inventory and is nearing the end of its useful life.  The 3k TWPS shall be the sole bulk water capability supporting Echelons Above Brigade (EAB) and will be the primary water purification capability for laundry and shower facilities.  Purifies up to 3,000 GPH from any water source, including 60,000 m g/L Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) salt water and CBRN contaminated sources.  Consists of feed water pumps, hoses, media and cartridge filters, high pressure pump, reverse osmosis elements, 3,000 gallon water storage and distribution system, and control panel.  Supports all tactical water missions LH S/PLS compatible via C HU/E-CHU</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development, demonstration, testing and evaluation within the Combat Engineer and Construction Support Equipment arena. These items include critical life support equipment such as diving, fire fighting, fire suppression, urban operations, breathable air compressors, and emergency and recovery sets along with engineer safety and special unit support equipment and photo support sets.  The Combat Engineer and Construction equipment consists of the Surveying, Firefighting Individual Requirements Equipment Support (FIRES), Urban Search and Rescue (USR), Fire Protection Equipment Type I, II and III, Tactical Fire Fighting Truck Tools (TFTT), Family of Electrical Personal Protective Equipment (FoEPPE) Family of Power Utility Kits (FoPUK), Distribution Utility Construction Kits (DUCT) and Soldier Portable Kits, Lineman's Tool Kit, Concrete and Masonry, Electricians, Plumbers, Pipefitters, Family of Light Sets (FoLS), Airfield Damage Repair Kit (ADRK), Diving Equipment, Surface Swimmer Support Sets, Surface Supplied Diving Set, procurement of new Technical/Special Tools, Pioneer Support Set, and the Pioneer Land Clearing and Building Erection Set. Project will explore Additive Manufacturing for Engineer sytems. Funding will support the procurement of market samples and testing for Soldier Portable Sets, Kits, and Outfits (SKO), Special Tools initiative, and critical life support equipment such as the Deep Sea Set, Underwater Construction Set, Closed Circuit Scuba Set, Supervisor Propulsion Emergency and Recovery SCUBA (SPEaRS), Divers' Supplemental Issue Set(DSIS), Vertical Skills Engineer Construction Kit (VSECK), and Family of Boats and Motors (FOBAM). 

BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION: These systems provide state-of-the-art deployable, critical life support and combat engineer and construction equipment along with engineer safety and special unit support equipment supporting the joint warfighter.  These programs minimize transportation requirements and reduce the logistical footprint by eliminating obsolete equipment and reducing the number of programs. Funding shall allow for development of dual use systems that support wartime use by Soldiers to include Special Forces and peacetime operations that include national disaster relief and homeland security operations.  Much of this equipment has an inherent short Economic Useful Life (EUL). Investments used to revise, update and obtain equipment within this portfolio has resulted in reductions in footprint, and increases in safety, effectiveness, and readiness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mobile Maintenance Equipment provides state of the art, deployable, vehicle-mounted, Soldier portable and containerized shelter tool systems supporting the Joint warfighter. These systems are equipped with industrial quality tools required for Two Level Maintenance that reduce common tool redundancy, provide tool standardization, minimize transportation requirements, reduces logistical footprint, and are backed by a Lifetime Warranty/Replacement Program which reduces sustainment costs. This is accomplished by employing a system of systems approach to maintenance acquisition. The System of Systems approach builds a maintenance capability upon each system, allowing a logical and natural approach to the Army's overall two level maintenance strategy. These inter-connected systems distributed throughout the Army at multiple levels and echelons provide a holistic repair capability in all scenarios and environments. These systems provide the Maintenance and Combat Commanders an unprecedented capability to repair wheeled, tracked, aviation, ground support and weapons systems on site at one location at one time. This approach to maintenance acquisition increases efficiencies and supports the current force while providing modular configurations designed to meet the specific needs of the Army maintainer in today's complex transforming environment. 

BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION:  The need to develop and maintain a System of System maintenance approach is critical due to the growing complexity of today's military equipment, operational tempo, modularity, and current and evolving Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The individual maintenance systems are comprehensive, interconnected and capable of solving and repairing any maintenance problems. The System of Systems approach does not advocate specific tools, methods or practices; instead it seeks to promote a streamlined comprehensive set of systems for solving maintenance challenges where the interactions of doctrine, technology, time and tactics techniques and procedures are the primary drivers.  Funding for projects shall include test article procurement and testing of soldier portable maintenance SKOs, load banks and refrigeration tool kit; investigation of new technologies for next generation mobile maintenance equipment shop sets including the Shop Equipment Welding (SEW) and Shop Equipment Contact Maintenance (SECM); development of additional Standard Automotive Tool Set (SATS) maintenance modules, Armament Repair Shop Set 2, Mobile Ammunition Processing Facility (MAPF), Special Tools initiatives, shelter mounted system development; packaging development; and technical support for emerging JCIDS materiel requirements documents. Additive Manufacturing upgrades to the Metal Working and Machining Shop Set (MWMSS) to include a 3-D printing and associated digital library capability. Modernization upgrades increase effectiveness while improving efficiency, reliability and maintainability while supporting emerging Army systems as well as using lower cost set components.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improved Environmental Control Units (IECU) program will provide updates that support the new generation of Environmental Control Units (ECUs) that use environmentally approved refrigerants, with zero Ozone-Depleting Chemicals (ODCs) to replace the current Military Standard (MIL-STD) Family of ECUs. The IECUs will provide improved cooling, heating and dehumidification to Soldiers and critical equipment systems in combat, combat support, combat service support units, and combat support hospitals. The IECUs are required to replace currently fielded ECUs in order to comply with statutory and regulatory restrictions on the use of Class II ODCs (such as HCFC-22) and to improve the performance of military ECUs. They are form, fit, and function replacements to the current MIL-STD ECUs. Technical improvements over existing ECUs will yield significant fuel and weight savings, reduction in scheduled maintenance and increased reliability. The new family of IECUs will utilize a new refrigerant which complies with mandated Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Funding supports the development of trailer-mounted systems, shelter system integration, as well as supporting the new ECU requirements coming from the Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2) Army Standard Family of Soft Walled Shelters (ASF-SWS) and Army Standard Family of Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF-RWS) Capabilities Development Documents (CDDs).  In addition, the field has identified an emerging requirement for an integrated fuel-fired /cooling system. These variants will further standardize cooling units in the field, enable cooling of larger shelters and structures, offer increased mobility, and may be used to cool multiple tents with one unit.  Funding also supports continued evaluation of IECUs and variants at Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) to support new operational concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) of critical soldier support and sustainment systems that provide more endurance and agility to combat operations enabling success of Army Expeditionary Forces in future multi-domain scenarios.  Project includes highly mobile shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), expeditionary base camp subsystems, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, field heaters, and other combat service support equipment. These systems will fill identified theater capability gaps, improve safety, improve unit sustainability, improve resource and energy efficiency and increase combat effectiveness. This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Prototyping, and testing of critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, force projection and maintenance platforms. This project develops critical enablers that support the Army Campaign Plan and Army Modernization Strategy by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment while reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Provides an integrated waste management (reduction, treatment or disposal process) add-on capability that can safely process 1,000 pounds (lbs) or more of mixed solid waste in a single day on site. Mixed solid waste produced on a single 150 person site must be properly managed through reduction, reuse, recycling, treatment, or disposal. Most of the waste is nonhazardous solid waste. Provides a substantial improvement over the current practice of burn pits that poses a health risk to Soldiers and/or backhaul which poses an addional logistics burden.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Containerized Ice Making System (CIMS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Develops an add-on ice making capability that automatically dispenses and seals 10 pound bags at a rate of a minimum of 3,600 pounds of ice per day. This capability is based upon current Army operational requirements for ice which is four pounds per Soldier per day. This capability enables support for up to 900 personnel. Current operations require external support to provide personnel with ice for cooling drinking water in extremely arid environments. This capability will reduce the sustainment risk and cost associated with transporting this commodity from external sources. The objective requirement enables stockage of ice to assist with surge operations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The ASF-RWS program will conduct formal development to incorporate the latest technologies into a fully supportable and modernized family. The intent is to eliminate the proliferation of non-standard shelters and their associated logistics burden, thereby reducing the lifecycle cost of RWS across the Services. The program will produce approved Technical Data Packages (TDPs) to support procurements by materiel developers and Program Managers (PMs) requiring RWS. Once developed and formally type-classified, ASF-RWS procurements are customer funded by PMs as a cost under their program(s). The ASF-RWS will consist of three variants: (1) Expandable/Non-Expandable; (2) Vehicle Mounted; and (3) Panelized/Collapsible with a focus on the following features and improvements: reduced cost, reduced weight, improved energy efficiency, improved corrosion resistance, and improved transportability.</r2:Description>

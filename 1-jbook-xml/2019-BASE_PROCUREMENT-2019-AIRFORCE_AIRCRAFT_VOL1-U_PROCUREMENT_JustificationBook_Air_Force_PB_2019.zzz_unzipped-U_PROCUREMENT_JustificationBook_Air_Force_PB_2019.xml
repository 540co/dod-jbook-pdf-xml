            <proc:Description>Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program will develop and field a family of aircraft that meets the needs of DoD and allies with the F-35A Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL) variant, the F-35B Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant, and the F-35C Carrier Variant (CV) with optimum commonality among the three variants to minimize life cycle costs.  This is a joint program with no executive service. Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy (DON)  and the Department of the Air Force (DAF) and currently resides with the Air Force.  The F-35s are the next generation of strike fighters which has increased aero-performance, stealth signature and countermeasures.  Its advanced avionics, data links and adverse weather precision targeting incorporates the latest technology available.  The F-35 has increased range with internal fuel and includes superior weaponry over existing aircraft.  The highly supportable, affordable, state of the art aircraft commands and maintains global air superiority.  The production cost and quantities are interdependent due to one manufacturer for the program.  USAF regular procurement commenced in FY07, DON regular procurement commenced in FY08.

                <proc:Description>The Joint Strike Fighter program will develop and field a family of aircraft that meets the needs of the United States and its international partners.  Specifically, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) will meet USAF Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL) requirements with the F-35A variant, the USMC Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) requirements with the F-35B variant, and DoN Carrier Variant (CV) requirements with the F-35C variant.  Commonality among the three variants is expected to reduce life cycle costs.  This is a joint program with no executive service.  Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force and currently resides with the Air Force. The F-35 is the next generation of strike fighter to command and maintain global air superiority.  The production cost and quantities are interdependent due to one manufacturer for the program.  Advance procurement funding will support Airframe and Engine long-lead parts and materials necessary to protect the delivery schedule of the FY 2020 aircraft buy, as well as associated termination liability.</proc:Description>
                <proc:Justification>The FY2019 budget requests $406M of Advanced Procurement for FY2020 long lead materials.  The Advance Procurement (AP) funding requested in FY2019 will support Airframe and Engine long-lead parts and materials necessary to protect the Lot 14 delivery schedule.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>1)  Airframe Unit Recurring Flyaway (URF) is directly affected by United States Air Force (USAF), Department of the Navy (DON) and International Partners quantity profile changes year over year.

(2) Non-recurring cost includes such items as the USAF share of Production Non-Recurring Tooling which is necessary to support planned production ramp-up.  In addition, it includes Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (Life-of-type part buys), concurrency engineering, technical assistance and Cost Reduction Initiatives (CRI).

(3) Year to year changes in Ancillary Equipment costs due to changes in aircraft quantity. Equipment includes Gen III Helmet Mounted Displays, launchers, and Pilot Flight Equipment.

(4) Depot Standup: Beginning with FY19, USAF added Depot Standup Cost Element to identify those costs peculiar to depot site activation and associated lay-in material.  These costs were previously rolled up in Airframe, Engine, and Avionics Peculiar Ground Support Equipment Cost Elements.

            <proc:Description>Open Skies Treaty (OST) Aircraft Recapitalization - Air Force Requirements Decision Memorandum (AFRDM) 11-17-03.  Recommends re-hosting this capability on two commercial off-the-shelf small airliner class aircraft, using Air Force unit-level maintenance and contract support for other levels of maintenance and logistics.

MDD scheduled for 3rd QTR FY19.
In BY19 Open Skies Recap is a New Start.
2 OC-135Bs will be replaced with 2 small airliner class aircraft
Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0305145F</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program is a new start.

Problems during Open Skies missions, combined with a lack of updated system requirements, motivated Open Skies program officials to request a Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) in July 2015 to study aircraft issues. The CBA was completed in June 2016 and indicated that key requirements in the 1992 Operational Requirements Document(ORD) were no longer current, and important requirements were not addressed in the document. It also showed the current OC-135B had capability performance gaps in range and mission completion.

The Open Skies program received permission in October 2016 to develop a Doctrine, Organization, Training, materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTmLPF-P) Change Recommendation (DCR). The DCR used a multi-disciplinary High Performance Team (HPT) to create and validate a series of required capabilities for an Open Skies aircraft, evaluate aircraft that could satisfy the required capabilities, and then consider each of the DCR elements as part of a recommended solution.

This DCR accomplishes two main purposes. First, it proposes updated required capabilities to replace the requirements in the 1992 ORD. These new required capabilities reflect both operational experience to date and expected Open Skies program needs for the foreseeable future. These new required capabilities can be satisfied by available commercial solutions.

The second is to recommend an Air Force solution that best satisfies program required capabilities. The recommendation of this DCR is for the USAF to procure or obtain two small airliner class aircraft for the Open Skies Treaty mission acquired in a method consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and other applicable guidance. The recommended training concept is for personnel to use existing contractor training facilities, equipment, and curriculum. Finally, the OCR recommends a maintenance concept for the small airliner class aircraft with military personnel performing unit-level maintenance actions and contractors responsible for other maintenance, such as parts supply, and supply chain management, performed under a Low Utilization Maintenance Program.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The C-130J is a medium-size transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 ft) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/Hs and the C-130J (short). 

Other variants of the USAF C-130J fleet are all short-bodied aircraft and include the EC-130J (airborne psychological operations), WC-130J (weather reconnaissance), HC-130J (combat search and rescue), MC-130J (special operations), and the AC-130J (close air support and armed reconnaissance). These variants are addressed in their own budget documents. 

17 C-130Js have been procured with National Guard, Reserve Equipment Account (NGREA) funds and are not included in the "Prior Years" section of this document. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401132F which also contains associated Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding. 

Program funding includes Diminishing Manufacturing Sources.  

FY17 funding totals include $73M of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) for a combat loss.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY19 funding provides logistics support for aircraft, aircrew and maintenance training devices, and program management support.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Replacement of the legacy tanker fleet will take place in several stages. The initial tanker replacement increment of KC-46s will replace roughly a third of the current capability. Future programs will ultimately recapitalize the entire tanker fleet over a period of more than 30 years.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of aerial refueling aircraft. Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract. To initiate the first phase of the tanker replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010. The KC-46 program held a Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&amp;L)) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft. The program is procuring four RDT&amp;E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability which will ultimately be operationally fielded. During production, the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots. The KC-46 program held a MS C DAB on 12 Aug 2016 and received approval to enter low late initial production (LRIP).  The program awarded Lots 1 and 2 on 18 Aug 2016 and Lot 3 on 27 Jan 2017, totaling 34 aircraft.  Initial sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS). KC-46 funding also supports Training Systems, Support Equipment, Operational Site Activation, Depot Stand-Up, Alternate Mission Equipment (AME), Direct Mission Support, Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, Other Government Costs (OGC), various studies and analyses, future tanker replacement planning activities, long lead items, and potential Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence planning activities.  

The KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation capabilities. The KC-46 will operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces. The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats. 

The Aircrew Training System (ATS) and Maintenance Training System (MTS) are being developed and procured using KC-46 funding. The ATS contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation.  The ATS contract will provide Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), to include Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), Boom Operator Trainers (BOTs), Fuselage Trainers (FuTs), and Part-Task Trainers (PTTs) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU). The ATS contract will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire a technical data package to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  The ATS initial production options were exercised on 19 Aug 2015 with the second options exercised on 31 May 2017.  The MTS contract was awarded 6 Jul 2016 to The Boeing Company.  The MTS acquisition focuses on designing, developing, testing, producing, and fielding an optimized training system for KC-46 maintainers by integrating various forms of training media and Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs) into a "blended" solution.  This blended solution includes the appropriate mix of hardware and software, "high-fidelity" Augmented Hardware Training Devices (AHTDs), PTTs, Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), and emerging technologies to meet validated Air Mobility Command (AMC) maintenance training requirements.  The MTS initial production options were exercised on 15 Jun 2017 in support of ready for training dates.

The MS B acquisition strategy planned for two LRIP lots followed by 11 Full-Rate Production (FRP) lots for a total aircraft procurement of 175 production aircraft.  An update to the acquisition strategy occurred in support of MS C that increased LRIP from two to four lots, with the total aircraft buy remaining at 175 production aircraft.  A December 2017 USD(AT&amp;L) Acquisition Decision Memorandum expanded LRIP to include Lot 5.

LRIP began with two FFP and three FFP Not to Exceed (NTE) options (LRIP-1 Qty 7, LRIP-2 Qty 12, LRIP-3 Qty 15, LRIP-4 Qty 15, and LRIP-5 Qty 15) followed by eight FRP options [via NTE values + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)].  The MS C acquisition strategy for Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) changed from Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) to Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in FY 2017; funding procured LAIRCM for Lot 3 and Lot 4 aircraft.  FY 2019 funding provides for the procurement of LAIRCM in support of future year aircraft production.

In May 2016, the program announced a delay to aircraft deliveries and issued a Program Deviation Report declaring an Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) schedule breach.  The primary causes of the delays are certification and receipt of fully-conformed hardware for the Wing Aerial Refueling Pods (WARPs) and Centerline Drogue System (CDS), which are the systems used to refuel probe-and-drogue receiver aircraft.  Additionally, Boeing needs more time to incorporated design changes into the production aircraft.  The KC-46 program is now operating to an updated schedule that was reviewed at MS C, captured in a new Integrated Master Schedule that was delivered in Dec 2016, and incorporated into a new APB that was approved in Jan 2017.  The current schedule is known as KC-46 Rebaseline-0800 (KCR-0800) and new aircraft delivery dates are reflected in this document.  Boeing projects the first aircraft delivery 19 Apr 2018. The Air Force will continue to support Boeing's efforts to execute the program, however the Air Force assessment predicts deliveries beyond Boeing's forecast beyond late spring 2018 unless performance improves.  

Note: Initial Spares were procured with Aircraft Procurement, Air Force (APAF), Aircraft Weapon System funding in FY 2015 and transitioned to APAF, Aircraft Initial Spares and Repairs funding in FY 2016.  Spare engines are included within the Initial Spares line. 

KC-46 is code B as it has not yet completed a FRP decision.  The KC-46 program successfully completed Critical Design Review (CDR) in Aug 2013, one month ahead of the contractual requirement. Live Fire Testing began in Apr 2011 and completed in FY 2016 with a final report due in FY 2018.  Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) is scheduled for the first quarter of FY 2015 through the fourth quarter of FY 2018 with plans to utilize LRIP aircraft. KC-46 First Flight occurred on 25 Sep 2015.  Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of FY 2018 contingent upon planned availability of LRIP aircraft and scheduled delivery of Tech Orders.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), the KC-46 is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Justification>The FY 2019 budget supports the procurement of 15 KC-46A aircraft along with other necessary associated expenses to deliver, sustain, and maintain the Lot 5 aircraft buy to include Support Equipment, Operational Site Activation, Depot Stand-Up, ICS, Alternate Mission Equipment (e.g., WARPs, Palletized Seating), and Direct Mission Support.  FY 2019 funding provides for the procurement of long-lead GFE (e.g., LAIRCM) in support of future year aircraft production.  The WARP kits (2 pods per kit) will be procured as CFE.    

PMA activities for contractor services and OGCs are included in the FY 2019 funding.  The FY 2019 funding will also support studies and analyses and potential DMS/obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.

The KC-46 FY 2019 funding will include ATS procurement of ATDs, MTS procurement of MTDs, and compulsory elements required to support Aircrew and Maintenance Training throughput levels as identified by AMC.</proc:Justification>

Due to program delays, ICS Period 1 was extended at no cost to the government. This extension facilitated the realignment of funding for subsequent ICS Periods (2-5). ICS funding requirements return to normal in FY 2019 with ICS Period 4.  

AMC's current operational strategy is for all KC-46 aircraft to be capable of utilizing Wing Aerial Refueling Pods (WARPs), but there is currently no requirement to procure an equal number of WARPs to aircraft. Instead, the WARPs will be used on select missions, as needed. The program will procure a total of 42 WARP kits.

Flyaway cost elements (LAIRCM &amp; AME) have been broken out to show a lower level of detail to accurately reflect the acquisition strategy and execution of these requirements. 

The Support cost element Data, which existed in previous budget documentation, has been removed.  The contract currently allows for Data as Not Separately Priced (NSP) Options which will be exercised along with each Aircraft Lot buy.

Unit Cost Variations: The Airframe unit cost is based on the aircraft unit prices proposed during the KC-46 competition.  These prices and projected escalation vary from year to year, leading to variability in the unit cost.  In addition, fluctuations are driven by non-recurring contract costs associated with the Production of the aircraft.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>Specs Available Now: These lots are pre-negotiated options to the KC-46 EMD contract based on the current aircraft system specification. The initial product baseline established at CDR will support the MS C decision and LRIP. Boeing is responsible for the correction of any deficiencies discovered in the KC-46 weapon system components (e.g., air vehicle, support equipment, training) during EMD to include the periods of integrated test (DT, OT, FAA, AR Cert) through IOT&amp;E or after collection of receiver certification data for nineteen (19) receiver aircraft pairings during Phase 3 AR Cert, whichever occurs later.  This product baseline will be finalized and validated at the Physical Configuration Audit.

Unit Cost Variations: The Airframe unit cost is based on the aircraft unit prices proposed during the KC-46 competition.  These prices and projected escalation vary from year to year, leading to variability in the unit cost.  In addition, fluctuations are driven by non-recurring contract costs associated with the Production of the aircraft.

RFP Issue Date:  Lot 1 &amp; 2 were pre-priced options established at EMD contract award.  Feb 2016 represents the Notice of Intent to Exercise Production Options sent to Boeing.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>
                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>Minimum Sustaining Rate (MSR) for production is 12 aircraft/year. 

Economic Rate does not reflect 1 shift of 8 hours 5 days a week; aligns to Boeing's operating plan. 

Admin Lead Time to definitize Not to Exceed (NTE) production options is 18-24 months; definitization of NTE does not have to occur prior to option award.

Production deliveries exceeding the 12 month period:
Boeing made a business decision to build aircraft at risk, ahead of contract award, in order to meet original contract requirements to deliver Required Assets Available (RAA) of 18 aircraft by August 2017.  These 18 aircraft are part of Lot 1, Lot 2, and Lot 3.  Due to continued KC-46 design changes during development, four aircraft in Lot 1 require significant change incorporation to bring them up to the production baseline.  This change incorporation will delay four Lot 1 aircraft deliveries, however this will not delay the overall delivery of aircraft to the warfighter because Boeing continues to build ahead of contractual delivery dates and will have 18 aircraft ready to deliver over 6-months once aircraft deliveries start.

Boeing projects the first aircraft delivery 19 Apr 2018. The Air Force will to continue to support Boeing's efforts to execute the program, however the Air Force assessment products deliveries beyond Boeing's forecast beyond late spring 2018 unless performance improves.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>HC-130 recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleet of combat rescue HC-130P/N aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.  A common baseline aircraft configuration is being provided for the HC-130 Recap, the MC-130 Recap and the AC-130 Recap programs.  

Beginning with the FY11 President's Budget, the HC-130 Recap and MC-130 Recap programs are being reported separately for improved visibility. Eight HC-130Js were procured under the combined HC/MC-130 Recap program. 
 
This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding in PE 0605278F. 

Program funding includes Depot Activation costs, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources, and allows for corrections of production deficiencies. This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.


Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207224F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY 2019 budget supports the production of 2 HC-130Js and associated support requirements.</proc:Justification>

Prior year HC-130 Recap program details are reported as part of the HC/MC Recap program. Eight HC-130Js were procured under the combined HC/MC-130 Recap program.

Advance procurement items are limited to components whose long lead times require purchase early in order to reduce the overall procurement lead time of the major end item. These long lead items include
structural components, engine mounts, engine components, flap shafts, and generators.

                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>The C-130J production line produces 24 aircraft per year through 2019.  This includes all USG, FMS, and commercial variants.  Production rate will drop to 16 aircraft per year in approximately 2020.  What appear to be gaps in production are filled by other types of C-130Js.  The C-130J P-21, Line Item P-4, depicts the complete C-130J production line schedule.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

                        <proc:Description>HC-130 recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations. A common
baseline aircraft configuration is being provided for the HC-130 Recap, the MC-130 Recap and new AC-130 Recap programs.

Beginning with the FY11 President's Budget, the HC-130 Recap and MC-130 Recap programs are being reported separately for improved visibility. FY08-10 HC-130 Recap program details are reported as part
of the HC/MC Recap program.

Advance procurement items are limited to components whose long-lead times require purchase early in order to reduce the overall procurement lead-time of the major end item. These long lead items include structural components, engine mounts, engine components, flap shafts, and generators.

            <proc:Description>MC-130 recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of special operations MC-130E/H/P/W aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.  A common baseline aircraft configuration is being provided for the MC-130 Recap, the HC-130 Recap, and AC-130 Recap programs.   

Beginning with the FY11 President's Budget, the HC-130 Recap and MC-130 Recap programs are being reported separately for improved visibility.  Prior year MC-130 Recap program details are reported as part of the HC/MC Recap program.  Fifteen MC-130J were procured under the combined HC/MC-130 Recap program.

This funding request incorporates a Multiyear Procurement (MYP) for FY19 thru FY23.  In support of the FY19 MYP, $88M of Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) funding is included in the FY19 request.

Advance procurement items are limited to components whos long-lead items require early purchase in order to reduce the overall procurement lead-time of the major end item.  These long lead items include structural components, engine mounts, engine components, flap shafts, and generators.

Program funding includes Depot Activation costs, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources, and allows for corrections of production deficiencies. This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207230F.</proc:Description>

                        <proc:Description>MC-130 recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of special operations MC-130E/H/P/W aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations. 

A common baseline aircraft configuration is being provided for the MC-130 Recap, the HC-130 Recap, and AC-130 Recap programs.  Beginning with the FY11 President's Budget, the HC-130 Recap and MC-130 Recap programs are being reported separately for improved visibility. Prior year MC-130 Recap program details are reported as part of the HC/MC Recap program. Fifteen MC-130J were procured under the combined HC/MC-130 Recap program.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207230F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The UH-1N Replacement program will replace the Air Force fleet of 63 UH-1N aircraft, which have significant capability gaps in the areas of speed, range, endurance, payload capacity, and aircraft self-protection. The Air Force intends to replace these UH-1Ns with modern helicopters that will eliminate these capability gaps.  The replacement aircraft will provide vertical airlift and support the requirements of five Air Force major commands and operating agencies: Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Force District of Washington, Air Education and Training Command, Pacific Air Forces, and Air Force Material Command. AFGSC is the Air Force lead command and operational capability requirements sponsor. This program is an element of the Air Force's nuclear enterprise reform initiatives.

This program has associated RDT&amp;E, AF funding in the Budget Year to provide for one-time systems engineering activities for non-developmental item (NDI) integration onto an airworthiness-certified baseline helicopter and associated testing and certifications.  FY2019 RDT&amp;E, AF funding also provides for the initiation of live fire test and evaluation activities necessary to assess compliance with aircraft self-protection and survivability requirements.  The UH-1N Replacement solution is expected to undergo qualification and operational test and evaluation in FY2020-FY2021 to validate the aircraft's operational performance, effectiveness, and suitability.

            <proc:Description>The Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH) program will replace the aging HH-60G. The HH-60G currently supports the Air Force's core function of Personnel Recovery. The primary mission of the HH-60G is to conduct day / night / marginal weather Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) in order to recover downed aircrew or other isolated personnel in hostile or non-permissive environments.

The CRH will be capable of employing in day or night, adverse weather, and in a variety of threat spectrums from terrorist attacks to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. Onboard defensive capabilities will permit the CRH system to operate in an increased threat environment. An in-flight air refueling capability will provide an airborne alert capability and extend its combat mission range. The CRH system may conduct combat search and rescue airborne mission commander duties.  The aircraft will be self-supporting to the maximum extent practical.  The CRH system may also conduct other collateral missions inherent in its capabilities to conduct Personnel Recovery, such as non-conventional assisted recovery, non-conventional evacuation operations, defense support to civil authorities, civil search and rescue, international aid, emergency aeromedical evacuation, disaster/humanitarian relief, counterdrug activities, support for National Aeronautics and Space Administration flight operations, and insertion/extraction of combat forces.

The CRH program Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) occurred in June 2014, and the program office (PO) received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&amp;L)).  The PO then awarded an EMD contract to Sikorsky Aircraft Company to develop and procure 112 CRH aircraft, training systems and associated support. The program is procuring four EMD aircraft and five System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) aircraft.  During production, the program plans to procure 103 aircraft throughout 8 lots. For low rate initial production (LRIP), Lots 1 and 2 will procure up to 22 aircraft in FY19 &amp; FY20.  During full rate production (FRP), Lots 3 through 8 will procure remaining aircraft through 2026.  Initial aircraft sustainment efforts will be provided by the contractor.  CRH funding also supports Training Systems, Support Equipment, Initial Spares, Operation Site Activation, Depot Stand-Up, Direct Mission Support, Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, Other Government Costs (OGC), various studies and analysis, future CRH planning activities, and potential Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence planning activities.

The CRH program is acquiring a complete Training system to include motion and non-motion simulators, and other aircrew and maintenance part task training devices. It also includes Type I training, aircrew and maintenance courseware, spares, Interim Contractor Support (ICS), and support equipment. 

Initial spares will be procured with Aircraft Procurement, Air Force (APAF), Aircraft Weapon System funding in FY19.  Spare engines are included within the Initial Spares.

CRH is moving towards a MS C decision in 3QFY19 with FRP Decision in FY21.  The CRH program conducted Critical Design Review in May 2017.   

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207229F. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program is a new start.

The program will procure the first LRIP lot of 10 aircraft along with associated initial spares, support equipment, depot-stand up activity, site activation support, training, and other program management administration activities in FY19.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The CV-22 is the Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the joint multi-mission V-22 tilt rotor aircraft. The CV-22 provides long-range, high-speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. The Navy is the lead service for the Joint V-22 program.  The Joint Program Manager is responsible for managing all variants of the V-22.  Department of the Navy (DoN) funds the development of the MV-22 and CMV-22.  The Air Force funds the service common portion of the CV-22 while United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) funds the development and procurement of SOF peculiar systems.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0401318F.

Flyaway unit cost includes recurring and non-recurring flyaway costs.

Any residual funding will result in addressing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Full-scale and subscale Aerial Targets assure warfighters weapon systems will perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles. Aerial Targets provide adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366 "Live Fire/Lethality" developmental/operational test requirements. Target drones are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates. Targets are essential for development testing/operational testing for all air-to-air (e.g., AMRAAM, AIM-9x, etc.) and surface-to-air missiles (e.g. PAC 3, FIM 92 Stinger), and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, and F-15 aircraft. The objective is to provide threat realistic targets for missile testing to enable the development of offensive counter-air systems (air-to-air and surface-to-air) capable of defeating changing enemy airborne threats. This program provides funds for the procurement of subscale aerial targets (BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target - AFSAT), full-scale aerial targets (QF-16), Target Control System (TCS), and includes procurement of associated mission and support equipment. Funding supports associated systems such as target control and scoring systems essential to aerial target operations. The TCS program ensures software interoperability among service ranges, the encryption of range/aircraft data links, and associated communication devices. Aerial targets and associated systems are required for Congressionally mandated testing and Air Force developmental and operational testing. Funding also provides for capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. 

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0305116F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY19 AFSAT funds will be used to procure 29 USAF production assets, support equipment, sustaining, production and diminishing manufacturing engineering support. 

FY19 QF-16 funds will be used to procure 19 USAF production assets, support equipment, sustaining, production and diminishing manufacturing engineering support.

            <proc:Description>The COMPASS CALL capability is the USAF's premier wide-area coverage Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Offensive Counter Information (OCI) weapon system.

The current COMPASS CALL program of record as of first quarter of FY 2018 include the following resources: fifteen (15) EC-130H Total Active Inventory (TAI) aircraft, one (1) Weapon System Trainer (WST, a.k.a. flight deck simulator) and two (2) COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS). Of the EC-130H aircraft ten (10) are designated Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI), two (2) are Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI), two (2) are in attrition reserve and one (1) is Primary Development/Test Aircraft Inventory (PDAI). Transitioning to the re-host effort, the program of record procured two (2) commercial derivative aircraft (will be known as EC-37B); one was procured in late FY 2017 and one will be procured in FY 2018. These two aircraft will receive upgraded Prime Mission Equipment (PME) from donor EC-130H aircraft. Modification efforts for the re-hosted aircraft are performed under the Aircraft Procurement, Air Force appropriation, Budget Activity 05, Budget Sub Activity 5 under P-1 Line Item Number: CALL00/COMPASS CALL Mods.

The program's Doctrine, Organization, Training, materiel, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel, Facilities (DOTmLPF) Change Request (DCR) was approved and validated on 23 March 2016. The DCR drives the re-hosting of COMPASS CALL PME from an EC-130H to a modern, more cost-effective, survivable and operationally suitable commercial derivative aircraft which meets the requirements of the combatant commands. The USAF began the procurement of the replacement capability for the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet in FY 2017.  The second EC-37B aircraft will be procured in FY 2018, and subsequent EC-37B aircraft will be procured at a rate of one (1) per year until a total of ten (10) aircraft are procured. However, legislative limitations on obligations and expenditures in FY 2017 and FY 2018 place the program's schedule and procurement plan at risk.

Due to the age of the EC-130H fleet (average age is 45 years), the re-hosting of the PME is crucial to ensuring the survival of this critical capability. The re-hosted COMPASS CALL platform will utilize 70% of the PME off of the current airframe without modification; the remaining PME will be repackaged for the re-host. The re-hosted COMPASS CALL aircraft will provide increased range, speed, endurance, operating altitude for better stand-off range, survivability and maintainability. This will enable the USAF to effectively conduct Electronic Attack (EA) in an Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD) environment. The re-hosted COMPASS CALL platform is based on a commercially available aircraft already equipped with the applicable modifications to host COMPASS CALL's PME and antenna arrays, as well as the corresponding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) and Military Type Certificates (MTC).

EC-130H airframe maintenance costs have increased every year and the re-hosting effort will dramatically curtail COMPASS CALL maintenance costs. The re-hosted COMPASS CALL platform will be maintained via contract logistic support, as directed to maintain its FAA STC. This will further decrease the cost of aircraft maintenance and free up active duty maintenance billets for other USAF priorities.

The COMPASS CALL Program is managed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207253F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY19 budget supports the procurement of one commercial modifiable aircraft.  This COMPASS CALL system allows for EW technology advancements.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides high altitude, deep look, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. In two related Acquisition Decision Memorandums (ADM) signed by USD (AT&amp;L) in January and June 2011, the RQ-4 program was directed to restructure into four major sub-programs: (1) RQ-4 baseline, (2) Block 30, (3) Block 40, and (4) Ground Segment/Communications System. Additionally, the Air Force created a RQ-4 Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I) for the Airborne Sense and Avoid line item (name has been changed to RQ-4 Common Airborne Sense &amp; Avoid (C-ABSAA)) to accommodate inclusion of required capability to meet warfighter needs beyond those requirements satisfied in the directed sub-programs. 

The RQ-4B is the successor to the RQ-4A, and is designed to employ 3,000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT) collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors - Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) - in an imagery intelligence only configuration. One SAR capable Block 20 remains in the fleet. Additionally, 4 Block 20's have been converted to Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) of which 3 remain active. These aircraft are not SAR capable. The remaining Block 20 aircraft support test projects for all RQ-4 Blocks. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20, and integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor, the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP). EISS and ASIP are used simultaneously to create a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 integrates the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar that has GMTI capability. The ground segment includes the Mission Control Element (MCE) and the Launch Recovery Element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable operation of the RQ-4 System. The RQ-4 program will incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, including the U.S. Navy's Triton, and other RPA weapon systems.

MQ-9 Reaper procurement includes all components of the MQ-9 weapon system. The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, a Ground Control Station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed in a plug-and-play mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs. Due to the nature of the platform, all future production requirements may vary based on warfighter necessity and available funding. 

The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties. The aircraft is being designed primarily to prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TST) as a radar, Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer) while performing Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA). In the hunter-killer role, the aircraft will employ fused multi-spectral sensor information to find, fix, and track ground targets and assess post-strike results using Automatic Target Cuing (ATC), Target Location Accuracy (TLA), Metric Sensor and other capabilities. 

The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft from either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning functions; provides a means for manual and/or autonomous command and control; allows personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; secure data links to receive payload sensor data and command links; monitor threats to the aircraft; display common operational picture information; and provide support functions. Additionally, a Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing, systems checks, maintaining, launching, and recovering aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed GCS. The GCS will continue to evolve and upgrade its capabilities to keep pace with MQ-9 system capabilities, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and the missions they perform. Near-term upgrades include new LINUX processors, high definition monitors, and ergonomic improvements. Future planned upgrades include integrating improved human-machine interfaces, open systems architecture, improved crew habitability, and multiple aircraft control. Future GCS configurations will leverage the Unmanned Aerospace System (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned open system standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight. 

Flyaway cost subtotal includes GCS, Ground Data Terminals (GDTs), and Predator Primary Satellite Links (PPSLs) which are not procured in the same quantities as aircraft. Thus, the unit flyaway cost will fluctuate from year to year as different quantities of GCSs, GDTs, and PPSLs are procured.

Block 50 GCS production initial buys will be used for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) development for the Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) school house and other training units. The initial production of Block 50 was delayed in order to meet a new single Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirement from ACC. Block 30 GCS Production will continue until the Block 50 GCS successfully passes DT/OT and receives a fielding decision. 

MQ-9s are procured sole-source with General Atomics-Aeronautical Systems Incorporated (GA-ASI). GA-ASI is responsible for the aircraft and Ground Control Station (GCS), The Raytheon Company for the Multi-Spectral Targeting System-B (MTS-B) EO/IR sensor, and L3 Communications for the Operator Simulator and satellite communication (SATCOM) infrastructure components. 

This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation AF funding in PE 0205219F MQ-9 Reaper UAV.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0205219F.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) issues 

MQ-9 IPR completed 11 Sep 2017, program ID Code is now A. A formal FRP will not be completed due to the de facto production decision provided by continued funding beyond Low Rate Initial Production. Developmental specifications are being used for contracting.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>A. Aircraft Production - "Other Contingency Operations" Funding procures 21 of the latest configuration of the MQ-9 aircraft to support service life replacement of aging aircraft.

B.  Production Support - funding included in Production Support consists of Engineering Change Orders (ECO) urgent services, and non-recurring production costs associated with diminishing manufacturing sources, reliability and maintenance (R&amp;M), safety enhancements, and higher level initiatives directed by the Air Force.

C. Ground Control Station &amp; Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) - Ground Control Stations, used for MQ-9 operations to support the standup, fielding, and sustainment of 60 Combat Lines (CL). This effort procures Ground Control Stations (GCS). The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft from either within line-of-sight (LOS) or beyond LOS (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. GCS are used to support Remote Split Operations (RSO) from Continental United States locations, and launch/recovery from forward operating locations. The total quantity and configuration procured is determined by budget and mission requirements.

D.  Other Government Costs (OGC) - Funding for OGCs includes direct mission support and Program Management Administration (PMA).  PMA includes, but not limited to, program office costs such as Management Information System (MIS) support, travel, training, security, and facility management.  In addition, costs for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) for program management, logistics, integration and test, and administration support services are included.

                    <proc:Remarks>Ground Control Station (GCS) &amp; GFE - The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft from either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. GCSs are used primarily to support Remote Split Operations (RSO) from Continental United States locations. Block 30 GCS procurement begins FY15 and is currently planned through FY18. ACC conducting analysis which can cause GCS QTY to change in year of execution. 

Flyaway cost subtotal includes GCS, Ground Data Terminals (GDT), and Predator Primary Satellite Link (PPSL) which are not procured in the same quantities as aircraft. Thus, the flyaway cost will fluctuate from year to year as different quantities of GCSs, GDTs, and PPSLs are procured.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>MQ-9 IPR completed 11 Sep 2017, program ID Code is now A. A formal FRP will not be completed due to the de facto production decision provided by continued funding beyond Low Rate Initial Production. Developmental specifications are being used for contracting.

MQ-9 Aircraft
Four (4) of the thirty-three (33) FY16 aircraft were purchased using OCO funding
Twenty-four (24) FY17 aircraft were purchased using OCO funding.
Sixteen (16) FY18 aircraft will be purchased using OCO funding.
Twenty-one(21) FY19 aircraft will be purchased using OCO funding.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>
                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>MQ-9 Reaper Aircraft: This effort will procure Block 5 MQ-9 Reaper aircraft and associated MTS-B Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR) sensors, Lynx Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, and Hellfire launchers and rails. 

The FY12 aircraft production took longer than twelve (12) months due to the Block 1 to Block 5 aircraft production line conversion, and the Accelerated Extended Range JUON production cut-in.

Due to FOT&amp;E compliance discussions, the FY13 aircraft did not begin delivery until August 2016.  This further led to a delay in negotiations for the FY15 aircraft buy, causing a four (4) month production break.  This production break is captured in the FY14 funding that was utilized in the FY15 aircraft buy.  FY14 funding was utilized on the FY15 aircraft buy to accelerate the FY18 requirement.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>FY 2017 funding totals include $25.600M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.
FY 2018 funding totals include $129.450M requested for Overseas Contingency Operations.

Program Description:  Aircraft Initial Spares are required to fill the initial pipeline or inventory for all new aircraft systems, including modifications, support equipment, and other production categories.  Initial spares include peculiar repairable and consumable components, assemblies, and sub-assemblies that must be available for issue at all levels of supply in time to support newly fielded end items.

The following Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) have funding in this line:
F-35,198 
FAB-T, 199
V-22, 212
B-2 EHF Inc I, 224
AWACS UPGRADE, 277
KC-46A, 387
MQ-9 UAS Reaper, 424
F-22 Inc 3.2B Mod, 474
F-15 EPAWSS, 485
RQ-4A/B Global Hawk, 252

Initial spares are funded in the two program segments described below.

Working Capital Fund (WCF) Spares.  Since FY 1994, some programs have used obligation authority in the WCF to procure initial spares.  When the spares are delivered this central procurement account will reimburse the WCF.  Types of spares in this program segment are Readiness Spares Packages, New Acquisition Spares, Modification Spares, Support Equipment, Other Production, and Consumables.

Exempt Spares.  This program segment finances spares that are not purchased through the WCF.  The budget authority is a direct cite on the contract.  Types of spares in this program segment are Whole Spare Engines, Whole Spare Quick Engine Change Kits, Contractor Logistics Support, Simulators/Trainers, New Acquisition Spares, Modification Spares, Support Equipment, Classified Equipment, and Munitions.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In FY 2019, the funding request for KC-46A Tanker Squadrons and F-35 have large initial spares requirements in preparation for fielding.</proc:Justification>

FY18 funding totals include $25.417M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operation.

This program provides funding for the procurement of replacement organizational and intermediate level support equipment for out-of-production aircraft. These items, common (used on more than one weapon system) and peculiar (unique to one weapon system), directly support aircraft maintenance, servicing, and sortie generation requirements. These replacement requirements ensure continuation of serviceable, supportable equipment over the life of a weapon system and directly contribute to aircraft availability and mission readiness. Items requiring replacement typically range in age from 10 to 35 years old. As a result, this equipment suffers frequent failures, is uneconomical to repair, and requires spare parts that are no longer available. Many items have become technologically obsolete or must be replaced due to environmental operating constraints. Items of equipment budgeted within this program include (but not limited to): avionics test stations, miscellaneous aerospace ground equipment, aircraft handling equipment, aircraft maintenance stands, flight line compressors, air conditioners and heaters, aerial stores lift trucks (jammers) and weapon loading adapters, ammunition loaders and munitions assembly conveyors, cryogenic equipment, small and large munitions trailers, flight line generators and secondary power systems, electronic test sets, propulsion support equipment, calibration, optical and ancillary testers, and automatic test systems. These items support multiple Air Force weapon systems. Failure to procure these items will negatively affect mission capable rates, increase maintenance costs, and increase sortie turn times. 


PROGRAMS SUPPORTED: 
Flight Line Air Conditioners/Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (SEV)
The Flight Line Air Conditioner/Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) program will procure a combination of large and small, high and low pressure deployable air conditioners in support of all aircraft in the Air Force inventory. Its purpose is to provide conditioned air for supporting pre-flight activities and ground maintenance efforts for electronic laden aircraft supporting radar, avionic, and telemetry systems. The large air conditioners will replace three legacy systems (approx. 400 units): ACE802, PD-501 and DAC-110. The small air conditioners will replace 5 legacy systems (approx. 2,400 units): TUG AC-25D, MA-3D, C-5, C-19, and C-10D. Operational assessments determined that legacy air conditioners were not performing to their specified operating temperatures. These air conditioners are exceeding their twenty year life expectancy. The age of this equipment, high temperatures, and other environmental conditions in the Middle East have caused legacy air conditioners to fail, affecting operational readiness and jeopardizing critical missions. Due to obsolescence, continued modification of legacy equipment is not feasible and/or cost prohibitive. Lack of dependable air conditioning equipment continues to cause operational impacts such as rescheduling maintenance activities to nighttime operations or delaying sorties in order to avoid overheating of critical electronic warfare/avionics systems and personnel. Consequently, the warfighter has established a critical need for large and small Flight-Line Air Conditioner replacement programs.

B-1B Advanced Radar/Electronic Warfare Test Station (ARTS) (ATS)
The Advanced Radar/Electronic Warfare Test Station (ARTS) replaces 1970s vintage Radar/Electronic Warfare (REW) test stations and the Defensive Avionics Augmentation Equipment (DAAE). ARTS is a fully automated, programmable, stimulus generating, response measuring, intermediate automatic test equipment that will checkout, align, and fault isolates 21 avionics Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). ARTS interfaces to the LRU's via Test Program Sets (TPS). TPS's are required to perform the automated testing and faults isolation of the Unit Under Test (UUT). A TPS consists of test software, an Interface Adapter (ITA), cables used to connect the ITA to UU, and supporting documentation.  This test station supports B-1B Radar/Electronic Warfare LRUs, and ultimately impacts B-1B mission capability for Global Attack missions. Failure to provide funding for ARTS will reduce B-1B mission capability due to non-availability of serviceable assets. The Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) presently supporting B-1B LRU troubleshooting and repair is no longer supportable due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescence caused by the age of the equipment. The average REW and DAAE mission capable rate is 67%.

Aerial Stores Lift Trucks (SEV)
The Aerial Stores Lift Trucks program will recapitalize the fleet of 3,000 and 7,000 lbs class munitions loaders in the Air Force inventory with electric and diesel variants. Its purpose is to provide a safe, expedited, and reliable means of integrating munitions to the aircraft. The MJ-1 is an air transportable, nuclear-certified lift vehicle used to transport, load, and unload stores, including munitions, fuel tanks, and pylons, suspension equipment, and ammunition weighing up to 3,000 pounds onto/into the aircraft. The MHU-83 is an air transportable, nuclear-certified hydraulically operated lift vehicle used to load conventional and nuclear weapons up to 7,000 lbs. Both vehicles can be configured with a diesel engine for persistent flight line operations or electric motor to support loading of munitions in enclosed areas without exhaust health concerns. The new MHU-83 and MJ-1 systems will replace the legacy fleet of MJ-40, MHU-174, and 8 obsolete variants of the MHU-83 and MJ-1C. The current fleet of legacy lift trucks exceed their 20 year design life and are suffering from numerous obsolescence and supportability issues. Current one-time depot overhaul lines can  not refurbish legacy systems in sufficient quantities to meet war fighter demands and serves only as a stopgap measure until recapitalization is complete. An already significantly aged fleet will continue to age leading to impacts to the operational tempo of the War fighter. Additionally this places a greater demand on the integrated product team (IPT) to source parts for an end item that was manufactured twenty to thirty years ago. Parts obsolescence continues to be a major concern for the future the 3,000 and 7,000 lbs lift vehicles.

Aircraft Replacement Support Equipment Mods (SEV)
The legacy munitions handling units (MHU) program consists of the MHU-196/M and MHU-204/M. These MHUs are unsustainable due to parts obsolescence and are experiencing uncommanded responses due to antiquated electronic and hydraulic systems as identified in the requirements documents (AF IMT 1067, Modification Proposals, Air Combat Command (ACC) 09-175 and ACC 09-176). The MHUs will be replaced by the modified MHU-196A/M and MHU-204A/M units. This program will extend the service life by assessing the structural integrity and repairing the legacy control and power system. The depot, OO-ALC, is expanding their facility production and investing in additional space, support equipment and manpower as part of depot activation. Program also alleviates part obsolescence and addresses diminishing manufacturing sources. Total non-recurring cost are for the depot activation: facilities, support equipment, and other support as required. The munitions lift trailers have met and exceeded the original service life of 20 years, and this effort is to provide an additional 20 years of service. For depot activation, PMA funding may be used for contract services in support of program office requirements, program office operations and program travel requirements. Group A kits are not required; all components parts are/will be stock listed, either by the Program Management Office, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and/or the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC). Assets are used in support of nuclear and conventional operations. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) requested a production time line of 8 years. In order to meet this, additional funding is required for depot activation. 

Items Less Than $5M (SEV, ATS, AFSC)
The Items Less Than $5 Million line procures replacement organizational and intermediate (common and peculiar) support equipment for out-of-production aircraft. Common items (used on more than one weapon system) and peculiar items (unique to one weapon system) directly support aircraft maintenance and servicing requirements. These replacement items ensure continuation of serviceable equipment over the life of a weapon system. Items for procurement include, but are not limited to, ammunition loaders, ground handling adapters, guards, and covers, spring testers, aircraft maintenance fixtures and kits, test adapter kits, transponder test sets, Common Munitions Built-in Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), maintenance stands, flight line generators, hydraulic test stands and pumping units, munitions and miscellaneous trailers, cryogenic equipment, propulsion support equipment, calibration, optical and ancillary testers, etc. These programs require Program Management Administration (PMA) for TDY and other government costs associated with program/contract required activities.

C-17 CONVERSION 
PE54214f - C-17 Strategic Airlift Squadrons (AFR-EQ): $.346M is required in FY17 to procure support equipment at Pittsburgh IAP ARS for 8 C-17 aircraft transferring from Air Force Active-Duty Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) to the Air Force Reserve as Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA); the support equipment needs to be procured as it's not being transferred with the C-17 aircraft. This FY17 action is a part of the Air Force's Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) Force Mix Option (FMO) Delta (or RGM FMO-D) that mitigates the retirement of C-130H aircraft at Pittsburgh IAP ARS with transferred C-17 aircraft. PE54121f required for an Air National Guard unit gaining C-17 aircraft as a part of RGM FMO-D to mitigate the retirement of Air National Guard C-130H aircraft.

Common Aircraft Portable Reprogramming Equipment (CAPRE)(ATS)
Common Aircraft Portable Reprogramming Equipment (CAPRE) replaces the Digital Computer System and 11 Program Loader Verifier devices in organizational and intermediate level shops. CAPRE reprograms aircraft computer software, updates threat data in electronic warfare pods, performs aircraft diagnostic troubleshooting, and supports automated technical orders. CAPRE consists of a mobile maintenance terminal, cables, interface modules, software, and Aircraft Adapter Groups (AAGs). Critical to CAPRE are the AAGs. AAGs connect CAPRE laptops, test equipment, and Line Replaceable Units (LRU) on support weapon systems. There are 10 to 26 AAGs required per CAPRE, depending on the aircraft type. Each AAG contains unique cables, connectors, interface module hardware, and software to support reprogramming LRUs. Each shop/location/platform utilizing the aircraft system requires AAGs. Mission-critical Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) and mission data files are downloaded to the CAPRE laptop for the secure bulletin board and over secure telephone units. Personnel then transport CAPRE to the weapon system and use AAGs to upload files to avionics/electronic warfare computers. The CAPRE supports the following weapon systems: A-10, B-1, B-52, C-5, C-17, C-130, CV-22, F-15, F-16, H-60, and KC-46. CAPRE is the preferred MLV for the Air Force. 

Common Operational Level Tester (COLT)(ATS)
COLT is used on B-2 and F-22 weapon systems and is Nuclear Certified. The Common Operational Level Tester (COLT) is a multiple application-based tester that allows the Air Force maintainers to perform maintenance task to verify the operational capability of aircraft armament and stores management systems/subsystems and armament components. It includes the tester unit, ancillary equipment and related software program, data and documentation. Funding for this effort will allow all obsolescent items within the tester to be updated. It also will allow updating of the software to meet Authority to Operate (ATO) conditions set in the Plan of Actions and Milestones that is coordinated with the COLT Authorizing Official.

F-15 Secondary Power Source Test Set (SPSTS) (ATS)
The F-15 Secondary Power System Test Set (SPSTS) provides organizational level fault isolation testing of the F-15C/D/E landing gear, secondary power systems, and engine starting system. The F-15 SPSTS will reduce retraction cycles from 3 to 1. It will allow test procedures to become automated and decreases maintenance time up to 50 percent. The SPSTS will replace a legacy test system that is obsolete and no longer supportable. Impact if not funded: There will be reduced testing capacity and increased maintenance cost associated with extended cycle time man-hours for F-15C/D/E models. The central gear box and jet fuel starter have been the top MICAP drivers for the F-15 in the past. There is currently no tester available that can test the modified secondary power system since the F-15 upgrade with the installation of upgraded Jet Fuel Starter/Ground Control Unit (JFS/GCU) wiring group A into F-15C/D aircraft. There are 21 critical backorders at this time and a total of 43.

Hydraulic Servicing Equipment (SEV)
The Hydraulic Servicing Equipment program will recapitalize over 44 legacy variants of hydraulic test stands in inventory. The universal hydraulic test stand (UHTS) comes in electric and diesel, 2-system and 3-system configurations, depending on aircraft and maintenance requirements. The universal hydraulic test stand (UHTS) provides pressure to aircraft hydraulic systems without running expensive engines and adds on-board hydraulic fluid purification capability to eliminate the need for standalone purifiers. To reduce the cost of ownership, simplify life cycle sustainment and improve global operations, the diesel and electric 2-system and 3-system variants share an 80-90% parts commonality and was designed with maintenance in mind. Legacy aircraft are challenged by parts obsolescence. The UHTS cleans hydraulic fluid to a higher purity than received from the manufacturer, drastically reducing the wear and tear and early age-out of aircraft component parts increasing aircraft availability and mission readiness.

Joint Service Electronic Combat Systems Tester (JSECST) (ATS)
The Joint Service Electronic Combat Systems Tester (JSECST) provides an organizational level (O-level) flight line capability for verifying the operational status of aircraft installed Electronic Combat (EC) systems including their associated installed antennas, transmission lines, radomes, cockpit displays, controls and EC suite communication buses. It also provides EC system malfunction diagnostics. The JSECST provides end-to-end (ETE) functional testing to determine the status of EC system installed in or on operational aircraft. It automatically determines the go/no-go status of the EC system with minimal technician interaction. In cases where the EC system has a critical fault, the JSECST detects the critical failure, identifies the ETE test that failed, and provides the diagnostics to isolate the failed aircraft transmission line path/component or line replaceable unit (LRU). The JSECST can be operated in automatic or manual mode to provide identification and isolation of failed EC systems. This equipment support Air Force weapon systems A-10, F-15, and F-16 aircraft. Failure to procure this item would compromise the safety of more than 53 units supporting A-10s, CV-22, F-15s, and F-16s. The JSECST is a defensive system tester, equipping the warfighter with safe and fully functional electronic combat systems.

Small Munitions Trailers (SEV)
The program provides funding for the fleet wide replacement of the legacy MHU-110 and MHU-141 munitions trailers. These munitions trailers are on average 35 years old, representing nearly 2-times their design life. As a result, these trailers face parts obsolescence and are uneconomical to repair. The MHU-110v2 munitions trailer will be a flatbed carrier capable of transporting conventional munitions with the load up to 15,000 pounds. The MHU-141v2 munitions trailer will be a flatbed carrier that is nuclear certified and capable of transporting munitions with the load up to 8,400 pounds conventional and 5,600 nuclear. Both munitions trailers are designed for temporary storage and transport of a variety of munitions and stores to support fighters and bombers in the USAF inventory. Due to similarity in form and function between the MHU-110v2 and 141v2 trailers, they will both be procured under one program effort. PMA funds will support travel requirements to meet contractual obligations. Impact Statement: An already significantly aged fleet will continue to age leading to impacts to the operational tempo of the War fighter. Additionally this places a greater demand on the integrated product team (IPT) to source parts for an end item that was manufactured twenty to thirty years ago. Parts obsolescence continues to be a major concern for the future of the 110 and 141. Based on an economic analysis, conducted by the Acquisition Cost Divisions on Robins AFB, O&amp;M cost to the field from FY12-31 is expected to be approximately $333,468,790. The total cost to replace the legacy fleet over the next ten years would be approximately $240,000,000.

The ATS described in this document were evaluated/approved by the ILCM executive agent for the Automatic Test Systems (ATS) and are in line with the USAF ATS objective. The ATS program office is focused on reducing weapon system unique ATS through replacement with a Common Versatile ATS testers that can perform similar testing across multiple weapon system platforms. The ATS Program Management Office ensures collaborative requirements planning on new ATS fielding to reduce proliferation of new weapon system unique ATS.

The ATS portfolio consists of 7,775 individually configured pieces of test equipment. The ATS division is responsible for the modernization, sustainment and recapitalization of this equipment.  Included in this portfolio are 6 nuclear certified testers. They are  B-2 &amp; B-52 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS), B-2 Common Organizational Level Tester (COLT), B-52 Multi-Use Systems Tester Armament Next Generation (MUSTANG), F-15 Armament Testers (T-198 &amp; T-199), F-16 Aircraft Circuits Preload Test Set (ACPTS), and F-16 Stores System Tester (SST). 

Requirement for cyber security:  Increased emphasis and new direction regarding cyber security of off-network information systems (platform information technology, PIT) is driving the requirement to perform certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) of new and legacy Automatic Test Systems (ATS) in order to obtain an authority-to-operate (ATO) for the system.  The new requirement to perform C&amp;A on PIT involves an analysis of system architecture and a subsequent risk-based assessment of vulnerabilities.  A mitigation plan for identified vulnerabilities is developed resulting in a Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM) for the system.  This is an engineering intensive activity.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

                    <proc:Description>The legacy munitions handling units (MHU) program consists of the MHU-196/M and MHU-204/M. These MHUs are unsustainable due to parts obsolescence and are experiencing uncommand responses due to antiquated electronic and hydraulic systems as identified in the requirements documents (AF IMT 1067, Modification Proposals, ACC 09-175 and ACC 09-176). The MHUs will be replaced by the modified MHU-196A/M and MHU-204A/M units. This program will extend the service life by assessing the structural integrity and repairing the legacy control and power system. The depot, OO-ALC, is/may be expanding their facility production and investing in additional space, support equipment and manpower as part of depot activation. Program also alleviates part obsolescence and addresses diminishing manufacturing sources. Total non-recurring cost are for the depot activation: facilities, support equipment, and other support as required. The munitions lift trailers have met and exceeded the original service life of 20 years, and this effort is to provide an additional 20 years of service. To support modification effort, PMA funding may be used for A&amp;AS support, tech data validation/verification and program travel requirements. Group A kits are not required; all components parts are/will be stock listed, either by the Program Management Office, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and/or the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC). Assets are used in support of nuclear and conventional operations. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) requested a production timeline of 8 years. In order to meet this, additional funding is required for depot activation.&amp;#13;&amp;#10;&amp;#13;&amp;#10;PMA Justification: The program team will use PMA to allow the USAF program office to assist in planning support needed to produce and install the modification, oversee the modification, evaluate engineering change proposals and help resolve technical issues. PMA will also support program management reviews (PMRs) to discuss production schedules, as well as current programmatic /technical issues and impacts to the program.  &amp;#13;&amp;#10; &amp;#13;&amp;#10;Impact if PMA not funded: Increases programmatic risk to the USAF program office by not being able to provide program support to resolve cost, schedule or technical issues in a timely manner that could result in delays. Degradation of the modification program will directly affect operational safety, suitability and effectiveness of transporting and handling conventional and nuclear munitions.

These MHUs will be replaced by the modified MHU-196A/M and MHU-204A/M units. The legacy MHUs are unsustainable due to parts obsolescence and are experiencing uncommand responses due to antiquated electronic and hydraulic systems as identified in the requirements documents (AF IMT 1067, Modification Proposals, ACC 09-175 and ACC 09-176).  The depot, OO-ALC, is/may be expanding their facility production and investing in additional space, support equipment and manpower as part of depot activation.  This modification is a service life extension program (SLEP) that will extend the service life by assessing the structural integrity and replacing the legacy control and power system with commercial programmable automation controllers. Program also alleviates part obsolescence and addresses diminishing manufacturing sources. Total Non-recurring cost are for the depot activation:  facilities, support equipment, and other support as required.  The munitions lift trailers have met and exceeded the original service life of 20 years, and this effort is to provide an additional 20 years of service.  To support modification effort, PMA funding may be used for A&amp;AS support, tech data validation/verification and program travel requirements. Group A kits are not required; all components parts are/will be stock listed, either by the Program Management Office, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and/or the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC).  Assets are used in support of nuclear and conventional operations.  Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) requested a production timeline of 8 years. In order to meet this, additional funding is required for depot activation.

PMA Justification: The program team will use PMA to allow the USAF program office to assist in planning support needed to produce and install the modification, oversee the modification, evaluate engineering change proposals and help resolve technical issues. PMA will also support program management reviews (PMRs) to discuss production schedules, as well as current programmatic /technical issues and impacts to the program.  
 
Impact if PMA not funded: Increases programmatic risk to the USAF program office by not being able to provide program support to resolve cost, schedule or technical issues in a timely manner that could result in delays. Degradation of the modification program will directly affect operational safety, suitability and effectiveness of transporting and handling conventional and nuclear munitions. This affects the support of strategic, long range bombing throughout the world. 
 
Group B Non-recurring includes the Depot activation Costs for FY14-17.  A larger facility (Bldg. 850 is required to accommodate the production required to satisfy AFGSC time line requirement of an 8 year program.  It also includes the contract issues by the depot production process and technical documentation requirements.   
Group B kits represent MHU inducted by the depot for SLEP.
Group A kits are not required; all components parts are/will be stock listed, either by the Program Management Office, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and/or the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC).
Total Non-recurring cost are for the depot activation:  facilities, support equipment, and other support as required.
 
Impact if not funded:  The program would cease to exist.  Alternate sources for production would be need to be acquired which will delay any SLEP production for at least 12-18 months. 
 
Other Government Cost includes:  Testing required for Nuclear Certification and unknown miscellaneous support/expenses associated with the Nuclear Certification.
 
Impact if Other Government Cost not funded:  Since the MLT/MHU(Munitions Lift Trailer/Munitions Handling Unit) is controlled by software and trailer are required to be nuclear certified, the lack of funding would gravely degraded the capability of the MHU mission because MHU production could not be fielded without stable software configuration and maintenance and nuclear certification.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;

Milestone/Development Status

Studies have been accomplished providing necessary technical data to extend the service life of the fleet to meet mission needs. These studies addressed obsolescence and component level repair and sustainment issues.

The program has accomplished maintainer/operator evaluation of the prototype trailer and is executing changes as a result of user feedback. Additionally, the depot started disassembly/reassembly of a legacy trailer, allowing them to create the production control documents and processes required to produce the final SLEP trailers.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>COLT is a Nuclear certified tester for B-2 and F-22 aircraft. 

The current COLT tester has supportability issues, (obsolescence and thermal), and poor reliability rates as there is an average 42% annual failure rate which drive high sustainment costs.  The gov't assumes a lot of risk with obsolescent parts, living off repairs that could abruptly end would directly impact both the F-22 and B-2 weapon systems.  Operating system update  feeds into the COLT ATO that mandates we meet cyber security measures; dated Operating System induces risk that is unacceptable.  If this effort is not funded there will be an extremely high risk of having weapon systems unable to be fitted with weapon thereby drastically increasing non-mission capable rates.


FY18 funds will be used to purchase modification kits and installation of kits for the entire COLT fleet. Funding also supports upgrades/changes to the system that are driven by cyber concerns. PMA cost cover travel for the COLT program and contractor support.

FY18 PMA dollars in the total amount of ($305,000) will be used for travel (Other Government Costs) and Contractor Services to augment ATS Division manpower to perform logistics functions as fielding of assets occur.
This program was originally included on the Items Less than $5M exhibit in the FY17 President's Budget.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>Fully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) Modification -- Formally integrates the critical Sniper Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) advanced targeting pod (ATP) capability into the B-1's internal software to meet today's mission needs - for increased situational awareness, weapons deconfliction, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance within the Combat Air Forces
(CAF) to increase overall effectiveness of the B-1 weapon system and to meet overall B-1 bomber mission requirements. The FY19 OCO approved UFR will be used to purchase (10) targeting pods, the pods have a 14 month lead time. The OCO funding will allow B-1 to meet the scheduled Required Asset Availability (RAA) date for mission effectiveness.

The legacy munitions handling units (MHU) program consists of the MHU-196/M and MHU-204/M. The MHUs will be overhauled and given a new designation: MHU-196A/M and MHU-204A/M units. This effort will provide an additional 20 years of service life by assessing the structural integrity and repairing the legacy control and power system. Program also alleviates part obsolescence and addresses diminishing manufacturing sources. Funding support the activation of the depot, OO-ALC, to expand their facility production and investing in additional space, support equipment and manpower. Total non-recurring cost are for the depot activation: facilities, support equipment, and other support as required. During depot activation, PMA funding may be used for contract services in support of the program office, program office operations and program travel requirements. Group A kits are not required; all components parts are/will be stock listed, either by the Program Management Office, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and/or the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC). Assets are used in support of nuclear and conventional operations. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) requested a production time line of 8 years. In order to meet this, additional funding is required for depot activation. Prior year funding was identified in APPN 3010, BP12, 0202834F Aircraft Replacement Support Equip and moved to APPN 3010, BP12, CLC Other Production Charges to reflect the direction to use organic depot overhaul.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Interim Contractor Support (ICS) provides maintenance and repair capability for depot-level repairs to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) operational requirements for the B-2 weapon system. The ICS program is an on-condition and limited overhaul repair capability repairing Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) associated with legacy airframe structures, hydro-mechanical components and avionics components until permanent depot repair capability is established. ICS also provides travel support and interim repair to new or modified components stemming from B-2 aircraft modification programs until a permanent source of repair has been achieved either organically or through Contractor Depot Maintenance (CDM).

This exhibit covers new B-2 modifications. ICS for legacy components is covered in Line Item 73.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>ICS will continue to provide interim maintenance and repair capability to B-2 LRUs/SRUs as well as new aircraft modification components until either an organic repair capability or contractor repair capability is established.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Interim Contractor Support (ICS) provides maintenance, and repair capability for depot-level repairs to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) operational requirements for the B-2 weapon system. The ICS program is an on-condition and limited overhaul repair capability repairing Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) associated with legacy airframe structures, hydro-mechanical components, and avionics components until permanent depot repair capability is established. ICS also provides travel support and interim repair to alternate mission equipment and new or modified components stemming from B-2 aircraft modification programs until a permanent source of repair has been achieved either organically or through Contractor Depot Maintenance (CDM).

Weapon System Support Center (WSSC) provides funds to acquire, replace, upgrade, test and integrate B-2 peculiar support equipment (PSE), Special Test Equipment (STE) and their sub-components for B-2 Software Sustainment in support of Aircraft Program Depot Maintenance, Test Ranges, and AFGSC operational support facilities. The B-2 WSSC is a one-of-a-kind facility that develops, maintains, sustains, integrates, tests, and certifies the B-2 Spirit software. The B-2 WSSC combines flight controls, radar, weapons, navigation, traffic control, communications, displays, flight management,
external interfaces, and defensive management functionality in a test environment to conduct component, subsystem, and end-to-end software tests before deployment to the test aircraft and/or the operational fleet.

Post Production Support (PPS) provides funds to acquire replace, upgrade, test, integrate and for travel support of other PSE, STE, support systems and their sub-components used in B-2 supporting Laboratories, Sustainment Depot Maintenance activities, Test Ranges and AFGSC operational support facilities.

This exhibit covers WSSC and ICS for legacy B-2 components. ICS for new B-2 components is covered by WSC b00200/B-2A Line Item #72</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>ICS will continue to provide interim maintenance and repair capability to legacy B-2 LRUs/SRUs as well as new aircraft modification components and alternate mission equipment until either an organic repair capability or contractor repair capability is established.

Post Production Support funds are used to acquire, replace, upgrade, integrate, and test obsolete B-2 Peculiar Support Equipment, Special Test Equipment and their sub-components required to support the WSSC as well as Programmed Depot Maintenance, Test Range, and AFGSC support facilities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The B-52 Combat Network Communication Technology (CONECT) acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with data link and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade installs new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade installs on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, email and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) data link to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite, when produced and installed, will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of military operations the B-52 is assigned. 
  
This modification is planned to be done in conjunction with Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM).  In addition, training devices will be upgraded to include CONECT functionality to meet user training requirements.

Post Production Support funds Interim Contract Support (ICS) until the depot is established for CONECT.  

This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding in PE 0101113F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>1.) The Engine Depot Stock &amp; Preservation Kit buy provides initial spares to support depot operations during the transition from the Maintenance Service Rate Plan (MSRP)/Globemaster Integrated Sustainment Program (GISP) overhaul construct to the Engine Sustainment Services (ESS)/GISP overhaul construct. This follows a Secretary of the Air Force (Sec AF) directive to procure engine sustainment outside of the GISP Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract.  

2.) Cargo Load Trainer - The Cargo Load Trainer (CLT) Model trains Loadmasters to safely load a C-17 aircraft.  The intent is to modify and/or procure Cargo Load Trainer Model(s) (CLTs) to support Loadmaster training.  This can be achieved by using physical or virtual solutions. 

3.) Purchase of Peculiar and Common Support Equipment for the C-17 (PSE and CSE). CSE is comprised of support equipment used by the C-17 and other programs, while PSE is unique to the C-17. Both are required to effectively operate the Organizational and Intermediate (O&amp;I) levels of aircraft maintenance at Main Operating Bases (MOBs), Avionics Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs), Engine RMCs, Enroute locations, Backshop activities, plus requirements in support of the Boeing Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) and WR (Warner Robins)-ACI Global Reach Improvement Program (GRIP) contracts.

4.) The Post Production Product Improvement (PPPI) program funds Materiel Improvement Program (MIP) projects. MIP projects correct Deficiency Report (DR) issues that were discovered during the aircraft production phase. There have been over 275 projects incorporated into production aircraft. About 38 projects remain to be retrofitted to post production aircraft to bring them up to production aircraft configuration. The projects are worked in conjunction with aircraft heavy maintenance (depot) cycle every 5/6 years. 
Funds remaining in the FYDP will be used to complete PPPI projects initiated with APAF.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401130F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>1.) Engine Depot Stock &amp; Preservation Kit buy - This is required due to the Secretary of the Air Force's (Sec AF) directive to breakout F117 engine overhaul outside of the GISP CLS umbrella.  This requires the purchase of initial spares in order for the depots to operate effectively.

2.) Cargo Load Trainer - The current CLT Model is 20 years old and needs to be repaired, refurbished, or replaced. 

3.) Purchase of Peculiar and Common Support Equipment for the C-17 (PSE and CSE) - If not funded, C-17 operational readiness and aircraft availability will be impacted negatively. In addition, the safety of maintenance and shop personnel working will be put in harm's way.    

4.) Post Production Product Improvement Program (PPPI) - The FY19 budget supports PPPI for 21 MIP projects to be installed on 35 aircraft.  MIP projects significantly increase aircraft Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RM&amp;A).  Project completion also contributes to the common configuration and reducing the lifecycle costs of the C-17 fleet.  MIP projects include, but not limited to:
a.) Redesign Wing Fillet Panel 
b.) 1553 Data Bus Pre-Electrical Power Improvement Retrofit 
c.) Pneumatic Manifold Slip Joint Leakage 
d.) Lavatory Drain Leak 
e.) Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter 
f.) AC Pack Refrigeration Unit Reliability
g.) Spoiler Bushings and Bearings</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The F-15C/D Eagle is a highly maneuverable all-weather air superiority fighter. The F-15E Strike Eagle retains the basic air-to-air capability of the F-15C/D Eagle, but adds a weapon systems operator (WSO), rear cockpit, conformal fuel tanks and advanced systems for all-weather, day/night, all-altitude, deep penetration air-to-surface attack.

F-15 E Integrated Aircrew Trainers (IATs) PE 0207134F, A FY19 new start.

F-15 E Integrated Aircrew Trainers (IATs) funded in PE 0207134F, supports the procurement of additional IATs in order to better implement formal syllabus training, and meet HAF intent by preparing for 20% increase in FTU production IAW ACC/A3T memo dated 29 Jun 2016. Future training plans include moving all Computer Based Training (CBTs) from desktop PCs to the IATs for increased fidelity and reduced Subject Matter Expert (SME) hours when teaching basic avionics use in IATs and Mission Training Center (MTC) events. Allows additional time to concentrate on systems integration and crew coordination, further supporting HAF intent. $4.959M P3A in BP11 for IATs was created for this work; funding erroneously loaded in BP11 

The program continues post-production support of the F-15C/D and F-15E Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) and post production support for the F-15 tooling storage.  

Provides continued support of post production tooling storage at Granite City, IL. This equipment is used for the manufacture, test, support, or repair of the F-15 aircraft and/or its associated system components. The retention of Special Tooling/Special Test Equipment (ST/STE) is based on past usage history, current spare/repair parts contracts, and projections for future requirements.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency response, and providing military support to civil authorities. 
No Research Development Test and Evaluation funding is associated with this effort.

Funds may be used to address Diminishing manufacturing Sources (DMS) efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. 
DMSMS costs are included in Group B NRE; SE/PM costs are include in the Group B recurring; and Depot Costs are included in the Support Equipment.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>F-15 E Integrated Aircrew Trainers (IATs) PE 0207134F, A FY19 new start.
IATs Funding provides continued support of the Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS). Grounding of aircraft would result without this repair support.
Tooling is loaned/leased to support manufacturing of spares, as well as to support the execution of modification programs, life extension activities, and sustainment efforts.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The F-15C/D Eagle is a highly maneuverable all-weather air superiority fighter. The F-15E Strike Eagle retains the basic air-to-air capability of the F-15C/D Eagle, but adds a weapon systems operator (WSO), rear cockpit, conformal fuel tanks and advanced systems for all-weather, day/night, all-altitude, deep penetration air-to-surface attack.

F-15 E Integrated Aircrew Trainers (IATs) PE 0207134F, A FY19 new start.
F-15 E Integrated Aircrew Trainers (IATs) funded in PE 0207134F, supports the procurement of additional IATs in order to better implement formal syllabus training, and meet HAF intent by preparing for 20% increase in FTU production IAW ACC/A3T memo dated 29 Jun 2016.  Future training plans include moving all Computer Based Training (CBTs) from desktop PCs to the IATs for increased fidelity and reduced Subject Matter Expert (SME) hours when teaching basic avionics use in IATs and Mission Training Center (MTC) events. Allows additional time to concentrate on systems integration and crew coordination, further supporting HAF intent.

The program continues post-production support of the F-15C/D and F-15E Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) and post production support for the F-15 tooling storage.  

Provides continued support of post production tooling storage at Granite City, IL. This equipment is used for the manufacture, test, support, or repair of the F-15 aircraft and/or its associated system components. The retention of Special Tooling/Special Test Equipment (ST/STE) is based on past usage history, current spare/repair parts contracts, and projections for future requirements.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency response, and providing military support to civil authorities. 
No Research Development Test and Evaluation funding is associated with this effort.

Funds may be used to address Diminishing manufacturing Sources (DMS) efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. 
DMSMS costs are included in Group B NRE; SE/PM costs are include in the Group B recurring; and Depot Costs are included in the Support Equipment.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program, Item Integrated Aircrew Trainers, is a new start.

Funding provides continued support of the Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS). Grounding of aircraft would result without this repair support. 

Supports procurement of additional F-15 E Integrated Aircrew Trainers (IATs) to better implement formal syllabus training, and meets HAF intent by preparing for 20% increase in FTU production IAW ACC/A3T memo dated 29 Jun 2016.

Provides continued interim contractor support of post production tooling storage at Granite City, IL. Tooling is loaned/leased to support manufacturing of spares, as well as to support the execution of modification programs, life extension activities, and sustainment efforts.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Provides funding for F-16 support equipment, facilities support, interim contractor support, PMA costs and production line shutdown activities for F-16 aircraft.

Funding for this exhibit is budgeted in PE 0207133F</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This appropriation is for the continuation of prime contractor post production support, procurement of deferred peculiar ground support equipment, peculiar training equipment, mission support, interim contract support, and activities associated with F-16 production line shutdown.

The USG stores tooling identified as required to be re-utilized to manufacture spares, support aircraft modifications, or other purposes. It would require millions of dollars to re-manufacture these tools and the delivery lead-time of the required tool/part would take several years to reproduce. Funding for these contracts is essential since the F-16 Program Offices require specialized engineering services to ensure continued fleet support capability during, and beyond, the Production Line Shutdown (PLS). The requirement is annual funding to maintain the Electronic Tool Inventory Management System (eTIMS) in cooperation with the Lexes Inc. and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Inc, as well as the actual teardown, shipping and storage of unique aircraft manufacturing equipment.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Funding will procure necessary support equipment and mission critical replenishment spares commensurate to the F-22's projected service life (2055+). The Raptor is the USAF's top priority for ensuring air dominance in support of Joint Forces' operational access and homeland defense for the next 40+ years. The F-22 is the first operational multi-mission fighter that combines stealth, super cruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the most capable anti-access, area denial combat aircraft.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207138F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The F-22 funding will procure the following requirements, but is not limited to those listed below: 

Next Generation Polyalphaolefin Carts (NextGen PAO Carts, required to cool and protect aircraft avionics systems during ground maintenance/operation. Continuous production of the carts is required to replace existing carts suffering operational shortages due to diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) issues resulting in increasing budgets to repair and extended duty hours to maintain required levels of operational carts.

F-22A Mission Critical Replenishment Spares (MCRS) commensurate with the fleet flying hour program. Spares include landing gear, leading edge flaps, wings, horizontal stabilizers, etc.  Spares support the entirety of the F-22A fleet including those required for critical reversion repairs and mishap aircraft. The majority of these spares are long-lead  items with a diminishing manufacturing base.

Replacement of failing and unsupportable contractor-owned automated test stations used solely for the F-22 power supplies with an automated test station from the organic catalog of automatic test stations. This ensures long-term support and protection against further DMS issues. 

Funding may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, respond to field support equipment issues, and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other mandates to ensure continued aircrew safety maintenance capability and mission effectiveness.</proc:Justification>

-F-16 Block 40/50 Mission Training Center (MTC), funded in PE 0207701F, supports the procurement of high fidelity, Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable flight simulators for F-16 Block 40 and 50 weapon systems. Each MTC includes multiple high-fidelity Simulator Cockpits, Instructor Operator Stations, a Threat Server and Brief/Debrief and Mission Observation capability. Each is capable of linking to geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. Allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic level of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training. 

- In FY19, PE 0207701F provides funds to procure eight man-in-the-loop threat simulators for the Nellis Virtual Test and Training Center (VTTC). The VTTC requires four high and four lower fidelity man-in-the-loop simulators to meet Nellis' Virtual Warfare Center tactics development and training requirements. The trainers will be DMO capable and platform agnostic, to allow integration with other Mission Design Series. The simulator fidelity is designed to provide adversary threats for testing of 4th or 5th generation platforms. While not designed for this purpose, these trainers could provide virtual adversary-air support in operational training.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

            <proc:Description>RQ-4 post production 3010 Budget Program (BP) 13 funding will support sensor procurement and related activities, production line shutdown and disposition activities, the procurement and fielding of the Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP), Integrated Functional Capabilities programs, as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power initiatives. 

Funds will support the procurement and installation of MS-177A multi-spectral Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, auxiliary equipment B-kits, support equipment, sensor calibration flights, training, data, Interim Contractor Support (ICS), and other costs to complete the fielding of the sensors. Fairings and sensor windows will also be procured in support of the sensors. The B-kits consist of the Sensor Interface Modules (SIM), airborne file servers, tooling, and other related equipment. The Program Office awarded a contract to integrate the MS-177 onto the RQ-4 in early FY16. To date, there are preliminary DT results available. Additional results will be available following completion of testing.

Funds will support Global Hawk costs relating to the shut down of the production line. Costs include production equipment disposition, contract closeout, mission support, production closeout costs, and other related costs. Funds may also be utilized for the procurement of Optical Bar Camera (OBC) SIMs, equipment, and all associated costs with the delivery and install of the SIMs. Neither the MS-177 nor the OBC are replacing systems currently flown on the RQ-4. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305220F. The flyaway unit cost is not included on P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits. Funding may be used to address DMS issues for which there are not sufficient Government spares and/or the ability to repair organically or commercially is not viable.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY19 RQ-4 sensor funding will support the activities necessary to complete the procurement and installation of MS-177A sensors and auxiliary equipment B-kits. Funds to be used for ICS, focus flight tests, support equipment, training, data, and other activities required to complete the fielding of the sensors.  The B-kits consist of the SIMs, airborne file servers, tooling, and other related equipment. Funds may be used for sensor initiatives.

FY19 RQ-4 post-production funds may also be used for production equipment disposition, contract closeout, sustaining engineering ramp down, mission support, production closeout costs, DMS resolution, and other related costs.

No Budget Year FY19 funding requested for the Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) under CLC RQ-4 PPS.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The CV-22 is the US Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the joint multi-mission V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. The aircraft provides long-range infiltration, exfiltration, and re-supply of SOF in politically sensitive and hostile/denied areas. The Navy is the lead service for the joint V-22 program and has overall responsibility for managing all V-22 variants, including the Air Force CV-22 variant. 

CV-22 post production support funding enables the seamless transition from the production phase of the program to the operations and support (O&amp;S) phase. Post Production support funding is required to procure support equipment and integrated logistics support (ILS) requirements affiliated with sustainment of CV-22 modifications to improve operational effectiveness, readiness, and aircraft availability of the worldwide CV-22 fleet.

            <proc:Description>1.  The Air Force Industrial Preparedness program element combines the resources of several appropriations (Aircraft Procurement, Missile Procurement, and Operation and Maintenance) to create a comprehensive program that aids in ensuring the defense industry can supply reliable, affordable systems to operational commanders.  The Aircraft Procurement part of Industrial Preparedness support 1) management and upkeep of government-owned industrial plants; 2) management of industrial base assessments; 3) environmental compliance and pollution prevention at government-owned industrial plants.

2. Four basic activities are funded in this appropriation: Industrial Facilities, Industrial Base Assessments, Environmental Compliance, and Pollution Prevention.

Industrial Facility Capital Type Rehabilitation cost element (MPC 3000): Provides for repair and expansion, major capital rehabilitation, construction, demolition, equipment, property appraisals and energy conservation at government-owned, contractor-operated industrial facilities.  These plants are the backbone of defense weapon system assembly and maintenance for the B-2, U-2, F-16, F-15SA, P-3 C-130, C-5B, RQ-4 Global Hawk, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter &amp; classified programs.

Industrial Base Assessment cost element (MPC 6000): Provides for the identification, analysis and assessment of industrial base concerns dealing with aircraft research and development, production, and sustainment.  These assessments provide timely and accurate industrial base information to support Air Force decisions on 1) aircraft weapon system acquisition risks; 2) budget allocation investments; 3) weapon system sustainment and logistics support; and 4) defense industry mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.  Supports joint-Service industrial base planning on shared commodities, technologies, and facilities.

Environmental Compliance cost element (MPC 7000) provides for the efforts needed to maintain compliance with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements regarding operation of the government-owned contractor-operated industrial facilities. The environmental compliance program includes efforts to enhance compliance through pollution prevention reducing controlled emissions and use of hazardous materials.

Pollution Prevention activities (MPC 6044) at USAF industrial government owned, contractor operated (GOCO) facilities to reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  Activities include demonstration and validation of improved processes, materials and equipment that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and weapon systems life cycle costs.  Also included are energy conservation initiatives, pollution prevention opportunity assessments; and recovery/recycling to minimize hazardous waste.  These activities reduce risk to performance, schedule, and cost of the facilities and weapon systems.  These activities support the Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Order 13693, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&amp;L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Funding for Poll Prevention moved to PE 78011F in FY16 and beyond.  Prior to FY15, these funds were provided through PE 078054F.  In FY19 moved from BP19 to BP14.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The C-130J is a medium-size transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 ft.) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity compared with legacy C-130Hs and the C-130J (short).  

Other variants of the USAF C-130J fleet are short-bodied aircraft and include the EC-130J (airborne psychological operations), WC-130J (weather reconnaissance), HC-130J (combat search and rescue), MC-130J (special operations), and the AC-130J (close air support and armed reconnaissance).


Program funding includes Diminishing Manufacturing Sources.

            <proc:Description>This program provides funding for the procurement of initial/replacement War Consumables and includes commodities such as Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammers (MALD-J), Fiber Optic Towed Decoys (FOTD), and Rocket-Assisted Take-Off (RATO) motors. These items support War Reserve Materiel (WRM) requirements and fleet inventory objectives across multiple weapon systems. 

DESCRIPTION: 
The Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and Jammer (MALD-J) configurations are key enablers supporting Air Force Global Strike, Global Response, Space and C4ISR, and Air and Space Expeditionary Force Concepts of Operation. MALD is a low cost, powered, expendable decoy designed to represent the kinematics and radar signature characteristics of various combat aircraft. The MALD will be employed from various aircraft platforms to stimulate, saturate, and deceive integrated air defense systems (IADS) thus increasing the survivability of strike aircraft. MALD production is complete and transitioned to sustainment. MALD-J is currently in production and is the DODs only stand-in jamming capability for Airborne Electronic Attack Systems. MALD-J is designed to degrade or deny the IADS detection of friendly aircraft or munitions, and is able to operate in both decoy and jammer modes. 

The MALD program plans to use some funds to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues, obsolescence issues, and reliability improvements, including flight testing. FY18 is the final year of MALD funding.

DESCRIPTION:
The ALE-70 Towed Decoy is a countermeasures dispenser system designed to fit into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft. The ALE-70 provides aircraft self-protection against radar guided missiles.  Funds procure all system components: decoys, canisters, and explosive cartridges to deploy the decoys.

DESCRIPTION:
Items Less Then $5M: The Rocket-Assisted Take-Off (RATO) motor is a solid propellant rocket used to provide launching thrust to the Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) drone (BQM-167).  Support items include reefing line cutters, igniters, and initiators. The RATO and the associated support items are single use items.

The OC-135B aircraft supports the implementation of the United States Government (USG) Open Skies Treaty. Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U)" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.

This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.

OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&amp;E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>The P5 Combat Training System (P5CTS) provides instrumentation to train aircrews in air-to-air, air-to-ground, and ground-to-air combat under simulated combat conditions in any available airspace worldwide and eliminates the need to fly over highly instrumented ground ranges.  The system used on-aircraft instrumentation (the P5 pod), communication links, and a ground station to support range safety, training execution, and aircrew debriefings.  The system is in sustainment, with an estimated lifecycle through 2030.  ACC has established a requirement for additional pods to meet training requirements through that lifecycle.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207134F.

The F-15E is a twin engine, two seat, supersonic dual-role, day/night, all-weather, deep interdiction fighter with multi-role air-to-air capabilities.  F-15E Radar Modernization Program (RMP), designated the APG-82(V)1, replaces 217 legacy F-15E radars with an active electronically scanned array radar, using existing technology from other DOD platforms.  It solves parts obsolescence problems and provides improved reliability and performance, including air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. It also provides for future growth.

These funds will be used to support depot stand-up/activation for the F-15E APG-82(V)1 radar, also known as the Radar Modernization Program (RMP).</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>The UH-1N is a 45+ year old helicopter and requires work to address concerns identified within multiple studies which will prevent aircraft groundings.  This program will accomplish a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for a portion of the UH-1N fleet to address issues with this aging fleet, e.g., structural repairs, replacement of key systems based on structural fatigue, system obsolescence and a diminishing manufacturing industrial base.  Additionally, this effort will address safety requirements; Federal Aviation Administration, DoD and engineering mandates; and configuration changes.  This effort includes funding for the UH-1N System Program Office (e.g., A&amp;AS, support, travel).  The funds budgeted over the FYDP will enable the SLEP of up to 63 aircraft required to meet mission requirements until a UH-1N replacement helicopter can be fielded.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>This budget item covers pollution prevention activities at USAF industrial 
government owned, contractor operated (GOCO) facilities to reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  Activities include demonstration and validation of improved processes, materials and equipment that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and weapon systems life cycle costs.  Also included are energy conservation initiatives, pollution prevention opportunity assessments; and recovery/recycling to minimize hazardous waste.  These activities reduce risk to performance, schedule, and cost of the facilities and weapon systems.  These activities support the Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Order 13693, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&amp;L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F in FY16 and beyond.  Prior to FY15, these funds were provided through PE 078054F.

Note this activity moved from BP19 to BP14 beginning FY19.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability.  ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

FY17 OCO funds $8.4M was used for procurement modification on the Advanced Targeting Pods to add Eye-Safe Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search. Eye-safe Laser Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search is essential for protection of US ground and coalition forces during the combat identification process.  The capability will prevent  potential eye damage to friendly forces during ID of targets in urban Environments.

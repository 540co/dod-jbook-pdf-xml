                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project focuses on four major efforts: 1) High Power Microwave Lethality Prototype testing, testing and modeling will be performed to ascertain the vulnerabilities of critical electrical circuits and components in order to attack adversary systems, such as unmanned aerial systems, and to protect U.S. assets and infrastructure in use by the Warfighter; 2) Advanced Electronic/Environmental Control Unit Thermal Management Prototypes of different sizes will be built and tested to reduce the magnitude of fuel used at forward operating bases consumed by environmental control units to keep major electronic systems cool in austere environments.  Prototypes will be used to fully evaluate distributed cooling and legacy approaches; 3) Technology Complex Compound Materials for Thermal/Energy Management prototypes will be manufactured and tested for suitability in high velocity impacts.  The planned compound is Coordinative Molecular Bond Armor Material and has potential to provide ballistics and thermal protection; 4) Upgrades are planned for the Advanced Measurement Optical Range facility to support laser radar development and testing; 5) HardWare-In-the-Loop (HWIL) for both open-loop device characterization and closed-loop dynamic hardware-in-the-loop simulation to characterize guidance and track-loop performance.  Simulate trajectories, and engagement would be utilized to drive the HWIL simulations (e.g. 3DOF, 6DOF); 6) Integration of a Fire Control (FC) for the near-term Long-Range Weapon System requirements for initial operational capability. Long range hypersonic weapon analysis, integration and fielding support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project TR5 funds United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/ Army Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop the associated operational prototyping, experimentation, operational analysis, and modeling and simulation in support of missile defense capabilities for current and future Forces.

USASMDC/ARSTRAT: Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for ground-based midcourse defense (GMD), the Army integrator for global missile defense, and the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) of the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense. As the Army proponent GMD, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conducting warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identifying capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and developing Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to realize the GMD capabilities. As the Army integrator for global missile defense, USASMDC/ ARSTRAT is responsible for reviewing programs managed by the Army, other Services, Defense agencies and National agencies to ensure that they are correctly synchronized and will ultimately provide the capabilities required by USSTRATCOM to execute its global missile defense responsibilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in FY 2020, the Army Long-Range Persistent Surveillance (ALPS) system efforts transition to Program Element 0604741A, Project 126.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding in this program supports Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) efforts to conduct operational realistic assessments of Army Integrated Fires performance, identify system vulnerabilities, and develop mitigations against threats across the Cyber and Electromagnetic spectrum. Army radars and sensors, integrated air and missile defense mission command and fire control, Radio Frequency (RF) data and voice networks, and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) technology will be assessed against current and postulated threat systems and techniques. Potential solutions developed by the Army, other Services, and Defense agencies (for example Missile Defense Agency) to close identified gaps will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated CEMA environments. Assessment events will be conducted approximately every two years.  Implementation of potential solutions will occur between events using system-specific funding. The proposed solutions will then be assessed at the next event after implementation.

Included in this line are funds to plan and execute periodic CEMA activities with Army Integrated Fires systems, to include other Service and other Agency radar and sensor systems as appropriate.  Upon completion of CEMA demonstration analyses, funding will facilitate initial recommendations for potential mitigations and solutions to Army sensors, C2, and RF data link vulnerabilities. Efforts in this program will also develop tools for use by Army radar and sensor  systems to improve overall system performance in contested environments, to include effects-based CEMA Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) to assess Army CEMA concepts in Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) environment.  Additionally, virtual models of critical hardware and software are being developed and implemented to allow for destructive testing with advanced CEMA threats in a lab environment. There will be continual interface with intelligence communities to maintain cognizance of emerging CEMA threats and incorporate these threats in future CEMA demonstrations. These activities follow a time-phased roadmap that identifies the investments needed to improve the resiliency of Army radar and sensors, C2, and RF data and voice networks in contested CEMA environments.

FY 2021 base funding of $26.482 million will be used to plan and execute the FY 2021 Survivability Exercise to assess the performance of the Army Integrated Fires architecture, with Joint participants, in a live, tactically relevant, contested CEMA environment. Funds will be used to analyze the performance data of the FY 2021 Survivability Exercise participant weapon systems, identify vulnerabilities, and develop rapid mitigation concepts. Additionally, the funds will be used to execute Cyber Table Tops, continue the development of virtualized critical hardware and software, conduct destructive cyber vulnerability assessments, and integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning into weapon systems to mitigate current and future CEMA threats.  FY 2021 OCO funding of $.500 million will be used to complete operational assessment of ALPS prototype systems in support of a Combatant Commander.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides for the Concept Exploration and Refinement of Terrain Shaping Obstacles and develops modernized alternatives to the Family of Scatterable Mines systems.

Project 606 Countermine/Barrier Advanced Development enables development and evaluation of technologies that will perform detection, neutralization, and clearing of landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) at operational speeds. The Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system is a suite of four capabilities for use by route clearance patrols to provide standoff detection of explosive hazards:  vehicle-mounted anomaly detection; pinpoint explosive hazard detection; explosive hazard vapor and particle detection; and remote visualization.  FREHD increases the rate of advance of the route clearance formation while removing Soldiers and equipment from the proximity of blast and fragmentation.

Project BU5 Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) provides an Anti-Vehicle (AV) capability to address the Army's directed close tactical obstacle capability gap and has been identified as a part of the Army Modernization Strategy. SAVO will utilize a Middle Tier of Acquisition approach for Rapid Prototyping and Fielding in accordance with Section 804 of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  SAVO supports a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) ONS # 18-22702 as well as a revision to the Multiple Delivery Mine System (Volcano) Joint Service Operational Requirement (JSOR) # 0683. This capability will allow for a formation of pre-emplaced directed obstacles that can be initiated remotely via fielded wired or wireless initiation systems. If the emplaced obstacle is not initiated, SAVO can be recovered for future re-deployment. SAVO consists of a newly developed base plate from which the existing stock of National Landmine Policy compliant munitions (M87A1 Volcano canisters) can be launched. SAVO can be initiated via three fielded systems; the M7 Spider Networked Munition System, the MK152/M156 Remote Activation Munition Systems (RAMS), or the CD450-4J Blasting Machine. Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding resources the continued execution of the SAVO Rapid Prototyping activities in preparation for transition to the Rapid Fielding phase.

Project EK7 Area Denial Capability Development provides for the advanced capability development of terrain shaping obstacle systems and develops modernized alternatives to the Family of Scatterable Mines.  The project will evaluate integrated technologies and develop prototype systems in a realistic operating environment for the next generation of Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO).  TSO will deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action in a joint, multi-domain, high-intensity conflict while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battle space.  TSO may include multiple methods of defeat to include top attack and bottom attack and provide controlled scalable effects against mounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, delay or block their ability to maneuver.  TSO enables the Combatant Commander to shape the battle space without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement.  This capability supports Army Modernization priorities as a critical enabler for soldier lethality and creates targets for long range precision fires within the engagement area.  TSO will utilize an open system and modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.  TSO supports a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) # 18-22702.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project BU5 Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) provides an Anti-Vehicle (AV) capability to address the Army's directed close tactical obstacle capability gap and has been identified as a part of the Army Modernization Strategy. SAVO will utilize a Middle Tier of Acquisition approach for Rapid Prototyping and Fielding in accordance with Section 804 of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  SAVO supports a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) ONS # 18-22702 as well as a revision to the Multiple Delivery Mine System (Volcano) Joint Service Operational Requirement (JSOR) # 0683. This capability will allow for a formation of pre-emplaced directed obstacles that can be initiated remotely via fielded wired or wireless initiation systems. If the emplaced obstacle is not initiated, SAVO can be recovered for future re-deployment. SAVO consists of a newly developed base plate from which the existing stock of National Landmine Policy compliant munitions (M87A1 Volcano canisters) can be launched. SAVO can be initiated via three fielded systems; the M7 Spider Networked Munition System, the MK152/M156 Remote Activation Munition Systems (RAMS), or the CD450-4J Blasting Machine. Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding resources the continued execution of the SAVO Rapid Prototyping activities in preparation for transition to the Rapid Fielding phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EK7 Area Denial Capability Development provides for the advanced capability development of terrain shaping obstacle systems and develops modernized alternatives to the Family of Scatterable Mines.

The project will evaluate integrated technologies and develop prototype systems in a realistic operating environment for the next generation of Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO).  TSO will deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action in a joint, multi-domain, high-intensity conflict while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battle space.  TSO may include multiple methods of defeat to include top attack and bottom attack and provide controlled scalable effects against mounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, delay or block their ability to maneuver.  TSO enables the Combatant Commander to shape the battle space without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement.  This capability supports Army Modernization priorities as a critical enabler for soldier lethality and creates targets for long range precision fires within the engagement area.  TSO will utilize an open system and modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.  TSO supports a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) # 18-22702.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Dominating Mobility through Terrain Shaping and Engagement (DMTTS&amp;E) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) on 3 October 2014.  The DMTTS&amp;E ICD documents Terrain Shaping Obstacle (TSO) capabilities at all operational ranges including those within line-of-sight and those that are beyond line-of-sight.  The Army completed an Analysis of Alternatives and intends to initially develop a hand-emplaced Top Attack capability to be fielded at close operational ranges.  The Army previously awarded two initiatives which developed and demonstrated prototypes of the top attack system concept.  The Army will award a single contract to complete development and qualification of the initial top attack capability.  To achieve the full capability, the Army intends to develop an improved top attack capability followed by a modernized bottom attack capability.  The top attack and bottom attack systems will then be integrated and networked through the full network capability development.  The munitions developed during the top attack and bottom attack phases will serve as the basis for the future mid-range and deep-range employed TSO capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Screening Obscuration Module (SOM) program will transition from Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) to the Production and Deployment phase in Fiscal Year 2020.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>SOM will increase platform survivability and soldier protection levels of maneuver forces by degrading enemy forces ability to detect United States targets.  The use of battlefield obscuration is a time-tested military tactic to protect personnel, vehicles, equipment, and structures from detection; and to screen the locations, activities, and actions of friendly forces. Commanders who employ obscuration enjoy greater tactical success, freedom of maneuver, and force protection. The SOM assists the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) in retaining freedom of maneuver, conducting breaching operations, breaking contact with the enemy during security operations, and deceiving the enemy of the BCT's intentions. The SOM accomplishes this by degrading enemy forces ability to detect U.S. targets in the visual and near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The SOM will provide a man portable mountable and dismountable medium area visual screening obscuration capability that can be applied to manned combat platforms and unmanned robotic systems. The individual Soldier or team will employ the SOM devices on open and complex terrain as part of cross-domain obscuration effects synchronized with land and air maneuver during cross-domain windows of advantage. 

Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Integrated Early Warning (IEW) requirements detailed in PACOM ONS 17-22580 (HQDA validated in Jan 2018). The capability developed in support of ONS 17-22580 will provide enhancements and integrated CBRN defense sensors to provide early warning of CBRN attacks and events, supplemented with decision support software. Increasing the level of confidence of information to the Commander, facilitating their ability to make critical time sensitive decisions with high confidence and low regret to mitigate and manage the impacts of CBRN hazards.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Screening Obscuration Module (SOM):  The SOM acquisition strategy is a single-step System Integration and Development (SID) phase leading to a Milestone C production decision.  A Full and Open Cost Plus Incentive Fee competitive contract was awarded and will be used to develop the SOM during the SID phase.  Fixed Price Incentive (Successive Targets) options for production were included in the contract. The acquisition strategy includes system development and demonstration, full system integration, design for producibility and demonstration of interoperability, safety, military utility and reliability.

CBRN IEW:  The $12.2 million in FY 2019, will address this rapid capability development, cyber security, qualification and performance test and evaluation (T&amp;E) efforts. This funding will yield a Capability and Limitation Report in 1Q FY 2020 to support the deployment of the Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2Q FY 2020</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program Element encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions for small, medium and large caliber munitions, tank ammunition, mortar ammunition, cannon artillery ammunition, and close combat system items.  These Projects will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of United States maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats. To achieve this, Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition projects will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.

Project 694 Medium Caliber Ammunition: This Project supports development of 30x113 millimeter (mm) self-destructing airburst munitions and qualify 30x113mm linked ammunition for ground vehicles. Increase precision and lethality capability to defeat personnel and materiel targets as well as support the Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement (JUONS) CC-0558 Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) to counter the rapidly evolving threat of Unmanned Aerial Systems. This effort will qualify the links for use with existing M788 and M789 ammunition and develop self-destructing and airburst capable munitions fired from the Lightweight 30x113mm Link Fed Chain Gun.  There is no Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 request.

Project BQ4 155mm Artillery Propulsion: Supercharge is a stand-alone top-zone 155 millimeter (mm) propelling charge required to achieve maximum range requirements from the XM1299A1 Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH). It will achieve lethality overmatch out to 70 kilometers (km) with developmental extended range projectiles, and will increase range with legacy projectiles by thirty percent. Supercharge is composed of combustible cartridge case (foamed celluloid or felted fiber technology), integral metal Stub Case, electrically initiated primer, and advanced artillery propellant. FY 2021 funding will support design risk reduction and prototype maturation efforts for two parallel Supercharge variants (2-piece bag and cased) to support the concurrent development of ERCA Increment 1C and ERCA Increment 2 (with added automated loading system), which directly supports the Army's Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross Functional Team (CFT) priority in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Project EB8 OWL for Small Caliber: The OWL project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 caliber munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability, and increasing lethality by incorporating Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) technology into the new tracer ammunition. 7.62mm and 5.56mm are the immediate focus followed by a similar development strategy for .50 caliber cartridges. There is no FY 2021 funding request.

Project EB9 Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM) supports the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the AAECM to include the XM215 Flare and XM20 Radio Frequency (RF) expendables. These expendable countermeasures systems are essential parts of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts are coordinated with Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation to address the AAECM capability, a critical enabler for the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) - Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) CFT within the Army's top modernization priorities.

These advanced decoys will address deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. This program will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will demonstrate component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major Army aircraft platforms. FY 2021 includes initial developmental/operational testing on XM215 and RF Countermeasures (CM).

Project EC2 ADVAP:  The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) Initial Capability Document (ICD) which outlines the requirements for new ammunition to support the rapid prototyping/development of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) under the Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) authority for rapid prototyping/rapid fielding. New ADVAP ammunition is designed to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.

The Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition is split into two initial variants, the General Purpose (GP) and the Special Purpose (SP). The nomenclature for the GP ammunition is XM1186 and the nomenclature for the SP ammunition is XM1184. The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) ammunition to defeat hard targets.  There is no FY 2021 funding request.

Project EC3 Ammunition Logistics Prototyping: This Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. FY 2021 funding will be used to reduce device cost and establish an alternate source for monitoring devices, as well as, verifying that issues found during testing have been resolved. FY 2021 funding will also be used to demonstrate a suite of monitoring technologies, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability.

Project EL7 Reduced Range Ammunition: The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. There is no funding requested in FY 2021.

Project EU3 .50 Caliber APTC: The APTC project is a critical technology development in response to the .50 caliber Munitions Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of APTC is to deliver a single round that replaces and improves current legacy .50 caliber ammunition. The APTC will be compatible with all Army .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M2 Machine Guns. There is no FY 2021 funding request.

Project FA5 APWM:  The APWM is focused on advanced risk mitigation, technology integration, prototyping, and product support to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems within a complex system of systems environment. The APWM Project reinforces the National Defense Strategy's major lines of effort through technology development and prototyping, which increases lethality and ensures future combat overmatch success of the Joint Force against peer/near-peer adversaries. This project also aims to improve program performance and affordability for multiple weapons and munitions Programs of Record (PoRs) via Joint Lethality Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) and Army M-Code Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinated efforts. The APWM Project directly supports top Army Modernization Priorities via the Assured-PNT (A-PNT) and LRPF CFT imperatives in support of the National Defense Strategy.  FY 2021 funding will support engagement by Weapons and Munitions PNT experts in the development, evaluation, and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's M-Code GPS, Army's PNT related programs, and A-PNT CFT programs in support of LRPF and Counter Area Access/Area Denial missions. Funding will also enable component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a NavWar system-of-systems environment, Army M-Code GPS technology integration and evaluation, planning for next generation M-Code GPS integration into the Long Range-Precision Guidance Kit (LR-PGK) as the DoD-selected representative Joint precision munition, and maturation of alternative PNT related technologies and solutions to enable informed A-PNT related PoR milestone and Army cross-functional modernization decisions.

Project FG1 C-DAEM: The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) Project will provide United States (U.S). ground forces with the capability to engage area personnel through armored targets, while denying threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was completed in January 2018 to inform Army acquisition and investment decisions regarding replacement of the current stockpile of 155 millimeter (mm) Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) with Department of Defense (DoD) policy compliant munitions and address anti-armor and extended range capability requirements.  The Army validated two materiel solutions for C-DAEM to be pursued in parallel.  C-DAEM Armor (Increment 1) will destroy moved and moving infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, and tanks. C-DAEM DPICM Replacement (Increment 2) will destroy personnel to light-skinned vehicles.  FY 2021 funding will support the completion of the C-DAEM Armor competitive demonstration phase, which will identify the most promising candidate(s) to support the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Project XT5 30mm Anti-Personnel and Counter UAS: Lightweight 30x113mm (LW30) Airburst is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Production Document (CPD), AH-64E Helicopter, Increment 1, Version 6. The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the Warfighter to effectively engage antipersonnel/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user with a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel and soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects. There is no funding requested in FY 2021.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Supercharge is a stand-alone top-zone 155 millimeter (mm) propelling charge required to achieve maximum range requirements from the XM1299A1 Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH). It will achieve lethality overmatch out to 70 kilometers (km) with developmental extended range projectiles, and will increase range with legacy projectiles by thirty percent. Supercharge is composed of combustible cartridge case (foamed celluloid or felted fiber technology), integral metal Stub Case, electrically initiated primer, and advanced artillery propellant.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will support design risk reduction and prototype maturation efforts for two parallel Supercharge variants (2-piece bag and cased) to support the concurrent development of ERCA Increment 1C and ERCA Increment 2 (with added automated loading system), which directly supports the Army's Long Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team priority in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Supercharge Project will consist of critical technology prototyping, testing, and demonstration of two variants: (1) the Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) of Supercharge 2-piece Bag to support the acceleration of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) Increment 1C to achieve lethality at 70km with precision accuracy by FY 2023, and (2) the Full Materiel Release (FMR) of Supercharge Cased to support ERCA Increment 2 with added automated loading system.  The Project will utilize the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) for the integration of components such as propellant, combustible case, igniter and stub case.  Upon design maturation, the Supercharge 2-piece Bag will transition and conduct Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) tasks to qualify the design for UMR to support the ERCA Increment 1C First Unit Issues (FUI).  The Supercharge Cased will require additional developmental testing and qualification for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to support ERCA Increment 2.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based production contract(s) will be awarded after the Supercharge Cased Milestone C for LRIP and Full Rate Production (FRP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OWL project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 caliber munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability, and increasing lethality by incorporating Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) technology into the new tracer ammunition. 7.62mm and 5.56mm are the immediate focus followed by a similar development strategy for .50 caliber cartridges. There is no Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding request.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EB9 Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM) supports the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the AAECM to include the XM215 Flare and XM20 Radio Frequency (RF) expendables. These expendable countermeasures systems are essential parts of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts are coordinated with Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation to address the AAECM capability, a critical enabler for the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) - Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Cross Functional Team (CFT) within the Army's top modernization priorities.

These advanced decoys will address deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. This program will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will demonstrate component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major Army aircraft platforms. FY 2021 supports initial developmental/operational testing on XM215 and RF Countermeasures (CM).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) Initial Capability Document (ICD) which outlines the requirements for new ammunition to support the rapid prototyping/development of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) under the Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) authority for rapid prototyping/rapid fielding. New ADVAP ammunition is designed to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.

The Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition is split into two initial variants, the General Purpose (GP) and the Special Purpose (SP).  The nomenclature for the GP ammunition is XM1186 and the nomenclature for the SP ammunition is XM1184. The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) ammunition to defeat hard targets.  

There is no Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding request.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers.  These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield.  Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization.  The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield.  This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will be used to reduce device cost and establish an alternate source for monitoring devices as well as verifying that issues found during testing have been resolved.  FY 2021 funding will also be used to demonstrate a suite of monitoring technologies, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability.  All research and development initiatives will be supporting the cross functional teams and the multi domain operations modernization objectives through deployment of prototypes for user evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. There is no funding requested in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Under PE 0604802A, Project EP3, Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) funding continues the development work of 7.62mm and supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and development work on the .50 Caliber variant which transitions in FY 2020.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>After 7.62mm Milestone (MS) B in FY 2019, the Government intends to award Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts. The Government will then award competitive contracts for 7.62mm Pre-Production Qualification Testing (PPQT) hardware in FY 2020 and down-select to a single contractor to complete EMD. The .50 Caliber program follows a similar strategy. The Government intends to award multiple competitive contracts for the .50 Caliber EMD.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions (APWM) - FA5 Project is focused on advanced risk mitigation, technology integration, prototyping, and product support to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems within a complex system of systems environment. The APWM Project reinforces the National Defense Strategy's major lines of effort through technology development and prototyping, which increases lethality and ensures future combat overmatch success of the Joint Force against peer/near-peer adversaries. This project also aims to improve program performance and affordability for multiple weapons and munitions Programs of Record (PoRs) via Joint Lethality Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) and Army M-Code Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinated efforts. The APWM Project directly supports top Army Modernization Priorities via the Assured-PNT (A-PNT) and Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross Functional Team (CFT) imperatives in support of the National Defense Strategy.  Funding will support engagement by Weapons and Munitions PNT experts in the development, evaluation, and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's M-Code GPS, Army's PNT related programs, and A-PNT CFT programs in support of LRPF and Counter Area Access/Area Denial missions. Funding will also enable component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a NavWar system-of-systems environment, Army M-Code GPS technology integration and evaluation, planning for next generation M-Code GPS integration into the Long Range Precision Guidance Kit (LR-PGK) as the Department of Defense-selected representative Joint precision munition, and maturation of alternative PNT related technologies and solutions to enable informed A-PNT related PoR milestone and Army cross-functional modernization decisions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Held multiple successful Joint Lethality Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) that led to increased collaboration among the joint lethality programs including weapons and munitions. This led to modeling and simulation, and test collaboration (sharing digital models and lab assets) which helped the lethality community become more efficient and reduce the potential for duplicative work.  The Joint Program Executive Office for Armaments and Ammunition (JPEO AA) was also able to successfully solicit continued review and feedback on the JPEO AA authored MGUE Inc2 PGM Technical Requirements document which was released by the Air Force for an approximate $750 Million dollar investment. Enabled A-PNT subject matter experts to participate and provide insightful feedback for multiple lethality program design reviews. Lastly, collaboration within this technical and overarching IPT led to collaborative technical maturation initiatives for enabling Assured PNT technology for precision weapons and munitions further increasing efficiency.  Developed revised expanded program investment plan for FY20+ based on guidance from OSD and Army Leadership.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) Project will provide United States (U.S). ground forces with the capability to engage area personnel through armored targets, while denying threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was completed in January 2018 to inform Army acquisition and investment decisions regarding replacement of the current stockpile of 155 millimeter (mm) Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) with Department of Defense (DoD) policy compliant munitions and address anti-armor and extended range capability requirements.  The Army validated two materiel solutions for C-DAEM to be pursued in parallel.  C-DAEM Armor (Increment 1) will destroy moved and moving infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, and tanks. C-DAEM DPICM Replacement (Increment 2) will destroy personnel to light-skinned vehicles.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will support the completion of the C-DAEM Armor competitive demonstration phase, which will identify the most promising candidate(s) to support the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>In FY 2021, Project FG1 supports C-DAEM Armor efforts.  C-DAEM Armor will transition to Budget Activity 05 PE 0604802A Weapons and Munitions - Eng Dev Project FJ4, Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM), in FY 2022.  In FY 2023, C-DAEM Armor will transition to production.  A Procurement of Ammunition, Army (PAA) funding line, Standard Study Number (SSN) E68603, PROJ, ARTY, 155MM C-DAEM INCREMENT 1, is established for this effort.

In FY 2021, the C-DAEM DPICM Replacement effort will transition to BA 05 PE 0604802A Weapons and Munitions - Eng Dev Project FJ4, Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM).  A PAA funding line for C-DAEM DPICM Replacement, SSN E68604, PROJ, ARTY, 155MM C-DAEM INCREMENT 2, will be established in FY 2024 for this effort.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>C-DAEM will employ an evolutionary acquisition approach to efficiently transition the unique ammunition products as they become available.  The AoA completed on 31 January 2018 qualified a dramatic enhancement of operational Fires effectiveness, efficiency, and maneuver support when cannon artillery was equipped with a dedicated extended range, anti-armor projectile.  The U.S. Government is currently reducing risk by executing prototype testing and evaluation efforts in parallel to decompose the AoA results into selection criteria.  C-DAEM will use the selection criteria to sponsor a competitive demonstration for C-DAEM Armor to streamline the acquisition process by leveraging Section 815 of the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  C-DAEM will use the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to further support the completion of the C-DAEM Armor competitive demonstration phase, in FY 2021, which will inform the Army's cluster munition replacement strategy.  Upon completion of the competitive demonstration phase, C-DAEM will proceed to qualification testing of the most promising candidate(s) in accordance with the decisions granted at the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC), in April 2018.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Lightweight 30x113 millimeter (mm) (LW30) Airburst is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Production Document (CPD), AH-64E Helicopter, Increment 1, Version 6.  The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the warfighter to effectively engage anti-personnel/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user with a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel and soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects.  There is no funding requested in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Vendors will continue to develop the critical technologies to be designed and tested at the sub-system level for integration into the M789 round. The main effort in FY 2019 will focus on ammunition and system integration which will culminate with the demonstration of a proximity airburst round fired from a ground mounted weapon.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Armored System Modernization provides focused investment for the technology development of combat vehicles for future battlefields. The purpose of this Program Element's (PE) funding is to integrate the next generation of technology enabled capabilities developed in the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio and Industry to demonstrate new capabilities to meet emerging military needs, provide hardware for Soldier operational experiment/feedback, and determine integration potential across the current Army portfolio of ground vehicles. The primary efforts include but not limited to, maturing and experimenting with Manned Un-Manned Teaming, in conjunction with the Robotic Combat Vehicle, maturing, integrating and experimenting with a variety of technologies for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), and other legacy combat vehicles/platforms within the Maneuver portfolio.  

Armored System Modernization allows for aggressive innovation that could provide a bridge from S&amp;T investment to vehicle integration and operational use. It can inform requirements through User Evaluations, mitigate capability gaps and reduce integration risks. The strategy will be to focus on delivering incremental experimental prototypes to the warfighter to demonstrate Manned Un-Manned Teaming (MUM-T), to integrate technologies to maintain overmatch while demonstrating crew task reductions through crew augmentation enabled by optimized Warfighter Machine Interface (WMI) and sensor fusion. The funding will support virtual and physical concept development, trade studies, technical and operational analyses to assess future concepts and designs. This effort will partner government organic capabilities and Industry for an iterative process to develop combat vehicle concepts and prototypes in order to inform and stabilize future capability requirements, performance characteristics, and affordability, evaluate and update operational concepts, and reduce future acquisition risk. This would also include the support for survivability and lethality requirements/qualifications. In addition, this funding will support program management, system integration labs, technology maturation, integration risk reduction, qualification of key lethality/weapon system and sensor technologies to support current and future increments of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), and other legacy combat vehicles/platforms within the Maneuver portfolio.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the advanced component development and prototyping of Joint Service combat ration components/platforms and field feeding equipment designed to improve warfighter performance and reduce the logistics burden of subsistence support. Efforts funded in this Project support all four Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency.  The Army serves as the Executive Agent for this Department of Defense (DoD) program, with oversight and coordination provided by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board as required by DoD Directive (DoDD) 3235.02E. Centralized execution of the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Program (CFREP) with Joint Service review and approval eliminates unnecessary duplication of efforts across the Services and maximizes use of common materiel solutions. Prototypes validated within this effort transition to 0604713A/Project 548 for System Development and Demonstration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The REF FY 2021 RDT&amp;E request is $2.786 million (Base) is for system integration, testing, and evaluation to support project requirements

The REF is the Army's Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) with the ability to acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), and Non-Standard Equipment (NSE) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for globally employed forces.  It inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select-prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.  The REF assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions to inform materiel development for the future Army capability requirements and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.

The REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Memorandum, Under Secretary of the Army, 30 Jan 2014, subject:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF).

The REF bridges the gap between the Army's traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding immediate and effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier Readiness, effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF 10-Liner process provides the ability to react quickly to an ever-changing enemy who changes in days and months, not years in a complex world.  The REF coordinates with the Combatant Command (COCOMs) and Army Service Component Command (ASCCs) in theater to fully understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  Although the REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, it focuses on Brigade level and below to equip solutions to identified capability gaps.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier as the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to institutionalize the acquisition authorities in support of the REF and to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the Soldier's needs serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).  This establishes a formal acquisition reporting chain that leverages existing reporting venues to ensure appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) visibility, oversight, and direction.  

The REF capabilities cross all Warfighter Functions:
1.	Mission Command
2.	Movement and Maneuver
3.	Intelligence 
4.	Fires
5.	Sustainment
6.	Protection 

The RDT&amp;E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, and innovative solutions.  RDT&amp;E funds are necessary in the majority of all REF projects.  Most importantly, REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct safety certification (testing) for non-standard equipment before it is equipped to the Soldier.  This critical requirement exists to ensure that REF-provided equipment is safe for Soldiers to use and that any risks are identified and documented.  The REF also requires RDT&amp;E funds to integrate several different COTS/GOTS and NDI technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems.    

The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to modify, test, and evaluate existing technologies that were developed for one purpose, however may be suitable to solve another problem. REF will also fund deliberate projects in support of technology-solution-scouting to meet anticipated Army needs and to mitigate operational gaps. These efforts measure and identify current technologies, and provide information to better inform Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and other communities of interest, with the intent of enlightening future Army requirements.  Example efforts that may require RDTE include the following projects:  Tactical Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and communications systems; tactical and small Combat Out Post/Forward Operating Base (COP/FOB) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Force Protection systems; Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS); Electronic Warfare (EW) systems; Non-Tactical Vehicles (NTV); Persistent Duration UAS, and Subterranean (SubT) Operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The REF partners with ASCC forces and Army SOF community to support globally deployed Soldiers and regionally aligned BCTs in all areas of responsibility.  The REF anticipates increased uncertainty regarding the future of OIR and other operations in the CENTCOM AOR requiring additional flexibility to develop technological solutions supporting the reduced numbers of Soldiers operating globally in order to fill force protection gaps in the face of a lethal terrorism threat.  The REF expects to continue our engagement with the ASCCs to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints.  Conversely, the REF will increase its understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations.   The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the GRF as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  In accordance with REF?s participation in the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) led quick reaction capability effort, the Army determined the REF would provide the Army?s warm base capability at ~600 requirements in FY19 and beyond.

For FY19 the REF projects ~495 (Base/OCO) requirements in the following REF Warfighter function areas.

1.  Mission Command
2.  Movement and Maneuver
3.  Intelligence
4.  Fires
5.  Sustainment
6.  Protection

The FY19 funds for projects in the amount of $1.160 million  (10% of Budget); breakout is base on the FY18 requirements trend.

The REF anticipates ATEC testing and evaluation cost of $4.546 million.  The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier - any modified COTS/GOTS/NDI item has to be tested.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>The REF will partner with ASCC forces and Army SOF community to support globally deployed Soldiers and regionally aligned BCTs in all areas of responsibility.  The REF anticipates increased uncertainty regarding the future of Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and other operations in the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR) requiring additional flexibility to develop technological solutions supporting the reduced numbers of Soldiers operating globally in order to fill force protection gaps in the face of a lethal terrorism threat.  The REF expects to continue our engagement with the ASCCs to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints.  Conversely, the REF will increase its understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations.  The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the GRF as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.

The FY 2021 funds for projects in the amount of $279K (10% of Budget); breakout is based on the current FY 2019 requirements trend.

The REF anticipates ATEC testing and evaluation cost of $2.507 million.  The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier ? any modified COTS/GOTS/NDI item has to be tested.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of U.S. Army Forces employed globally.   The REF focus is on rapidly placing capabilities into Soldiers' hands.  This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) rapidly adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs, and 2) utilizing emerging deployable capabilities via interaction with research and development organizations and academia.  All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment are provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved acquisition program or terminated through an approved Army process.  Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation and future capability development.  REF capabilities routinely serve as a bridge to specific ONS, JUONS, and JEONS gaps to meet urgent operational requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures.  TENCAP: (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the Analysis and Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination and Feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to the Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near real-time support to contingency operations.

Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) Space prototype system will provide timely assured intelligence for long range precision fires and maneuver in connected and A2AD environments; Assured access to Space ISR: National, Army and Commercial; Software Analytics capability to enable the intelligence cycle with increased speed, precision and accuracy Automated/Assisted Sensor-to-Shooter workflows: speed, scalability, accuracy to support LRPF in an A2AD environment; Modern and consolidated ground station for space and select aerial sensors. TITAN is pending the creation of its own project line 643766.BX9 in FY 2022, once the strategy and validation of the requirement can be finalized within HQDA.

The Multi Domain Sensor System (MDSS) will provide multiple sensing capabilities by developing and prototyping survivable sensor capabilities on higher altitude platforms that can perform effective stand-off operations. MDSS will exploit and disrupt enemy Radio Frequency (RF) capabilities and systems.  They include Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Moving Target Indicator (MTI), Cyber/EW, Air-Launched Effects (ALE) and Aircraft Survivability sensors.  These will allow stand-off operations to detect, locate, identify and track critical targets for the ground commander.  Developing and demonstrating this sensing capabilities on higher altitude platforms is the first step toward gaining advantage against threats posed by adversarial anti-access and area-denial efforts in the competition phase of operations.

The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) strategy will provide prototyping, development and experimentation of the Tactical Space Layer (TSL) sensors (electro optical, synthetic aperture radar, and radio frequency) which are designed to provide wide-area, responsive deep area sensing required for beyond line of sight (BLOS) targeting and force maneuver, significantly reducing Sensor to Shooter (S2S) timelines. Follow-on persistent prototype tactical sensor capabilities will be integrated with the Army Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) ground station which will provide direct tasking and assured access directly supporting live-fire S2S demonstrations and assessments. The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) realignment from Program Element (PE) 1206308A Project FE5 to PE 0603766A Project 907 occurs in FY 2022.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) office serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures. TENCAP: (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits and influences new developments that focus on improving the Analysis and Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination and Feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to the Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near real-time support to contingency operations.  

FY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $55.975 million provides: (1) Per direction of the Army ISR Task Force and Future Command, initial risk reduction, analytics and engineering development of the prototype for Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) space system; (2) Advanced Miniaturized Data Acquisition System (AMDAS) 'Next' system development; AMDAS Dissemination Vehicle (ADV) improvements; Remote Ground Terminal (RGT) development in order to support TITAN Space risk reduction, analytics and prototyping efforts; (3) engineering and collaborative development on multiple validated National Intelligence Community (IC) advanced software and prototype developments that leverage National IC investments for Army use and ensure continuous Army interoperability with National IC assets and architectures; (4) advanced development of capabilities for Air Vigilance (AV) Army Program of Record; and (5) development of TENCAP Radio Frequency Exploitation (TRFE) effort to support future synchronization of SIGINT, Cyber and Electronic Warfare operations.

Multi-Domain Sensing System (MDSS) - FY 2021 base dollars in the amount of $52 million supports MDSS development and prototyping. The Multi Domain Sensor System (MDSS) will provide multiple sensing capabilities by developing and prototyping survivable sensor capabilities on higher altitude platforms that can perform effective stand-off operations. MDSS will exploit and disrupt enemy Radio Frequency (RF) capabilities and systems.  They include Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Moving Target Indicator (MTI), Cyber/EW, Air-Launched Effects (ALE) and Aircraft Survivability sensors.  These will allow stand-off operations to detect, locate, identify and track critical targets for the ground commander.  Developing and demonstrating this sensing capabilities on higher altitude platforms is the first step toward gaining advantage against threats posed by adversarial anti-access and area-denial efforts in the competition phase of operations.

The Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) FY 2021 base dollars in the amount of $86.80 million dollars supports the prototyping, development, and experimentation of Tactical Space Layer (TSL) sensors (electro optical, synthetic aperture radar, and radio frequency)  designed to provide wide-area, responsive deep area sensing required for beyond line of sight (BLOS) targeting and force maneuver, significantly reducing Sensor to Shooter (S2S) timelines. Follow-on persistent prototype tactical sensor capabilities will be integrated with the Army Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) ground station which will provide direct tasking and assured access directly supporting live-fire S2S demonstrations and assessments. This is not a new start project.  LEO ISR project transitions from Program Element (PE) 1206308A Project FE5 to PE 0603766A Project 907</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) mission is a Congressionally-mandated and chartered enduring requirement to leverage National Intelligence capabilities useful to the tactical Army.  The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2, Army G8, Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)], and includes representatives from the Army G3, Army G6, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on the TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy to Army investments.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army PORs.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&amp;S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National Intelligence agencies, labs, industry partners and academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these national capabilities into enduring Army programs.

Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) Space prototype system will provide timely assured intelligence for long range precision fires and maneuver in connected and A2AD environments; Assured access to Space ISR: National, Army and Commercial; Software Analytics capability to enable the intelligence cycle with increased speed, precision and accuracy Automated/Assisted Sensor-to-Shooter workflows: speed, scalability, accuracy to support LRPF in an A2AD environment; Modern and consolidated ground station for space and select aerial sensors TITAN is pending the creation of its own project line 643766BX9 in FY 2022 once the strategy and validation of the requirement can be finalized within HQDA.

Multi-Domain Sensing System (MDSS) - FY 2021 base dollars in the amount of $52 million supports MDSS development. The Multi Domain Sensor System (MDSS) will provide multiple sensing capabilities by developing and prototyping survivable sensor capabilities on higher altitude platforms that can perform effective stand-off operations. MDSS will exploit and disrupt enemy Radio Frequency (RF) capabilities and systems.  They include Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Moving Target Indicator (MTI), Cyber/EW, Air-Launched Effects (ALE) and Aircraft Survivability sensors.  These will allow stand-off operations to detect, locate, identify and track critical targets for the ground commander.  Developing and demonstrating this sensing capabilities on higher altitude platforms is the first step toward gaining advantage against threats posed by adversarial anti-access and area-denial efforts in the competition phase of operations.

The Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) FY 2021 base dollars in the amount of $86.80 million dollars supports the prototyping, development, and experimentation of Tactical Space Layer (TSL) sensors (electro optical, synthetic aperture radar, and radio frequency) designed to provide wide-area, responsive deep area sensing required for beyond line of sight (BLOS) targeting and force maneuver, significantly reducing Sensor to Shooter (S2S) timelines. On-going Army S&amp;T, Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations, National and industry prototype efforts will continue experimentation in FY21. Follow-on persistent prototype tactical sensor capabilities will be integrated with the Army Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) ground station which will provide direct tasking and assured access directly supporting live-fire S2S demonstrations and assessments.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element focuses on efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems that facilitate the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices transitioning from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield.

Project BQ5 (Visual Augmentation System-Advanced Development) focuses on developing the next generation vision system that provides the Soldier with the ability to "fight, win and survive, day and night, in a multi-domain environment now and tomorrow".   Funded efforts will accelerate the development of components, algorithms and demonstrations in support of the next generation day/night vision system.  Provide Rapid Target Acquisition capability with the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual and next generation End User Device (EUD), to include advanced EUD applications.  The focus is to integrate external data sources and advanced processed imagery with overlay data display.  This project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for development of Soldier sensor devices, transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) stage to operational use. This project includes associated costs for efforts associated with integration and interface of products on the Soldiers' head, body, and weapon. This is a priority of the Secretary's Close Combat Lethality Task Force.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Project VT7 (Soldier Maneuver Sensors-Advanced Development) focuses on developing integrated and enhanced solutions that provide the Soldier with the ability to "fight, win and survive, day and night, in a multi- domain environment now and tomorrow". Products include maneuver capabilities to detect, recognize and identify targets, and to provide target acquisition capabilities to mitigate threats prior to being engaged. The integration of higher performing multi-spectral sensors with smart processing will provide adjusted weapon sight reticles and leverage network connectivity for improved situational awareness/understanding. Additional capabilities include signature management and resiliency across the electromagnetic spectrum, integration of a modular design structure for target acquisition applications including support for wireless data transfer passive range determination, and mitigation of manned and unmanned threat sensor systems. This project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for development of Soldier sensor devices transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) stage to operational use. This project includes costs for efforts associated with development, certification, verification and validation of interface products into the Adaptive Squad Architecture (ASA). This project also includes development of tools and emulators of ASA components. Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Project VT8 (Soldier Precision Targeting Devices - Advanced Development) focuses on developing component technologies and representative prototype systems for Soldier portable precision targeting devices to continue improvements to system performance while reducing size, weight, and power required by those systems. Efforts will improve the Soldier's ability to precisely locate and designate targets across a broader range of operating environments, including all weather conditions and GPS-contested environments. Component technology development will precede integration into specific systems and will include improved Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices; solid-state, improved lasers for range finding/designation/marking; electro-optical sensors such as infrared, near-infrared, ultra-violet, and visible spectrum imagers; sensor and data fusion; laser designator spot detection and imaging; integration of advanced power management technologies.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project focuses on developing integrated and enhanced solutions that provide the Soldier with the ability to "fight, win and survive, day and night, in a multi- domain environment now and tomorrow". Products include maneuver capabilities to detect, recognize and identify targets, and to provide target acquisition capabilities to mitigate threats prior to being engaged. The integration of higher performing multi-spectral sensors with smart processing will provide adjusted weapon sight reticles and leverage network connectivity for improved situational awareness/understanding. Additional capabilities include signature management and resiliency across the electromagnetic spectrum, integration of a modular design structure for target acquisition applications including support for wireless data transfer passive range determination, and mitigation of manned and unmanned threat sensor systems. This project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for development of Soldier sensor devices transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) stage to operational use. This project includes costs for efforts associated with development, certification, verification and validation of interface products into the Adaptive Squad Architecture (ASA). This project also includes development of tools and emulators of ASA components. Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Soldier Enhanced Sensing Capabilities provides the next generation vision capabilities for day and night that will reduce the Soldier's burden and allow hands free operation.  Soldier Enhanced Sensing Capabilities will provide automatic adjustment of imagery and matched sensor fields of view. This effort will provide day/night Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) capability by interfacing with Family of Weapon Sights-Individual (FWS-I), day/night data display for the Soldier Network Warrior End User Device/Computer (EUD), and ability to send/receive data to the EUD to support advanced EUD applications to process the sensor video, integrate it with external data sources, and produced advanced processed imagery with overlay data display. This effort will consider Integrated Vision Augmentation System (IVAS) successes and explore an integrated digital, low profile, conformal day/night display. Prototyping will provide multiple knowledge point events to gauge vendor progress and capability to the force.  This effort also includes continued digital Near-infrared (NIR) sensor development for potentially replace the aging fleet of Night Vision Devices.</r2:Description>

Work is continuing on a more robust, harder to detect and intercept wireless solution.  Integration of this 256-bit encryption solution will be performed on all Soldier Maneuver and Precision Targeting programs of record in an effort to establish a Intra Soldier Wireless (ISW) network.  In FY 2020, the ISW network will be documented (via ICDs) and available for use on any program that desires wireless connectivity with the ISW network.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project focuses on developing component technologies and representative prototype systems for Soldier portable precision targeting devices to continue improvements to system performance while reducing size, weight, and power required by those systems. Efforts will improve the Soldier's ability to precisely locate and designate targets across a broader range of operating environments, including all weather conditions and GPS-contested environments. Component technology development will precede integration into specific systems and will include improved Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices; solid-state, improved lasers for range finding/designation/marking; electro-optical sensors such as infrared, near-infrared, ultra-violet, and visible spectrum imagers; sensor and data fusion; laser designator spot detection and imaging; integration of advanced power management technologies.  Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There is broad potential application for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations. However, technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it. This Program Element (PE) includes Projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques. It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities. The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential. EQT demonstration/validation is systemic and applicable across Department of Army sites and installation problems (e.g. unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination). This PE supports the Army's top modernization priorities by addressing potential obsolescence of legacy materials and current and emerging impacts on human health and the environment. All work is endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment to determine when the technology can transition to the user for implementation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE) was established by Congress in 1990 with a directive to "serve as a national leadership organization to address high priority environmental problems for the Department of Defense (DoD), other government organizations, and the industrial community." The NDCEE Program is a national resource for developing and disseminating advanced environmental technologies. The NDCEE is used to: demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process. The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation. This Project is managed by the Army on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment.  In May 2008, the Project name was re-designated from the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters. This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management."

The United States (U.S.) Army's broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others. Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at Army installations. The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives in consideration of mission, readiness, innovation, lethality and modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NDCEE is a national asset focused on DoD applications that include technology transfer to appropriate DoD transition partners. The management strategy for the NDCEE ensures that all projects have a potential multi-service benefit and have a high potential for transition success. At the strategic level, the NDCEE Executive Advisory Board (EAB) is chaired by the DoD NDCEE Lead Agent on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment and is representative of the services and DoD. The EAB and the Program Director are supported by the NDCEE Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to help ensure that NDCEE investments are maximized across DoD and the Services. At the tactical level, the three Focus Groups (environment, safety/occupational health, and energy) cultivate and recommend priority projects to the TAG and Project Selection Committee for funding. Transition Partners ensure that NDCEE's investments are carried forward in the next phases of the Research Development Test and Evaluation process, as identified in each funded project's Technology Transition Agreement.

NDCEE projects enable readiness for the Services under increasingly complex and demanding scenarios. The interdependency of national security with energy supply and costs, water supply and costs, environmental resiliency, and human health and safety are clear and NDCEE projects provide forward-looking solutions to these challenges. Failure to further fund and validate promising technologies that are at the mature or Commercial-off-the-Shelf stage, would result in lost modernization opportunities and validation before they go into a military environment. These initiatives need to be carried forward into an operational/realistic testing environment so that they can support mission readiness and training when ultimately fielded to the Services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototypes of innovative environmental quality technologies that modernize materials and processes required for current and future operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities. The Project showcases technologies that increase life safety, reduce Soldier and worker human health risks, enhance readiness and enable mission capabilities of the current and future force with a focus on eliminating the high priority issues associated with hexavalent chromium, cadmium and airborne lead through material substitution. The Project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating modern materials and processes to fulfill or surpass the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data. Forward-looking materials and processes demonstrated under this project support the Cross Functional Teams and the Army's top modernization priorities by addressing potential obsolescence of legacy materials and current and emerging impacts on human health and the environment. Modernized materials and processes have the additional benefit of reducing future regulatory compliance and cleanup requirements while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army, resulting in significantly reduced life cycle costs incurred by acquisition, industrial base and installation end users.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the U.S. and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries through technology sharing and joint equipment development, thereby reducing U.S. acquisition costs. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The Project focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Activities are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.

The goal of this activity is to expand worldwide allied standardization and interoperability through cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the U.S. Army. The execution AR 70-41 responsibilities requires DASA (DE&amp;C) to conduct engagement with key strategy foreign partners in all regions of the world through the SNR(A) program, international agreement negotiations, and other bilateral and multilateral forums involving DASA (DE&amp;C) personnel. This program will fund the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate internationally, such as the NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&amp;D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: 
The goal of this program is to expand worldwide allied standardization interoperability through cooperative research and development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing  per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the of the U.S. Army. 
All projects are test or technical demonstrations to feed into potential new requirements in support of Army Transformation to the Future Force or as product improvements to the Current Force.

List of the programs curently in place:
Communications, Interoperability, and Electronics Technologies
The goal of this project is to develop technologies that enable interoperability among partner countries' command, control, communications, sensors, and information systems.   Efforts under this project include development of a single solution standard avoiding development of multiple unique solutions and leverage existing interoperability standards developed by NATO. Such standards include common doctrine, technical and procedural specifications to make better use of existing information, shared data, leverage national operating picture capabilities and enable the development of interoperability of data, databases, applications, security domains and national networks architectures.  Includes projects formerly titled Multi-National Network Enabled Capabilities, Low Level Air Defense Interoperability, JTRS, Combat Identification, and Multilateral Interoperability Program.

Aviation Systems Technologies 
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly improved aerodynamics, aeromechanics, avionics, weapons and sensor integration, propulsion, and aviation autonomy technologies that improve range, payloads, speed, survivability and lethality to maintain U.S. technical superiority and combat overmatch for vertical lift aviation systems.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Ground Systems Technologies
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly technologies to improve survivability, weapons, ground platforms (manned and unmanned), and mobility and counter-mobility to provide soldiers with unmatched offensive and defensive capabilities in weapons and military vehicles.   Areas of cooperation include ground systems design, propulsion, structures, robotics, alternative fuels and lubricants, systems integration, electronics, and power management.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Weapons and Munitions Technologies
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly technologies to improve range, payloads, speed, survivability and lethality to maintain U.S. technical superiority and combat overmatch for Army weapons systems and associated munitions.   Areas of cooperation include fuzing and warhead systems, guidance systems, counter improvised explosive device neutralization, directed energy, and fire control systems.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Armaments Cooperation Enterprise Support
The goal of this program is to expand worldwide allied standardization and interoperability through cooperative research and development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the U.S. Army. This program will fund the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate internationally, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&amp;D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding. This program will also include:  the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (U. S. Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill); the Technical Cooperation Program, and Army armaments cooperation working groups with many nations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. The Department of Defense (DOD) established FVL to focus vertical lift capabilities and technology development as well as retain long-term industrial base capabilities. The Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan in 2012 to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, the Army identified FVL as one of the Army's six modernization priorities, and established the FVL Cross Functional Team. The FVL objectives are increased vertical lift maneuverability, range, speed, payload, survivability, and reliability while reducing the logistical footprint.  This capability will provide critical aviation support to the joint warfighter and maneuver force. FVL will integrate advanced technologies and design configurations with appropriate trades to ensure affordability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY 2019, Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) Capability Set Three increased by $7.628 million (Below Threshold Reprogramming) for additional staffing in acquisition, engineering, logistics, and business functionals to support development of Program of Record strategy, acquisition documentation, Contracts Requirements Package (CRP), and Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction efforts.   The Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Capability Set One competitive prototyping effort was initiated in FY 2019 with a Congressional Add on Project B47 Future Vertical Lift.   In FY 2020, FARA funds are requested under Project F12 Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.

FLRAA FY 2020 budget increased by $75.6 million for Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction efforts and $5 million for university partnership efforts. FARA FY 2020 budget decreased by $34.0 million to align with current Competitive Prototyping efforts. FLRAA budget increase of $5 million for university partnership efforts is aligned incorrectly to Project F12 Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.  This funding will be correctly re-aligned to Project B47 Future Vertical Lift for execution.  

FLRAA FY 2021 budget increased by $112.369 million for continued execution of Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction efforts, development of the Contract Requirements Package, and initiation of the Source Selection Evaluation Board and the FARA FY 2021 budget decreased by $0.499 million.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Project's funding provides for the development of a Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) Capability Set Three weapon system within the FVL family of systems. FLRAA will conduct air assault, urban assault/security, maritime interdiction, medical evacuation, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, tactical resupply, direct action, non combatant evacuation operation, and combat search and rescue operations in support of the Army, including Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Joint Force, in a contested, near peer threat environment. The FLRAA weapon system will retain the Army's ability to project combat power with significantly increased range, speed, mobility, and payload over current Army and USSOCOM aircraft. FLRAA achieved a Materiel Development Decision approval in October 2016 and the Office of Secretary of Defense granted a sufficiency determination of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in July 2019. Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funded completion of the AoA, continued to support initiation of program documentation, and funded establishment of an FVL Architecture Risk Reduction effort in support of Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) for both FLRAA and the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft. FY 2020 funding will support continuation of the FVL Architecture Risk Reduction effort; support life cycle affordability efforts; initiate planning and proposal evaluations of the Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction efforts; and support the completion of key program documents to include the Program Strategy, Weapon System Specification, Systems Engineering Plan, Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) and Contract Requirements Package (CRP). FY 2021 funding supports the continued execution of the Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction and MOSA efforts, development of the CRP, and the initiation of Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In order to support the Army's modernization strategy and concept for multi-domain operations, the FLRAA program will deliver a first unit equipped in FY 2030.  This accelerated approach builds on the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR-TD) efforts (ongoing since 2013); the Army's AoA (completed in July 2019); and multiple ongoing risk mitigation efforts.

The Army's risk mitigation activities ahead of the Program of Record (PoR) include: (1) additional conceptual design and flight envelop expansion tasks on the four existing JMR-TD Technology Investment Agreements; (2) a modular open systems approach (MOSA), FVL Architecture Collaboration Working Group (with participation from industry and academia) to establish a common architecture requirements framework for FLRAA and FARA system development; and (3) a Competitive Demonstration and Risk Reduction (CD&amp;RR) effort using an Aviation Missile and Technology Consortium (AMTC) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements to provide substantiating technical documentation on weapon system designs, requirements decompositions, trade-studies, and requirements feasibility for the FLRAA PoR.

These risk reduction activities maintain industry engagement &amp; momentum from the JMR-TD S&amp;T program, inform capabilities and system requirements, and provide initial trade assessments for the final operational requirements. They also inform the final acquisition strategy; mature the Government's architecture requirements development; and transition appropriate S&amp;T data and technologies to the PoR.  The Army plans to initiate the PoR in FY 2022 with a hybrid acquisition approach. This approach includes the opportunity to employ new DODI 5000.80 authorities along with a tailored DODI 5000.02 acquisition strategy. 

Finally, the Army is also addressing life cycle affordability, sustainability, and maintainability early in the program. The FLRAA program is employing multiple strategies including:  should cost reduction opportunities; use of a digital thread from design through sustainment; and stochastic sustainment modeling. Additionally, FLRAA is one of the Army's pilot programs for life cycle intellectual property and data strategy development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Project's funding provides for the development of a Capability Set 1 aircraft system within the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) family of systems. FVL Capability Set 1 aircraft will conduct attack/reconnaissance missions in support of the Army's modernization objective of conducting Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). The FARA platform will fill the gap in capability for light weight attack/reconnaissance while significantly increasing speed, range, survivability, and lethality, providing Combatant Commanders with greatly increased tactical, operational and strategic capabilities. 

The FVL Capability Set 1 Initial Capabilities Requirements Document was approved in July 2018 under the name Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA). The Acquisition Approach and Determination &amp; Findings for Other Transaction Authority for Prototyping agreements were approved on 1 February 2019 by the Acting Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) to execute a Competitive Prototyping effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The FARA Competitive Prototype effort was initiated in FY 2019 with Congressional Add of $75.400 million under Program Element (PE) 0603801A Aviation - Adv Dev Project B47 Future Vertical Lift, which was shared with Future Long Range Assault Aircraft. FARA requirements will be executed under PE 0603801A Aviation - Adv Dev Project F12 Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft from FY 2020 and beyond.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program is executing a streamlined acquisition approach leveraging modern tools, processes, industry innovation, and leveraging efficiencies through the recently implemented Army Cross Functional Teams (CFT) strategy. The aircraft developed under this program will utilize a modular open system approach, which will enable more efficient and cost effective mission equipment integration throughout the lifecycle of the weapon system. 

The Army is executing a FARA Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort from FY 2019-2023 using Other Transaction Authority for Prototyping (OTAP) awards to five industry performers and will be executed utilizing a two-phased approach. The scope of this effort includes prototype design and fabrication process refinement, subsystem and representative system level testing, flight control and mission processor software development and testing, development of systems integration labs, development or modification of test fixtures and facilities, preparation of test plans and reports, the generation of airworthiness documentation, and qualification testing of all processes and subsystems within the prototype aircraft. 

Phase one is the initial design phase which was awarded in April 2019 and phase two will begin in March 2020 when two of the five vendors are selected for final detailed design and the development, integration and test of a flyable prototype air vehicle. Phase two will culminate with a government flight test evaluation of the FARA Competitive Prototype no later than the end of FY 2023. 

The Competitive Prototype effort will inform full FARA Weapon System requirements development process, and will develop the data needed to reduce the risks for full weapon system design, integration, testing, and qualification to be completed during the FARA engineering, manufacturing and development phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:Remarks>Under the Other Transaction Authorities for Prototyping (OTAP), five incrementally funded agreements were awarded in April 2019 which have payments based on performance milestones through Fiscal Year (FY) 2023. There will be no additional contract awards or contract options executed. Funding will be incrementally added to the existing awards by modification as negotiated with each performer. In March 2020, two of the five performers will be selected for continued execution and the other three performers will be issued a stop work order and cease to receive additional funding.

NOTE: $5.000 million Congressional add for Future Long Range Assault Aircraft for university partnerships to be re-aligned and executed on Project B47 / Future Vertical Lift.</r2:Remarks>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>FY 2021 Program funding reduced $1,363K was due to underexecution in FY 2019.  This was a result of contract award delays, contractor delay, billings, etc.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 526 Marine Orientation Logistics and Engineering Advanced Development supports Dynamic Force Repositioning (DFR) and provides the Combatant and Multi-Domain Task Force Commander with organic waterborne lift capability that can deliver today's Army maneuver platforms and equipment, and supply bulk fuel and water across the full spectrum of operations with increased speed and lower draft; and mitigates anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat by providing access to shallow coastal waters, rivers, in narrow inland waterways in support of dispersed force elements in austere environments and where mature ports or road networks are unavailable.  The MSVs are critical modernization efforts in support of the Army's Watercraft Transformation Strategy (AWTS) and Army Force Package 2.0. 

In general, this project supports efforts and studies for advanced component development, including prototypes of equipment and sub-systems to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, and survivability while increasing the lethality, tactical mobility, and operational capability of the Army Mariner to preserve the Combatant Commanders requirement of "freedom of seas" access in all areas of the world particularly the littorals, to support maneuver operations in all Areas of Responsibility.

In addition, funded efforts will address critical gaps in these areas for the legacy fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies. To support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, funding efforts will include conducting trade studies, Business Case Analyses to inform the requirement development process, and support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The funding enables Army's compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and compliance with Environmental protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.

FY 2021 RDTE dollars in the amount of $0.841 million supports modernization of the legacy fleet by investigating technology insertions, including, but not limited to: force protection, condition based maintenance, vessel electronics, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.

In FY 2021, $0.178 million in Reimbursable Manpower for this line has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance.  Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort funds the development and testing of the Armored Mobile Earthmover (AME). AME will replace the M9 Armored Combat Earthmover and will be primarily a mobility asset, enabling maneuver units during attacks and movements to contact.  The AME will provide hasty survivability and counter-mobility capabilities to the maneuver units until more survivability and counter-mobility assets can move forward to support the maneuver force?s defenses.  It will operate with primarily medium and heavy mechanized forces but will be capable of supporting all combat forces and the full range of military operations.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort #4, Command Post (CP). The technologies in this portfolio are specifically designed to target CP challenges to enable power resilience across the operational spectrum and to resolve issues with setup and tear-down times and with the CP mobility and footprint. Additionally, this project supports enablers of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) which is a priority technology for the Network and Soldier Lethality CFT's.

As the DoD's Lead Standardization Activity for Tactical Electric Power (TEP), Project Manager Expeditionary Energy &amp; Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2) matures and integrates technology that will improve the next generation of standard tactical power sources in support of all Services. It supports technical maturation of TEP systems that will extend Army operational mission reach and duration in support of the Army Operating Concept and Multi-Domain Battle. 

Funding supports modernization of the current Tactical Electric Power capability with technology insertions including, but not limited to hybrid capabilities, light-weight power solutions, vehicle/tactical microgrid interoperability and Tactical Microgrid Standards (TMS).   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment an operational energy concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports development of critical cargo aerial delivery capabilities. These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness. This Project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical Distribution Capabilities which provide improved safety and accuracy while increasing survivability of aircraft, personnel, and equipment. This Project develops critical enablers that support the Army in executing future movement and maneuver operations and distributed sustainment support by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This Project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Effort to reduce rigging times while also providing the capability to rapidly de-rig loads on the drop zone. This will reduce the lead time to prepare Low Velocity Airdrop System (LVADS) loads while also increasing the survivability of receiving ground forces by ensuring the airdrop loads (to include weapon systems, prime movers, trailers, etc.) are quickly de-rigged and made operational. RRDAS is a three phase Research, Development, Testing and Engineering (RDT&amp;E) effort, Phase I will focus on loads up to 20,000 pounds and platform lengths up to 20 feet and will include prime movers such as HMMWV.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of critical soldier support and sustainment systems that provide more endurance and agility to combat operations enabling success of Army Expeditionary Forces in future multi-domain scenarios.  Project includes shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), expeditionary base camp subsystems, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, field heaters, and other combat service support equipment. These systems will fill identified theater capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, improve resource and energy efficiency and increase combat effectiveness. This Project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms. This Project develops critical enablers that support the Army Campaign Plan and Army Modernization Strategy by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Reduces the resource, operational energy and logistics footprint of critical soldier support and sustainment systems while maintaining or improving operational effectiveness.  The goal is to significantly reduce fuel, water, and power requirements to sustain multi-domain operations in addition to reducing maintenance and spare parts requirements. Systems such as Command Posts, Expeditionary Operating Bases, and Combat Support Hospitals require a significant amount of logistics and sustainment support which cost valuable resources, require extra human effort (that means a risk in the form of Soldiers on the road), limit endurance, restrict agility, and increase vulnerability.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The ASF-RWS program will conduct formal development to incorporate the latest technologies into a fully supportable and modernized family. The intent is to eliminate the proliferation of non-standard shelters and their associated logistics burden, thereby reducing the lifecycle cost of RWS across the Services. The program will produce approved Technical Data Packages (TDPs) to support procurements by materiel developers and Program Managers (PMs) requiring RWS. ASF-RWS procurements are customer funded by PMs as a cost under their program(s). The ASF-RWS will consist of three variants: (1) Expandable/Non-Expandable; (2) Vehicle Mounted; and (3) Panelized/Collapsible with a focus on the following features and improvements: reduced cost, reduced weight, improved energy efficiency, improved corrosion resistance, and improved transportability.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds development of medical materiel within the early system integration portion of the System Development and Demonstration phase of the acquisition life cycle using 6.4 (Advanced Component Development and Prototype) funding. Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness. Programs are aligned to meet future force requirements identified within concept documents and organizational structures. This PE also provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans. These efforts are managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. These efforts are in: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and studies to determine if insects infected with pathogenic organisms are capable of infecting service members/preventive medicine measures. These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug/vaccine works and continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices. This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and accelerated recovery time once diagnosed to enhance battlefield readiness. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members. Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production). Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 849.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of militarily relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. It provides for the planning and conduct of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess for safety and tolerability of medical countermeasures, how the drug/vaccine is distributed through, metabolized in, and excreted from the body, and to investigate the appropriate dose. Development efforts are focused on militarily unique needs affecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. The cumulative cost of treating HIV-positive DoD personnel is estimated to be $16.6 billion for 3000 personnel over a 50-year lifetime. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA regulations. Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 812.

Research efforts are coordinated with the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This Project funds human clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of biologics (products derived from living organisms) and devices necessary to meet medical requirements. When available, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for transition to engineering and manufacturing development. Consideration is also given to reducing the medical logistics footprint through smaller weight, volume, and equipment independence from supporting materials. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA regulations. Products from this project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 832.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project is funded to achieve the required operational capability and common capability across the MEDEVAC fleet. The MEDEVAC MEP program modernizes and retrofits MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by a limited number of mission specific MEDEVAC helicopters, to include Blackhawk and Future Vertical Lift. The Medevac Mission Equipment on the Army MEDEVAC helicopters is critical to maintaining high US troop survival rates during current and future conflicts by evacuating wounded troops quickly while providing good care enroute. To better meet operational needs, in 2009 the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (VCSA) approved the force design update increasing the number of air frames for MEDEVAC companies. In 2010, the Army Medical Department (US Army) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation. Ongoing research and design efforts are required to prepare and optimize the MEDEVAC fleet with mission equipment. All products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project VS8.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE), Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, manages the Soldier as a system to increase combat effectiveness, test and deliver tangible products that save Soldiers lives and improve combat capability.  The PE provides funding for evaluating, developing, and testing emerging technologies and critical Soldier support systems to reduce technology risk.

The Integrated Squad effort includes the completion of the Adaptive Squad Architecture (ASA) and Squad Performance Model (SPM) programs.  Both of these efforts are Program Executive Office-Soldier (PEO-S) led and will develop a full system architecture for the Soldier and the Squad.  This will be accomplished by developing Interface Control Documents (ICDs) in order to provide common established interfaces for internal and external stakeholders who will interface on or with the Soldier platform.  A critical part of this effort is development of the "Squad as an Integrated Platform" vision based on threat, operational environment and collaboration with internal and external stakeholders to inform investment decisions out to FY 2050.  The ASA will develop a metric-based approach that will include live, virtual and constructive evaluations and tools across the Department of Defense (DoD), academia and industry which will be used for senior leaders to make deliberate decisions based on the analysis of Soldier/ Squad performance

ET8
Personnel Airdrop System supports efforts to improve Low Altitude and High Altitude personnel parachutes and associated equipment to include canopy improvement based on integration of new technology with the goal of enhancing the insertion capability and safety of the airborne Soldier and increasing the performance, reliability, and durability of personnel airdrop equipment.

S53
This Project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide a modular, integrated uniform/clothing system from skin out and head-to-toe. It funds efforts to transition new technologies and domestically available fabrics with Flame Resistant (FR), moisture wicking, insect protection and camouflage technologies, including integration of fabrics appropriate for uniforms and equipment used in jungle/tropical and arctic environments. New technologies are indentified to monitor health and improve Soldier survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort in combat and training/administrative environments. Includes integration and interface on the Soldier system.

S54
The Small Arms Improvement Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) program provides funds to mature, demonstrate, test and evaluate emerging technology from Budget Activity (BA) 3 Program Element 0603607A Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP) Project 627 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Department of Energy National Laboratories, Research Development &amp; Engineering Centers (RDECs) and other domestic and foreign sources for small arms weapon systems and technology. Small arm weapon systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition and tracking, fire control, usability, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include the maturing of technology through testing and evaluation of sub-system or system prototypes which demonstrates light weight materials, wear resistant/protective/anti-reflective coatings, observation/situational awareness improvements, human-systems integration, robotic armament capability, non-lethal capability, and equipment enhancements.  Benefits include continuous improvements to small arms weapon systems, fire control equipment, optics, gun barrels, training devices, suppressors, component mounts, weapon mounts, and weapon/ammunition interface. Includes costs associated with efforts for integration and interface of products on Soldiers' head, body and weapons.

Verify and maintain the Adaptive Squad Architecture (ASA) and Squad Performance Model (SPM) with emphasis on development of ICDs, specifically to support the rapid integration of the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) priority programs with all other equipment the dismounted Soldier will use. Provide prototyping of capabilities for evaluation and integration. Execute evaluation of new measurements and methodologies from the S&amp;T community, execute system level evaluation environments, and support Soldier system modeling.  Funding for this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy and is a priority of the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team.  FY 2020 RDTE funding in the amount of $1.959M will finalize an initial ASA and SPM, consisting of 3 critical products: the Configuration Database (CD), the Architectural Assessment Tool (AAT) and the SPM.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding in this project supports the Army's Cross Functional Teams (CFT) initiatives.  This Project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across a broad spectrum of users to provide a modular, integrated uniform/clothing system from skin out and head-to-toe. It funds efforts to transition new technologies and domestically available fabrics with Flame Resistant (FR), moisture wicking, insect protection and camouflage technologies, including integration of fabrics appropriate for uniforms and equipment used in all environments such as jungle/tropical and arctic environments. New technologies are indentified to monitor health and improve Soldier survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort in combat and training/administrative environments. Includes integration and interface on the Soldier system.  This project will transition capabilities from our Science and Technology partners to increase performance and safety of Soldier clothing and equipment.  It will continue to support cross-service initiatives to increase commonality.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Prototyping effort will produce unmanned combat vehicle prototypes with the purpose of providing vehicles that Soldiers will use to develop new Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and new requirements for unmanned combat vehicles to support Army Modernization priorities. RCV efforts will be executed in three (3) phases focused on increasing the complexity of RCV soldier maneuvers and expanding prototype platform capability. These efforts provide the basis for the Army to make the decision to move forward with a Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitioning from Technology Demonstrations to a Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) development, initial prototype testing and iterative Soldier evaluations. This will stress the autonomy systems developed within the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) base, assist the Next Generation Combat Vehicles Cross Functional Team (NGCV CFT) with refining RCV requirements, and develop the CONOPS and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for Manned / Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) in combat relevant missions.

Soldier Robotics Systems for Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. Joint Capabilites Integration and Development System, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing/transitioning technology. Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives/Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation/transition from S&amp;T projects, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle and maneuver under their own power. 

The Battery Modernization &amp; Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier and reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just 3. Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.

Robotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) RD improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing/transitioning technology. Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives/Letter of Sufficiency determinations, market research, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation/transition from S&amp;T projects, MDD, and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. Research Development Technology Evaluation (RDTE) funds enable support to capability development of emerging systems currently including Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF),  Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV), Dismounted Engineer Mobility System (DEMS), and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP). Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision). RDTE Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems funding supports Leader Follower and ABV program transitions from Technology Demonstrations to Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) development and initial prototype testing. This will stress the autonomy systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations. Funding also supports the exploration and development of Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) Applique on additional systems (Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), and 915 truck fleets) beyond the Palletized Load System (PLS) and applique kits on existing Tactical Wheeled Vehicles.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Prototyping effort will produce unmanned combat vehicle prototypes with the purpose of providing vehicles that Soldiers will use to develop new Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and new requirements for unmanned combat vehicles to support Army Modernization priorities. RCV efforts will be executed in three (3) phases focused on increasing the complexity of RCV soldier maneuvers and expanding prototype platform capability. These efforts provide the basis for the Army to make the decision to move forward with a Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitioning from Technology Demonstrations to a Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) development, initial prototype testing and iterative Soldier evaluations. This will stress the autonomy systems developed within the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) base, assist the Next Generation Combat Vehicles Cross Functional Team (NGCV CFT) with refining RCV requirements, and develop the CONOPS and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for Manned / Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) in combat relevant missions.

In order to accelerate user involvement with RCV platform capabilities, an RCV Prototyping effort will be executed through a three (3) phase activity.  The RCV surrogate platform build (Phase 1) was initiated in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 under 0604017A Robotics Development, Project FD9 Robotics Systems and will conclude in this project with test and demonstration. This project will finalize Phase 1's rapid prototype build of surrogate RCV platforms using existing robotized vehicles and conduct Soldier evaluations at the platoon level (4 RCVs) through MUM-T evaluations. In order to conduct larger scale MUM-T maneuvers and to continue to advance the autonomous performance of the robotic platforms, two additional platoons of RCVs will be built leveraging existing contractor unmanned platforms for a total of a company set (12) RCVs. The company of RCVs (Phase 2) will be used for a second round of Soldier experimentation building off of the platoon exercises and providing additional refinement of CONOPs/TTPs.

The RCV Phase 3 prototyping will build off lessons learned in Phases 1 and 2 and develop and produce innovative, unmanned platforms that investigate different approaches to solving challenges and building on opportunities in Phases 1 and 2 to include looking at different weight class RCV platform and new modular mission payloads for RCV platforms. The intent is to award a minimum of two contracts to design and build up to a company set (12) RCV platforms for user evaluation and experimentation starting at the end of FY 2024. The  RCV platforms will incorporate mature technology capabilities transitioned from S&amp;T as they become available to include the latest autonomous mobility capability, improved user control interfaces and advanced sensing and aided target recognition. The Phase 3 RCV platform requirements will be informed by the initial platoon and company experimentation (Phase 1 and 2) and Soldier feedback.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Prototype Platforms effort will produce unmanned combat vehicle prototypes with the purpose of creating an experimental unit that Soldiers will use to create new CONOPS and new requirements for unmanned combat vehicles to support Army Modernization priorities. Several variants of prototypes will be created, starting first with surrogate platforms which adapt existing platforms into surrogate RCVs for early experimentation in several different weight classes.  Based off of lessons learned from the surrogate vehicle builds, platforms optimized to be RCVs will be built which maximize the capability advantages that unmanned platforms can offer such as reduced platform size and weight. The platforms will be built with the purpose of going through Army Test &amp; Evaluation Center (ATEC) safety release and ultimately for Soldier evaluation through iterative User experimentation.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier Robotics Systems for Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, Robotic &amp; Autonomous Strategy (RAS), etc.) and by maturing/transitioning technology. Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives/Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation/transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) demonstration projects, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle and maneuver under their own power. 
Funding supports modernization of the current Ground Robotic fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Robotic Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts."

FY 2021 funding in the amount of $1.738 million supporting Unmanned Ground Vehicles program management activities including inter-service support, travel, conducting Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), draft performance specifications, prototype demonstrations, acquisition documents and request for proposal documentation on Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP) programs, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), Common Robotic System (Light Reconnaissance) Robot (LRR) (CRS(LR)), and payload technology maturation efforts.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Battery Modernization &amp; Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier and to reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just 3. Expand to include batteries for generators and hybrids, robotics, vehicles, and low density/usage systems.  Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.

Funding supports modernization of the current battery types.  Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Robotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing / transitioning technology. RDTE funds enable support to capability development of emerging systems currently including Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF),  Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV), Dismounted Engineer Mobility System (DEMS), and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP).  Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives / Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation / transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits.

Funding will expand Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) including Continuous Autonomy Simulation Test Laboratory Environment (CASTLE) capability to test and evaluate Manned Unmanned teaming, combat scenarios or other emerging Robotics program needs.  RD funding will utilize the M&amp;S environment to mature and evaluate S&amp;T for inclusion to program requirements, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and/or technical insertions, utilize gaming technology in conjunction with Autonomy Software to develop Training, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs), requirements and CONOPS. In addition, RD funds exploration and development of the Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) Applique on additional systems (Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) and 915 truck fleets) beyond the Palletized Load System (PLS).

Funding also supports modernization of the current Ground Robotic fleets and current Army vehicles by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Robotic Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies. Funding will also support developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Experimental Unit Prototyping effort will produce unmanned combat vehicle prototypes with the purpose of creating an experimental unit that Soldiers will use to create new Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), and new requirements for unmanned combat vehicles to support Army Modernization priorities. Effort will leverage a three phase approach to promote multiple industry partners to provide innovative, armed unmanned platforms for soldier experimentation with the intent of defining requirements for future RCV program of record.  The first two phases will focus on surrogate RCV platforms to get armed unmanned systems into Soldier?s hands for experimentation as quickly as possible. Phase 1 delivers a platoon set of modified M113s with remote weapons stations in order to start to define how an RCV can augment combat capability and to help refine requirements based on user feedback for a follow-on purpose built RCV effort which will start in Phase 3.  Phase 2 adds an additional two platoons of surrogate RCVs to enable soldiers to execute company level maneuvers to better understand how RCVs will be used in the future fight and to refine software behaviors and control strategies of the RCVs.. Lessons learned from the phase 1 soldier experimentation will directly shape the requirements for the Phase 3 purpose built RCV effort which will competitively deliver up to a company set of RCVs through at least 2 industry partners for an extended Soldier evaluation.  CONOPs and TTPS developed under Phase 2 will inform extended operations experiment in phase 3 and ultimately form the basis for a decision point to move forward with a procurement of RCVs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Robotics Development (RD) is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&amp;T) projects into emerging programs of record.  It informs the acquisition process early in the development cycle allowing key stakeholders the ability to make integration decisions and affordability trades while writing requirements.

Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (PdM ALUGS) builds upon the CCDC GVSC Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) Operational Technology Demonstration (OTD) to provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to Tactical Wheeled Vehicles including the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1, Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV). Efforts include Capabilities Document input, close analysis of OTD activities that feed cost estimates, capture technical and test data, provide test support, develop Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities, and develop a Software Integration Lab (SIL). Efforts may support Rapid prototyping to inform emerging programs and other Army systems. A "buy/lease, try and inform" methodology may be used to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.
  
Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) funding supports Systems Engineering, Requirements, Cost Analysis, Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) support, and technology transition plans.  

Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC) funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology.  The Army will build, and test prototype systems for safety release, Soldier use, and further technology maturation.  

Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Experimental Unit Prototyping will provide unmanned combat vehicles to enable users to assess the capability of the platforms and created new CONOPS and doctrine for manned/unmanned teaming based operations.  Efforts will inform new CONOPS, identified system limitations and benefits and provide an achievable, analytically backed basis for future RCV requirements documents to drive future acquisition programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds experimental prototyping and technical demonstrations of selected technologies conducted by Cross-Functional Teams (CFT) in order to inform and refine the development of initial capability documents in support of Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV), Future Vertical Lift (FVL), Network Command, Control Communication, and Intelligence (NC3I), Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (APNT), Air and Missile Defense (AMD), Soldier Lethality, and Synthetic Training Environment (STE). Funding facilitates the experimentation and demonstration of priority technologies to ensure that planned capabilities are technologically feasible, affordable, and available to Soldiers. Benefits include the narrowing of capability gaps by developing capability documents and rapidly transitioning leader-approved capability requirements to the Army Acquisition System. In project CF1, CFT will conduct pre-Materiel Solution Analysis Phase experimentation and technical demonstrations to enable capability document development and improve the decision making for potential programs of record.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Terrestrial Layer System (TLS) provides Army maneuver forces integrated full spectrum Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Cyber-enabling non-kinetic offensive operation options to Brigade Combat Team (BCT) and Expeditionary-Military Intelligence Brigade (EMIB) commanders. TLS' information superiority provides Indications and Warnings, Force Protection and Situational Awareness to influence the commander's decision cycle, improve targeting timeliness and accuracy, and provide the maneuver commander with electronic attack and offensive cyber warfare options to deny, degrade, disrupt, or otherwise manipulate the targeted force. TLS employs technologically advanced systems with a modular open-system approach for multiple operation configurations that can be efficiently sustained and effectively upgraded to provide capabilities against changing near peer and emerging threats to address multi-domain capability gaps.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These efforts will be used, but are not limited to identify, develop, prototype, evaluate, analyze, and demonstrate potential capabilities and alternative solutions. These efforts will quantify the respective maturity and effectiveness to mitigate capability gaps against changing near peer representative enemy target sets and operational scenarios. Enhanced capability and other technologies to provide overmatch capabilities will be evaluated for merit and will provide increased performance for production of TLS systems in FY 2022.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The US Army Tactical Space Strategy provides Tactical Land Component Forces with space capabilities required to enable force projection and maneuver during Multi-Domain Operations.  US Army space-based sensors will integrate with commercial and national systems to provides resilient communications, assured PNT and deep sensing capabilities required in the targeting process to enable rapid and responsive sensor-to-shooter applications required to engage and defeat Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) forces and enable force projection and maneuver in contested Multi-Domain Operations
The LEO Satellite Capability will provide prototyping, development and experimentation of the Tactical Space Layer (TSL) sensors which are designed to provide wide-area, responsive deep area sensing required for beyond line of sight (BLOS) targeting and force maneuver, significantly reducing Sensor to Shooter (S2S) timelines. Follow-on persistent prototype tactical sensor capabilities will be operational in FY 2021/2022 and will be integrated with the Army Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) ground station to tactically task, receive and disseminate data to directly support live-fire S2S demonstrations and assessments.
All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 633463 (Tag, Track and Locate). The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command in Huntsville, AL. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides funding for analytical support of Analysis of Alternatives. Analyses of Alternatives are statutory requirements for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and regulatory for all other programs. Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, Analyses of Alternatives are required to be completed for a new start program prior to its first Milestone Decision. The PE provides analytical capability for Pre-Milestone A programs that emerge outside the normal budget or POM cycles. Normally these programs are without program managers and require analysis to support Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leader's requirement and acquisition needs and priorities. The Analyses of Alternatives support the preparation of the Capability Development Document, Key Performance Parameters and Thresholds values and tradeoff analysis. The cited work is consistent with the Army Futures Command Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Guidance. Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as The Research and Analysis Center and Data and Analysis Center. The Army is projecting to start work on multiple Analyses of Alternatives beginning in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21), and will assess and fund the highest Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leader's priorities during the year of execution.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2019 funding supports Analysis of Alternatives for new start programs that do not yet have a Program Manager assigned and to augment PM funds where requirement decisions drive changes in scope or increased fidelity to achieve Congressional intent and interest.  Analysis of Alternatives initiation, scope, and fidelity are determined through the AROC process prior to the materiel development decision. Current projections indicate multiple new start programs will need to start their Analysis of Alternatives in FY 2019, including Unified Network Operations, Common Operating Environment, Cyberspace Situational Understanding, Offensive Cyberspace Operations, Mobile Armored Combat Earthmover, and Synthetic Training Environment.  In addition, several Analyses of Alternatives started in FY 2018 will continue to require analysis funding into FY 2019, to include Vehicle Protection Suite, Terrestrial Layer Intelligence Support for Multi-Domain Battle/Joint Combined Army Maneuver, Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System, and Advanced Threat Detection System.  In the Spring of 2018 (on or about 1 May) we will provide the Committee an updated listing of projected FY 2019 new start program Analyses of Alternatives.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2020 funding supports analysis for new start programs that do not yet have a program manager assigned and to augment program manager funds where requirement decisions drive changes in scope or increased fidelity to achieve Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leaders priority intent and interest. The analysis initiation, scope, and fidelity are determined in accordance with U.S. Army Future Command processes prior to the Materiel Development Decision and synchronized to support Joint and Army Requirement Oversight Councils' (JROC and AROC) and Acquisition Executive/Program decisions.  Current projections indicate multiple new start programs will need to start their Analysis of Alternatives in FY 2020, including Unified Network Operations, Terrain Shaping Obstacles, Aircraft Survivability Equipment, Next Generation Aerial ISR/MDSS, Maneuver Short Range Air Defense, Assured Positioning, Navigation Timing, Precision Strike Missile, Terrestrial Layer Intelligence Support for Multi-Domain Battle/Joint Combined Army Maneuver, Robotic Combat Vehicle, and Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System. In addition, several Analyses of Alternatives started in FY 2019 will continue to require analysis funding into FY 2020, to include Next Generation Combat Vehicle, Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, and Future Vertical Lift, Future Attack Recon Aircraft Capability Set 1. In the Spring of 2020 (on or about 1 May) we can provide, as desired, the Committee an updated listing of projected FY 2020 new start program Analyses of Alternatives.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Rucksack Portable Unmanned Aircraft System (RPUAS) Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (FoSUAS) provides battalion and below ground maneuver elements with critical situational awareness and enhanced force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnaissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the FoSUAS products.

The RPUAS FoSUAS provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements with an organic, on-demand, asset to develop situational awareness, enhance force protection, and secure routes, points, and areas. The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnaissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.   The RPUAS FoSUAS includes a combination of three separate hand-launched mission specific configurable aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery. The three separate mission specific configurable Unmanned Aircraft (UA) are the Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR), the Medium Range Reconnaissance (MRR), and the Long Range Reconnaissance (LRR).  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable handheld ground control station (H-GCS) which incorporates the Tactical Open Government Owned Architecture (TOGA).  FoSUAS will utilize existing RQ-11 in a system of systems fielding concept, with SRR and LRR options under development.

Justification: FY 2021 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Base funding of $1.379 million for Program Management Engineering support and to meet Capabilities Production Document (CPD) Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to conduct advanced component development activities for SRR and LRR and efforts to evaluate LRR prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS) is a critical system in the Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) concept that will employ MDO capabilities at all echelons and allow ground based forces to project power from land into other domains to defeat highly capable enemies, secure terrain, and consolidate gains. FUAS encompasses an array of capabilities from platoon soldiers to Division Commanders. The Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved the FUAS Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) on 6 Mar 2019. The FUAS ICD includes requirements for Future Tactical UAS (FTUAS), Air Launched Effects (ALE), and Scalable Control Interface (SCI). Manned, optionally-manned, and unmanned systems will penetrate defense-in-depth environments by employing ALE with teaming and swarming effects to detect, decoy, jam radar and communications, conduct cyber-attack, spoof and jam Global Positioning System (GPS), and kinetic engagement.

The Future Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team (FVL CFT) FUAS line of effort is comprised of multiple components including the FTUAS for the Brigade Combat Team (BCT), and ALE. The FTUAS seeks to replace the RQ-7Bv2 Shadow assets within the BCTs. Key attributes of the FTUAS BCT focus on Rapid Deployability, Expeditionary Maneuver, and Mobility for adaptive and agile operations. FTUAS will consist of an aircraft subsystem that will include the airframe, propulsion, avionics, communications, navigation, and software systems; aircraft-specific ground support equipment including power generation, transportation, or command and control equipment; aircraft software; and required engineering, logistics, programmatic support.  ALE extends tactical and operational reach, lethality, and protection to the advanced team as an attritable or optionally recoverable aerial capability that detects, identifies, locates, and reports threats; represents a credible decoy; disrupts threat communication, targeting and acquisition systems; and delivers lethal and non-lethal effects against those threats across Multi-Domain Operations.  

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 FTUAS Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Base funding of $40.122 million will be utilized for the following: 1) $16.797 million to support the FTUAS early development, 2) $20.000 million to support ALE Systems Analysis, 3) $3.325 million provides Systems Engineering and Program Management (SEPM) to support FTUAS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Aviation Platform - Requirements Development Division (AP-RDD) prepared an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that was approved by the AROC on 6 Mar 2019.

The FVL CFT is overseeing a demonstration effort in FY 2019 - 2021 that will inform the FTUAS requirement to develop capability that will ultimately replace the RQ-7Bv2 Shadow TUAS within the BCT formation. The Demonstration effort will focus on conducting analysis and obtaining field data that will inform the FTUAS Capability Development Document (CDD). A MDD review will be held in FY 2021.

AP-RDD - Prepared ALE Initial Capability Refinement Document (ICRD) that was approved by GEN John M. Murray, CG, AFC on 21 Oct 2019.

The plan to acquire ALE is through an incremental approach that allows rapid prototyping and fielding of technology to field available capabilities while continuing S&amp;T efforts to mature and transition emerging technologies to fully realize required capabilities. This is accomplished through multiple prototype development activities for the air vehicle, payloads, and mission system architecture through, experiments, simulations, and demonstrations conducted in parallel and/or sequential timelines. The objective of this incremental effort is to develop and exhibit multiple ALE prototypes to enable a rapid transition from prototype to operational implementation in the force. Increment 1A will be a COTS/GOTS system to enable technology maturation, systems integration, and potential initial capabilities. ALE program of record will be purpose built utilizing parallel efforts informed by S&amp;T investments and information learned from the demonstration and testing of Increment 1A. Additional increments will leverage the mission system architecture, payload technologies and interfaces from the initial increment and seek to extend the range of ALE for missions in support of LRPF.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Lower Tier Air Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) program will provide the required sensing capabilities, surveillance and fire control in the lower tier portion of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) of the ballistic missile defense battlespace. The acquisition program competitively selected the LTAMDS prime vendor in 1st Quarter (Q) Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 to build six Production Representative Unit sensors under the authority of Section 804 Rapid Prototyping.  The sensor/radar set (RS) replaces the baseline PATRIOT RS (AN/MPQ-65A) in an IAMD enabled PATRIOT Battalion mitigating the risk associated with threat changes while also addressing growing obsolescence and increasing Operational &amp; Support (O&amp;S) cost. The LTAMDS capability addresses critical capability gaps, modernizes technology, and increases reliability and maintainability. The LTAMDS capability increases sensor/radar performance to maximize the inherent PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhanced (MSE) Interceptor capabilities to engage threats.

FY 2021 base dollars in the amount of $376.373 million supports the acceleration of the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) program. FY 2021 tasks include Production Representative Units manufacturing (purchase of 3 prototypes, final phase of Contractor Verification Testing and initial Government Developmental Testing and Qualification Testing events), acquiring targets, acquiring long lead items, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I), and supporting programmatic and engineering activities needed to integrate the LTAMDS equipment with the Integrated Battle Command System, the PAC-3 Interceptor, and the Integrated Fire Control Network relay.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) satisfies the Warfighter's capability requirements in the Integrated Air and Missile Defense domain. The program provides the required sensing capabilities in the lower tier portion of the air and missile defense battlespace and expands the battlespace for the PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor, and will be upgradable for the Future Interceptor. The Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved LTAMDS requirements in April 2016. 

The Army competitively selected the LTAMDS, which will counter air and missile defense threats using state-of-the-art technology, while reducing operating and sustainment costs, mitigating obsolescence, and increasing reliability and maintainability. 

LTAMDS Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will be utilized for Production Representative Units manufacturing (final phase of Contractor Verification Testing and purchase of three prototypes), acquiring targets, acquiring long lead items, and supporting programmatic and engineering activities needed to integrate the LTAMDS equipment with the Integrated Battle Command System, the PAC-3 Interceptor, and the Integrated Fire Control Network relay. FY 2021 funding supports additional capabilities to meet full LTAMDS requirements, to include Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I). It further supports initial Government Developmental Testing and Qualification Testing events.  FY 2021 activities support the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requirement to accelerate LTAMDS Initial Operational Capability to no later than December 2023.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To enhance the Warfighter's lethality, survivability, and combat effectiveness, the Army used full and open competitive processes within Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements for rapid prototyping, qualification, and initial fielding efforts to meet the intent of FY 2018 NDAA Congressional language. Middle Tier Acquisition approach (Section 804, FY 2016 NDAA) authorities were leveraged in conjunction with the OTA to facilitate and accelerate the LTAMDS program. OTA promotes non-traditional defense contractor involvement, cost sharing arrangements, and accelerates schedules. A FEDBIZOPS announcement and subsequent LTAMDS Industry Day generated government-contractor dialogue, provided contractor cost and schedule estimates, verified industry technology and manufacturing readiness, and informed stakeholders on design approaches and potential materiel solutions. This approach also provides senior leader decision points along the way to make informed decisions based on industry ability to meet threshold requirements. The Sense-Off conducted in 3rd Quarter (Q) FY 2019 along with industry proposals enabled the selection of an LTAMDS single vendor with the subsequent award of the OTA Agreement in 1Q FY 2020.  Planned demonstration of military utility of the LTAMDS PRUs occurs in 3Q FY 2022 during the Early User Test (EUT).  A planned Urgent Materiel Release decision point occurs in 1Q FY 2023 subsequent to a declaration of success for the Rapid Prototyping program evidenced by the EUT results.  The UMR decision point enables the decision for Rapid Fielding and the procurement of the follow on sixteen sensors planned in 1Q FY 2023.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds experimental prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced ground systems, aviation systems, command, control, communications &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment, precision weapons, High Energy Laser (HEL) systems, and Soldier equipment. Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios as well as the maturation and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Benefits include maturing technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, informing emerging requirements for future programs of record, and reducing technology risk in order to transition of leap-ahead capabilities into acquisition programs. Technology Maturation Initiative efforts mature and integrate advanced component technologies into system and sub-system technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes, which are then validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and programs of record. This PE provides the Army with an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts and acquisition programs.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this PE is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command (AFC), the Engineer Research Development Center (ERDC), and U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This Project is a New Start in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the Technology Maturation Initiative, which matures and integrates component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios. The Technology Maturation Initiative takes emerging Science and Technology (S&amp;T) products to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, integrating them into technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes that inform requirements and reduce the risk of technology insertion for future acquisition programs. This Initiative streamlines the development and insertion of mature technologies that support advanced ground systems; aviation systems; command, control, communication &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment; precision weapons; High Energy Laser (HEL) systems; and Soldier equipment. It provides the Army an improved mechanism for incorporating innovative technologies and advanced capabilities in the early stages of acquisition program planning, and more closely aligns high-priority S&amp;T products and future Programs of Record.

Army senior leadership approves Technology Maturation Initiative projects prior to budget year programming based on priority and opportunity, ensuring that demonstrations have a high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Approved Technology Maturation Initiative projects are typically 2-4 years in duration and are budgeted under Projects AX4, AX5, AX6, AX7, AX8, AX9, AY1, AY2, and AY3.

Program Element (PE) 0604115A Technology Maturation Initiatives
* Project DS3 Technology Maturation Initiatives</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the development and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Computation Prototyping Environment (CPE) provides the ability to validate platform design variations in a VPG, in a way that identifies potential performance and design failures, and assesses mitigating solutions and trades prior to cost-bearing production and manufacturing. Activities under this Project include the maturation and integration of physics-based, computational modeling with new advances in deep learning in order to provide the ability to virtually explore design tradespaces and understand possible defeat strategies. This Project leverages recent Department of Defense (DOD) advancements in large data tradespace analytics, high- fidelity physics-based modeling, deep learning techniques, high-performance computing capabilities, and inverse modeling approaches to enable rapid computational prototyping to inform emerging acquisition programs.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.

Work in this Project is performed by the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Program Element (PE) 0604115A Technology Maturation Initiatives
* Project DS3 Technology Maturation Initiatives</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project demonstrates a prototype close combat missile with a multi-pulse, boost-sustain flight propulsion system providing extended range and decreased time of flight. Activities mature proof-of-principle hardware into an integrated tactical-representative design, and demonstrate a prototype missile with lethality overmatch of emerging threats. Early prototyping work concludes in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) to mature technology and demonstrate needed Warfighter capability in advance of acquisition program of record.

Work in this PE complements PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology.

Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 this Project was realigned from:
Program Element (PE) 0604115A Technology Maturation Initiatives
* Project DS3 Technology Maturation Initiatives</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures, integrates, and demonstrates protection and survivability technologies as part of active protection systems (APS) prototyping for the Army's combat vehicles. Activities integrate complimentary survivability technologies to enable layers of enhanced protection capability, providing greater survivability against current and emerging advanced threats. This Project demonstrates a suite of technologies on a fielded combat vehicle platform using an APS common architecture, and defines component interface standards and specifications that enable adaptive APS solutions. Activities support the Army's APS strategy to maintain or reduce vehicle weight by reducing reliance on armor with other means such as sensing, warning, hostile fire detection, and active countermeasures.

Work in this Project is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) and transitions to PE 0604852A (Suite of Vehicle Protection Systems - EMD).

Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command (AFC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This is a new start in FY2021.

In Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20) this Project was realigned from:
Program Element (PE) 0604115A Technology Maturation Initiatives
* Project DS3 Technology Maturation Initiatives</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates an integrated a 50 kilowatt (kW)-class laser weapon system into a Stryker platform, providing a system-level, High Energy Laser (HEL) experimental prototype for demonstration in realistic operating environments. These demonstrations will inform requirements, decrease risk for future Army HEL acquisition programs, and support the future development of warfighter Tactics/Techniques/Procedures and Concept of Operations. HEL weapon systems are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to stockpile ordnance. A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); sensors; and optics for maneuvering Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs). Demonstrations will also inform potential future capability to defeat both fixed- and rotary-wing manned aircraft. Leveraging Government investments and Industry technology advancements, will review and select existing HEL subsystem designs for integration into a Stryker combat vehicle; will conduct integration and demonstration of a system-level HEL experimental prototype; and will provide assessment of technical performance in an operational environment.  This effort informs application of laser weapons to other combat platforms and rapid prototyping to units-of-action to meet emerging threats expressed in the National Defense Strategy.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this Project is performed by the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Program Element (PE) 0604115 Technology Maturation Initiatives
* Project DS3 Technology Maturation Initiatives

This Project completes in FY20.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and integrates next-generation 50mm weapon system technologies transitioned from under the Advanced Lethality and Accuracy System for Medium Caliber (ALAS-MC) advanced technology development effort into a vehicle-agnostic combat turret to inform requirements for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV). This Project integrates and assesses critical ALAS-MC 50mm technology components for on-the-move engagement of moving personnel and materiel targets, bringing the subsystem to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Under Advanced Targeting and Lethality Automated System (ATLAS), this Project matures and integrates advanced Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms to enable aided target detection/recognition capability for NGCV using next generation, multi-spectral electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) targeting sensors. AI/ML algorithms are integrated with real-time intelligent fire control and mission planning interfaces to demonstrate automated turret capabilities, and provide overmatch via reduced target acquisition and engagement timelines.

Work in this Project is related to and fully integrated with the efforts funded in PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) /  Project BF5 (Adv Lethality &amp; Accuracy Sys for Med Cal Adv Tech); and Project BG1 (Sensors for Auto Oper and Survivability Adv Tech.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this Project is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command (AFC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project will mature and demonstrate Manned Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) technologies in a realistic operating environment to drive down risk in three critical areas for ground MUMT: remote lethality, unmanned maneuver and network. These major technical hurdles will be addressed by integrating mature technologies into the MUMT Campaign of Learning through three, synergistic integration efforts: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)/ground platform integration, a transportable MUMT simulation environment, and an advanced interface for the Warfighter.  

Work within this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority for Next Generation Combat Vehicle.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this Project is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and integrates long-range armament technologies for both weapons and munitions to demonstrate potential deep strike objective capabilities from future cannon artillery systems. It will demonstrate revolutionary performance to support Long Range Fires by further developing, integrating, and demonstrating enhanced lethality and range extension solutions for cannon system performance with maximum effects. Strategic Long Range Cannon (SLRC) activities include integrating component technologies into sub-system and system-level experimental prototypes for novel cannon, munition, and fire control, including guidance and propulsion.

Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) activities mature, integrate, and demonstrate a novel sub-system for ammunition handling and a long-range artillery projectile to support prototyping and experimentation of a next-generation, extended range armaments system that will provide significantly increased range and accuracy without an increase in platform weight.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the maturation, integration, and demonstration of advanced technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes to support advanced ground systems; aviation systems; command, control, communication &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment; precision weapons, High Energy Laser (HEL) systems; and Soldier equipment. Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) efforts mature and integrate component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes are validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation and acquisition efforts to inform requirements for future programs of record and reduce the risk of technology insertion. These efforts are typically 2-4 years in duration, and are approved by Army senior leadership based on priority and opportunity, to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Activities include the maturation, integration, and demonstration of HEL prototype weapons performance on a combat platform in realistic operational environments in support of the Army's objective capability for Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD). A 50 kilowatt (kW)-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial systems(UASs), sensors, and optics for maneuvering brigade combat teams (BCTs). Activities also include sub-system prototyping and integration of leap-ahead ground combat vehicle powertrain technologies; and integration and demonstration of key Active Protection System (APS) components to provide modular and layered vehicle protection effects (hard-kill and soft-kill), enabling power projection and enhanced survivability. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms. This Project provides the Army with an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishing a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts and acquisition programs.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  Work in this Project is performed by the Army Futures Command (AFC); the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT); and the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).

Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Maneuver - Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) is an Air Defense weapon system consisting of multiple ground-to-air missile launchers, sensors and a gun on a Stryker A1 combat vehicle. M-SHORAD provides the Army improved capabilities for defense of maneuver formations and other tactical echelons from low altitude air attack and surveillance. Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten the ability of maneuver forces to conduct operations. Specifically, maneuver formations require the improved M-SHORAD air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.  

The M-SHORAD capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach with a rapidly fielded Initial M-SHORAD system (supported by an Army Approved Directed Requirement) and an enduring M-SHORAD (supported by a Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved Capability Development Document (CDD) that will field the full capability. First, the Army will field the Initial M-SHORAD solution based on a Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Directed Requirement, which was informed by the FY 2017 M-SHORAD Demonstration. This system will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include FW, RW, and Group 3 UAS while keeping pace and surviving with the maneuver Brigades. The Initial M-SHORAD will be fielded to four M-SHORAD battalions.  In addition, the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) will transition the Directed Energy M-SHORAD (DE M-SHORAD) to the M-SHORAD Product Office in 1 Quarter (QTR) FY 2023. DE M-SHORAD will provide the long term capability to counter a broader range of FW, RW, UAS and RAM threats.


FY 2021 to FY 2025 dollars are for the ENDURING M-SHORAD ( DE M-SHORAD, Maneuver Air Defense Technologies (MAD-T) missiles and DISMOUNTED M-SHORAD) development. .</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The M-SHORAD capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach with a rapidly fielded Initial M-SHORAD system (supported by an Army Approved Directed Requirement) and an enduring M-SHORAD (supported by a Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved Capability Development Document (CDD) that will field the full capability. First, the Army will field the Initial M-SHORAD solution based on a Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Directed Requirement, which was informed by the FY 2017 M-SHORAD Demonstration. This system will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include FW, RW, and Group 3 UAS while keeping pace and surviving with the maneuver Brigades.  In addition, the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) will transition the Directed Energy M-SHORAD (DE M-SHORAD) to the M-SHORAD Product Office in 1 Quarter (QTR) FY 2023. DE M-SHORAD will provide the long term capability to counter a broader range of FW, RW, UAS and RAM threats.


FY 2021 to FY 2025 dollars are for Enduring M-SHORAD (DE M-SHORAD, Maneuver Air Defense Technologies (MAD-T) missiles and DISMOUNTED M-SHORAD) development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) provides Army ground maneuver forces access to assured PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT Global Positioning System (GPS) may be limited or denied (jammed and spoofed).  A-PNT products are ruggedized tactical systems that enable Army forces at echelon the ability to shoot, move, communicate, and protect their forces to penetrate and dis-integrate enemy anti-access systems, thereby allowing them to maneuver from operational and strategic distances to close with, destroy, and exploit the enemy in close and deep maneuver areas with sufficient combat power, tempo, and momentum. A-PNT addresses two critical capability gaps: Access and Integrity. Access is the ability to retrieve accurate PNT information in a contested Electronic Warfare/Cyber environment. Integrity is the ability to trust the PNT information. PNT is a critical enabler of many Army Maneuver, Fires, and Command and Control systems that are dependent on accurate Position and Timing, and a foundational Multi-Domain Battle capability to support: calibrated force posture (position and maneuver across strategic distances); multi-domain formations (operate in contested spaces against near-peer adversaries); convergence (continuous integration of capabilities in all domains). The current Global Positioning System (GPS) capability is a fixed frequency system susceptible to electronic warfare and field environments (e.g. urban, dense vegetation).  

Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated 05 April 2010, approved the PNT Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT.   Army Futures Command approved the Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS) Directed Requirement (DR) on 13 January 2019. The Dismounted A-PNT System (DAPS) Directed Requirement was approved 05 April 2019. The Alternative Navigation (ALTNAV) Directed Requirement was approved in November 2019.  MAPS transitions to a Capability Development Document (CDD) in June 2020 and DAPS transitions in FY 2021.

A-PNT consists of four Projects; (BV4) Area Protection and Alternative Navigation (Alt Nav) Technology Development, (ED5) Assured PNT, (EH8) Dismounted A-PNT System (DAPS), and (EJ2) Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS).

Project Manager (PM) PNT manages these four Project areas (Area Protection and Alt Nav capabilities, Assured PNT, DAPS, and MAPS) constructed to investigate, prototype, experiment, model, assess, develop, modify, improve resiliency, test, equip, field, and sustain A-PNT solutions.

Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) consists of:

(BV4) - The Area Protection and Alt Nav Technology Development project supports the transition of technologies from industry, academia, and government Science &amp; Technology organizations, and consequent development of alternative and complementary PNT technologies for integration into Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS) and Dismounted A-PNT System (DAPS). Area Protection &amp; Alt Nav Technologies will be developed in order to demonstrate Alternative Navigation (ALTNAV), emerging complementary PNT, and net-enabled GPS solutions to provide Radio Frequency (RF) and non-RF threat mitigation.

(ED5) - The Assured PNT project funding line is for Resiliency and Software Assurance Measures (RSAM) software upgrades to legacy military GPS receivers. This line also supports the completion of network integration, installation and testing of ALTNAV signal enterprise build-out.

(EH8) - The Dismounted A-PNT System (DAPS) will provide the Soldiers equipped with Nett Warrior and other Soldier architecture compliant systems (e.g. Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS)) conducting operations outside of vehicles, unhindered access the critical timing and position data to effectively engage targets, share data across the network and conduct mission command functions.

(EJ2) - The Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS) is a platform-mounted, ruggedized tactical PNT system which provides electronic protection capabilities that provide Army forces the ability to move, shoot, communicate, and provide situational awareness in Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or denied environments. Included in the MAPS is the Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) which provides GPS signal point protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through Anti-Jam, non-Radio Frequency, and alternate navigation technologies. AJAS enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments. The AJAS will assist in delivering distributed assured PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner that allows for future modernization.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The primary focus of Area Protection and Alt Nav Technology Development project is to enable the effective transition of incremental and disruptive technologies to fieldable Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) solutions to pace or overmatch current and evolving threats. Program activities including advanced component development, prototyping, and demonstration will bridge the gap between advanced technology development (S&amp;T) and system development (products). It will demonstrate military utility to enable effective transitions and synergize development across products. It will also reduce or eliminate the transition of immature technologies to the product developer that potentially contribute to cost growth, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls.

Currently, military GPS is limited to two narrow frequency bands which could be defeated by our potential enemies. Additional Radio Frequency (RF) signals such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and other satellite communications (SATCOM) sources integrated into PNT products and user equipment will provide alternatives against GPS jamming through frequency and source diversity. This line supports the Alternative Navigation (ALTNAV) capability and complementary PNT technologies (such as RF and non-RF technologies). ALTNAV provides frequency and source diversity to enable Army users with accurate and trusted position and time information in GPS degraded environments. ALTNAV is an instantiation of a complementary PNT technology and will include network integration, installation and testing of the infrastructure capability and user equipment. Other efforts include the continuation of situational awareness development, spectrum modification for PNT solutions, and modeling and simulation support.

To support effective transition to Mounted Assured PNT System (MAPS) and Dismounted Assured PNT System (DAPS), while minimizing integration cost and schedule, the project will develop and deliver government-owned Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) compliant hardware &amp; software frameworks. Evolving standards from the PNT Reference Architecture (Software and/or Hardware) will be utilized ensuring a path to plug and play solutions. Utilization of these standards will be verified in the Modular Integration Lab.  Prior to transition, prototype compliance with a modular open suite of standards architecture will be demonstrated.

The development process will leverage commercial capabilities, existing contracts, industry, academia, DoD Science &amp; Technology and critical Soldier touchpoints in an iterative process to transition solutions into future products, concepts of operation, architectures, and platforms to assure PNT.

FY 2021 Base funds in the amount of $18.840 million will continue prototyping and evaluation of the ALTNAV capability. Funds will additionally be used for risk reduction efforts for complementary PNT technologies, modeling &amp; simulation, and technical &amp; operational demonstrations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The primary focus of Area Protection and Alt Nav Technology Development (BV4) project is to enable the effective transition of incremental and disruptive technologies from multiple sources (commercial capabilities, industry, academia, DoD Science &amp; Technology) to fieldable PNT solutions to pace or overmatch current and evolving threats.

The project includes prototyping or other demonstrations to prove out technology before it is integrated into a product. This is solidified by the following linkage:

- Modular GPS Independent Sensors (AW5 &amp; AW6)
- Navigation Warfare (AV8)
- Command, Control &amp; Platform Electronics tech (779)
- Tactical Command and Control (101)

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Area Protection &amp; Alt Nav Technology Development program will utilize rapid prototyping and modeling &amp; simulation to assess the military utility of the initial capabilities through critical Soldier touchpoints, laboratory, and field assessments to determine technology maturation for integration into Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing System (MAPS), Dismounted Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing System (DAPS), and other platforms. This will be implemented by utilizing a mix of competitive Other Transaction Authority (OTA)'s and Federal Acquisition Regulation contracts to obtain prototypes. This will inform the MAPS and DAPS CDD and other requirements documents for limited rate initial production, initial operational test &amp; evaluation, and the full rate production decision.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) project funds the Resiliency and Software Assurance Measures (RSAM) which provides increased capability and situational awareness for 500,000+ fielded legacy military Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers supporting systems and soldiers through at least 2035.  Legacy GPS receivers targeted for RSAM enhancements, include but are not limited to, 226,000 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) and 200,000+ embedded Ground Based-GPS Receiver Applications Module (GB-GRAM).  RSAM mitigates risks in a GPS-challenged operational environment until future Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) solutions are fully deployed.  Assured PNT enablers include prototype development and testing to demonstrate and prove emerging capabilities for legacy and future PNT resilient solutions.  Assured PNT enablers also include the final phase of Alternative Navigation signal enterprise build-out, providing PNT data in a denied or degraded environment.

FY 2021 base funds in the amount of $27.215 million support PNT software enhancements to Army PNT receivers and capabilities. RSAM will support continued software development of RSAM Update 2 against emerging threats to legacy military GPS receivers, to include prototype testing and risk mitigation efforts. RSAM will coordinate integrated software testing with military system managers and the test community to validate software and synchronize RSAM deployment to the user.  Assured PNT enablers include the final phase of network integration, installation and testing of Alternative Navigation signal enterprise build-out.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Dismounted Assured PNT (A-PNT) System (DAPS) implements congressional and OSD guidance to develop and field Military Code (M-Code) Ground User Equipment (MGUE) receivers and provides the Soldiers equipped with Nett Warrior (NW) and other Soldier architecture compliant systems (e.g. Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS)) the critical timing and position data to effectively engage targets, share data across the network, and conduct mission command functions. DAPS is planned to be a size, weight and power (SWaP) optimized form-factor that paces the threats and includes development and integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and non-GPS sensors. DAPS integrates with the NW system and other Soldier architecture compliant systems, and distributes PNT information to the End-User Device (EUD). DAPS includes receiver software capable of fusing sensors and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals resulting in additional integrity for military GPS in denied environments and includes a M-Code receiver solution, or a Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) system with growth path to M-Code.  

Through an iterative approach, DAPS will continue to fuse M-Code, GNSS, and non-GPS sensors, as well as fuse Alternate Navigation (ALTNAV) and other complementary PNT sources in a SWaP constrained system in order to pace/overmatch the threat and continue to deliver critical timing and position data to effectively engage targets, share data across the network, and conduct mission command functions.

FY 2021 Base funds in the amount of $13.337 Million will continue current DAPS prototype variants, followed by final acceptance testing and certification. Funds will converge ALTNAV and complementary PNT hardware and software for planned and emerging DAPS improvements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Risk reduction prototyping efforts from 0604120A BV4 Area Protection and Alt Nav Technology Development will transition PNT Modernization/complementary PNT capabilities to the Dismounted A-PNT System (DAPS).</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DAPS strategy consists of the continuous refinement of the current DAPS material solution through an operational approach that incorporates congressionally and OSD mandated transition to M-Code and includes minimizing risk to the operational force by delivering the best available technology to fulfill critical capability gaps that outpace emerging threat environments. DAPS will provide the Soldier conducting operations outside of vehicles the means to maintain accurate position, velocity,and time information in a Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or degraded/denied environments where space based PNT may be limited or denied. DAPS will provide improved performance over the currently fielded Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR).

DAPS will use an iterative acquisition approach and is structured to incrementally develop, deliver and field DAPS capabilities through continued development of emerging technologies. Follow-on capabilities will build on the previous technology and incorporate complementary PNT technologies as they mature. This "buildingblock" approach will continue until DAPS capabilities fully meet the requirements.

The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps. Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units. This will be implemented by utilizing Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements and/or other FAR based mechanisms to competitively obtain prototypes. The Government will conduct laboratory, performance and field testing. The findings from these efforts will provide technology viability and allow for the transition to limited production. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing System (MAPS) implements congressional and OSD guidance to develop and field M-code Ground User Equipment (MGUE) receivers and provides the Army's ground maneuver forces access to assured PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT Global Positioning System (GPS) may be limited or denied. A-PNT products are ruggedized tactical systems which provides electronic protection capabilities that enable Army forces the ability to move, shoot, communicate, and provide situational awareness in Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or denied environments. MAPS addresses two critical capability gaps: Access and Integrity. Access is the ability to retrieve PNT information in a contested Electronic Warfare/Cyber environment. Integrity is the ability to trust the PNT information. PNT is a critical enabler of many Army Maneuver, Fire and Command and Control systems that are dependent on accurate Position and Timing. Included in the MAPS is the Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) which provides GPS signal point protection. The AJAS will assist in delivering distributed assured PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner that allows for future modernization.

FY 2021 Base dollars in the amount of $68.733 million support system engineering and management support, integration, testing and training of the MAPS capability for client platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MAPS acquisition strategy consists of the continuous refinement of the current MAPS material solution through an operational approach that incorporates congressionally and OSD mandated transition to M-code and includes minimizing risk to the operational force by delivering the best available technology to fulfill critical capability gaps that outpace emerging threat environments. The MAPS program will utilize the iterative approach by continuous frontloading of operational assessments, Soldier touchpoints, and evaluations to finalize decisions for the MAPS material solution to one vendor design. MAPS is leveraging competitive Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements to prototype and assess industry capabilities. MAPS will conduct Electromagnetic Interference and Environmental Testing, as well as performance testing in the System Integration Lab (SIL), anechoic chamber testing and an Operational Technical Demonstration in the most affordable manner that allows for future modernization. Both the Capability Development Document and the Basis of Issue Plan will be approved in FY2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will enable leaders, Soldiers, and units to train where they will fight, along with their partners with whom they will fight, in complex operational environments to include dense urban, woodland, jungle, dessert, and sub-terrain, before they get there.  The STE will operate within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi-Domain Operations.  STE is currently a pre-acquisition effort leveraging Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs) on the path to Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in FY 2021.  This collective training capability will revolutionize Army training by providing the repetitions and sets necessary to achieve improved proficiency prior to live training and combat; thereby improving Soldier lethality and survivability.  The STE will be available where training occurs (home station, combat training centers, armories, institutions, ship-board, deployed).

STE is comprised of three main Lines of Effort: 1) STE-Information System; 2) Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers (RVCT), both air and ground; and 3) Soldier / Squad Virtual Trainer (SSVT). STE-IS (delivers the Common Synthetic Environment, like an operating system), consisting of Global Terrain/One World Terrain (OWT), Training Simulation Software (TSS), and Training Management Tools (TMT). The RVCT Air and Ground (RVCT A/G) will collectively train units, using proponent developed Combined Arms Training Strategies (CATS), on a simulated, fully interactive, real-time battlefield.  S/SVT is broken into Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) and Soldier Virtual Trainer (SVT). SiVT, which is the immersive training capability delivered as part of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) provides initial squad training capability for S/SVT in Increment 1.  SVT will support Army wide formations such as artillery, Military Police, and units for Weapons Skills Development, Joint Fires Training and Use of Force.  Future lines of effort under market research include the integration of Live training and Next Generation Constructive.  The STE will be cloud-enabled, compatible with the Army Enterprise Network, and service-based through the Common Operating Environment, and will include  the future Live and Constructive capabilities. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.

FY 2021 base funding of $129.547 million will finalize the technical  development and demonstration of prototype designs to deliver IOC at 5 installations (Ft. Hood, JBLM, Ft. Leonard wood, Ft. Benning, and Ft. Drum) for STE-IS, RVCT, and SiVT (IVAS). Funds will also support conducting a Limited User Test (LUT) to verify and validate the capabilities of TSS, TMT, OWT and RVCT as an integrated prototype solution in the CSE.  This effort will reduce technical risk, validate design, validate cost estimates and refine requirements for future STE, S/SVT and Live capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The STE will be a single, yet comprehensive interconnected training system that provides a Common Synthetic Environment (CSE), in which air and ground units from crew/section through Army Service Component Command (ASCC) conduct realistic multi-echelon / multi-domain combined arms maneuver, air ground integration, and mission command training. All of these components are interconnected and based off of a standard, modular and open system architecture model. The focus of the FD6 project is on the STE-IS and RVCT components of the holistic training strategy. The STE-IS provides a common software environment consisting of the Training Management Tool (TMT), Training Simulation Software (TSS), and One World Terrain (OWT) solution. The Training Management Tool (TMT) is the capability that enables units to quickly plan collective training events, prepare training events; execute and monitor events, and assess event results and readiness.

The Training Simulation Software (TSS), the core STE simulation engine, provides a realistic STE-IS that enables collective training from Soldier/Squad through ASCC. The STE-IS is a dynamic, digital representation of the Operational Environment (OE) and the military capabilities in the scenario. The TSS provides entity, aggregate, and common services, as well as adjudicates STE-IS interactions at the entity level (e.g., Computer-Generated Forces (CGF), and synthetic equipment).

The One World Terrain (OWT) is a 3-Dimensional global terrain capability and associated information services that supports the virtual replication of the physical Earth and complexities of the Operational Environment in support of training in the STE. The STE and RVCT requirements, which are codified in abbreviated Capabilities Development Documents (CDD-A) with full versions currently in staffing, directly support the Army Collective Training Environment - Initial Capabilities Document (ACTE-ICD) as the Army's cornerstone for replicating the Operational Environment (OE) during training events enabling the Army to train as it fights. Separate, but interoperable, RVCT systems are required for both air and ground collective training. The Air RVCT will represent the U.S. Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserves fleet of rotary wing aircraft, and specified U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft. The Ground RVCT will represent ground/amphibious track and wheeled vehicles from the U.S. Army, Army National Guard, Special Operations Units and the USMC.

FY 2020 Update: STE User Assessment conducted in Apr-May 2019 further refined the requirement and demonstrated that the technology was quickly maturing and provided better costing data for STE.  In June 2019, the contracting command awarded five subsequent STE OTAs for the STE-IS, RVCT, and S/SVT (Weapons Optimization) to seven vendors allowing better refinement of the technical requirements needed to achieve IOC in 4Q 2021.  The focus of FY 2020 is on development and technical user assessments leading to a successful Limited User Test and Initial Operating Capability for the STE-IS and RVCT components in FY 2021.  

FY 2021 base funding of $122.553 million will finalize the technical development and demonstration of prototype designs to deliver IOC at 5 installations (Ft. Hood, Joint Base Lewis McCord, Ft. Leonard Wood, Ft. Benning, and Ft. Drum) for STE-IS and RVCT. In addition, funds support conducting a Limited User Test (LUT) to verify and validate the capabilities of STE-IS and RVCT as an integrated prototype solution with military utility. This effort will reduce technical risk, validate design, validate cost estimates and refine requirements for future STE, S/SVT and Live capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>STE will be developed and acquired as an incrementally deployed software intensive program leveraging accelerated acquisition authorities when appropriate. To ensure speed and agility to deliver and modernize STE, a modular open systems architecture (MOSA) will be developed enabling the Army to exploit rapid advancements in cutting-edge commercial visualization and immersion technologies. STE will employ an IT Box requirements model to enable agile development of the STE-IS with parallel incremental development of the RVCT A/G and S/SVT. This model facilitates leveraging commercial and Government technology development that are necessary for future Live and Constructive centered increments. Other acquisition elements such as testing, contracting, and technology transition will consider any and all means available to innovate and incorporate complementary support to add momentum in this approach.

STE Increment 1 IOC is programmed for 4Q 2021. IOC is defined as the first fielding and acceptance of the STE-IS capability at installations identified IAW the Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP). IOC fielded STE systems will include the following attributes: verification, validation and accreditation process complete; STE-IS capabilities in support of RVCT A/G and Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) IOC in FY 2021 and ultimately the Soldier Virtual Trainer (SVT) IOC in FY 2023; meeting Information Assurance and Risk Management Framework requirements. New Equipment Training (NET) will include the capability to support the RVCT, and the ability to provide initial sustainment via interim contractor support (ICS). Soldiers will interface with the STE-IS through the Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainer (RVCT) and SiVT via the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS).

Future phases currently under market research will provide Soldier/Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT) capabilities and integrate Live training components as well as Next Generation Constructive (NGC).

Five (5) OTAs were awarded in FY 2019 in support of STE prototype initiatives: STE-IS (TSS/TMT, OWT), RVCT, Live (market research only), and SVT Weapons Optimization (market research only). Confidence events and evaluations were built into the OTAs to determine the readiness and availability of technology in support of 4Q 2021 IOC. Prime(s) and Sub-vendors will execute the STE agreement(s) through an Agile development process with established success criteria and their DevOps processes. Vendors will continually include the Government and all stakeholders (Internal and external) in the Agile development process. This process will ensure all parties have transparency and early input into the modular design effort in order to support success of the product(s) being developed for the STE.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States Army identified a near term requirement for a Soldier and Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT) to address the small unit collective training gaps, and to merge the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) II, Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) III, and the current non program of record Use-of-Force trainer into a single program starting in FY 2021. The S/SVT is the next generation trainer that enables Soldiers/Marines to conduct squad, weapons, and joint fires training, as well as rehearse lethal and non-lethal use-of-force interactions prior to live events to measure the unit's Mission Essential Task List proficiency, which then provide a unit's Objective 'T' readiness.

S/SVT is comprised of Squad Immersive Trainer (SiVT); also commonly referred to as both the IVAS and the Soldier Virtual Trainer (SVT) capabilities. The first increment of the SSVT, which is the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) capability, integrates into the Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.0 as part of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). Increments 2 and 3 of S/SVT combines individual Soldier and squad training into a single capability and includes STE Squad Capability (SSC), Weapon Skill Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF), which integrate the NEXTGEN Marksmanship and the NEXTGEN Call For Fire Artillery Virtual Training capability into the STE baseline.
The second phase; the SVT system design combines and integrates several individual Soldier and squad training capabilities, Weapon Skills Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF).

S/SVT is dependent and interconnected through the STE-IS software baseline. The STE-IS core cross-cutting capabilities deliver software, application(s) and services that optimize cloud-enabled capability simulation processing to Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainer (RVCT), Soldier Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT), and the future Next Generation Constructive (NGC) capability to include Force-on-Force (FoF) and Force-on-Target (FoT) Live training instrumentation.

FY 2021 funding of $6.994 million reinitiates the market research and prototype solutions for the SVT solution assessing industry and academia's technical readiness and availability around Weapons Skills Development, Joint Fires and Use of Force.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The S/SVT uses the Synthetic Training Environment (STE) modular open systems architecture via virtual interface and hardware standards. S/SVT optimizes training delivery through the employment of a combination of Operational Environment (OE) mixed reality visualization and Natural User Interface (NUI) technologies to maximize efficiencies for the integration of system capabilities. The S/SVT system design combines and integrates several individual Soldier and squad training capabilities, Weapon Skill Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF), into a single capability that can be conducted simultaneously or individually and enable physical movement/exertion related to the execution of Soldier/Marine individual and squad collective training tasks. The system is required to be man transportable and deployable worldwide. It delivers training at the Point of Need (PoN) supporting Army-wide formations such as artillery, Military Police, and units for weapons skills development.

Two (2) OTAs awarded in FY 2019 in support of S/SVT prototype initiatives: SiVT (IVAS) Holistic Joint with Soldier Lethality, and SVT Weapons Optimization (market research only). Confidence events and evaluation criteria were built into the OTAs to determine technical availability and readiness in support of 4Q 2021 IOC. Prime(s) and Sub-vendors will execute the agreement(s) through an Agile development process with established success criteria and their DevOps processes. Vendors will continually include the Government and all stakeholders (Internal and external) in the Agile development process. This process will ensure all parties have transparency and early input into the design effort and success of the product(s) being developed for the STE.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This Program Element is a New Start for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) develops prototypes and demonstrates technology for detecting and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). The goal of this Project is to mature technology to increase the ability of deployed forces to positively identify IEDs with minimal false alarms and increase the rate of advance of route clearance missions. Additionally the objective is to positively neutralize or mitigate the effects of IEDs with minimal collateral damage.  Driven by the current threat facing deployed U.S. forces, this PE enables rapid development and delivery of capabilities that  enable the detection, neutralization, and risk mitigation of IEDs and their effects.  These technologies are intended to be matured and demonstrated for integration onto existing Department of Defense weapon systems.  

This PE is coordinated with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD/R&amp;E) including the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).

Work in this PE was previously conducted under PE 0604134BR, Counter Improvised-Threat Technology Demonstration, Prototype Development, and Testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Project HX1 Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon funds the RCCTO to field an experimental/prototype Hypersonic Weapon System with residual combat capability at the Battery Level as part of the Strategic Fires Battalion in support of Multi-domain Operations.  The Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system will provide the Army a prototype strategic attack weapon system to defeat Anti Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities, suppress adversary Long Range Fires, and engage other high payoff/time critical targets.  LRHW is common with other Department of Defense (DoD) hypersonic programs using the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, and the Navy 34.5 inch booster.  Additionally the LRHW will include an existing Army Battle Fire Control system.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Expanded Mission Area Missile (EMAM) program supports the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture and provides Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) the kinetic intercept capability to defeat Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats.

The IFPC Inc 2 will provide a ground-based weapon system designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat the CM, UAS, and RAM threats. The IFPC Inc 2 requirement consists of a launcher, integrated fire control, sensor, and an interceptor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission and Objective counter-RAM mission with alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. 

EMAM is no longer acting as a separate program. EMAM will be incorporated into the IFPC Inc 2 program as a potential primary interceptor for the future Enduring IFPC Inc 2 system and provide kinetic intercept capability to defeat CM, UAS and RAM threats. EMAM is now known as the IFPC Inc 2 Interceptor with strategy and funding combined with the IFPC Inc 2 program beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. The IFPC Inc 2 systems will be integrated with the Army IAMD Command and Control (C2) architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To provide improved operational effectiveness, the Army will use the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) OTA to execute a competitive initial concept definition (CD) with multiple contractors. From the CD phase, rapid prototype development approaches will utilize detailed modeling and simulation of the future interceptor as well as conduct prototype development of high-risk hardware technologies. The prototype technologies and detailed simulation based interceptor design will be used to competitively down select to a single vendor. This approach and the resulting technologies and designs will inform the selection of Acquisition Strategy (traditional or 804 Middle Tier) most advantageous for this project.  This PB21 submission presents R-4 and R-4a schedule information in traditional acquisition terminology that will be updated with 804 Middle Tier terminology if utilized.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funds supporting CFT Network efforts were previously requested in program Cross Functional Team (CFT) Advanced Development &amp; Prototyping, OSD PE 0604020A.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Unified Network Transport is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1 Unified Network; LOE 2, Common Operating Environment (COE), LOE 3, Interoperability; and LOE 4, Command Post Mobility and Survivability. These efforts support advanced component development activities that are aligned to the Army's Tactical Network Capability Set development and fielding plans.

The Network Cross-Functional Team (N-CFT) engages in technology demonstrations, focused evaluations, and expert analysis to inform future requirements, mature technologies, and deliver new capabilities. Subsequent to a decision for materiel development, the N-CFT develops and refines capability documentation aligned with the appropriate transition approach.  The N-CFT will inform technology transitions, research and development, and user assessments, and then rapidly transition to appropriate Programs of Record.

FY 2021 funds will support identification, maturation, demonstration, and evaluation of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6+ systems and subsystem components including, but not limited to, resilient Line of Site (LOS) and beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications, information systems and information management; cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA) situational understanding and operations; intelligence fusion, cloud technologies, virtual augmentation, artificial intelligence, and data convergence and analytics in the Common Operating Environment to inform the Integrated Tactical Network/Enterprise Network and Enabling Functions, Computing Environments, Interoperability and Command Posts. Successful solutions identified through evaluation in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment will be transitioned to Programs of Record for integration and fielding. Funds will also support integration with solutions identified in the other Modernization CFT efforts to ensure network dependencies are addressed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Interoperability is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1 and 2, Unified Network Transport and Common Operating Environment, respectively.  These efforts support advanced component development activities that are aligned to the Army's Tactical Network Capability Set development and fielding plans.

The project enables Unified Action Partner Interoperability through integration into the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the Mission Partner Environment (MPE). Interoperability is the ability to routinely act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve tactical, operational, and strategic objectives. Interoperability between disparate forces allows coalitions to produce greater combat power than the sum of their parts by leveraging relative strengths while mitigating relative weaknesses.

Funding is used for technical maturation and evaluation of  technologies to address gaps associated with LOE 3, Interoperability, solutions that will incorporate common commercial standards and/or widely recognized military interoperability standards. This funding will support demonstrations and experimentation, in a relevant operational environment, of key research and development (R&amp;D) and science and technology (S&amp;T) initiatives related to this effort, to include communications, information systems and information management; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; intelligence fusion and digital fires.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These efforts support advanced component development activities that are directly aligned to the Army's Tactical Network Capability Set development and fielding plans.

This project supports mobile Command Post efforts and is directly aligned with the Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2). The technical maturation and evaluation allow for Command Post disaggregation capabilities to inform future designs. Spectrum obfuscation and assessments of antenna remoting will support the Command Post efforts for CPI2 Increment 2 and beyond.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Effort includes evaluation for tactically employable Command Post (CP) disaggregation capabilities, will also allow for the integration of spectrum obfuscation modes of employment for limited radio frequency emissions capabilities into a tactically deployable CP and assess antenna remoting solutions, and will enable integration of Mission Partner Environment hardware components into the CP.  These efforts will be demonstrated and evaluated with FORSCOM and inform the program technical baseline and DOTMLPF. Will conduct iterative Technical Exchange Meetings with Industry that will assess, demonstrate, prototype, and integrate emerging industry solutions to mature Command Post capabilities. Efforts will inform the requirements for a survivable and effective mobile Command Post in a contested and congested environment.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Integrated Tactical Network/Enterprise Network is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1 Unified Network. These efforts support advanced component development activities that are aligned to the Army's Tactical Network Capability Set development and fielding plans.

This funding will inform design decisions for future tactical network capability sets in the areas of Aerial Tier, LEO, MEO, GEO high throughput satellite capabilities, cyber hardened communications, and resilient Line of Site (LOS) and beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) waveforms through evaluation and technical maturation. It will increase bandwidth and range; improve mobility and network security; harden the network and support interoperability with Joint and Unified Action Partners.  

This project enables a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide and in any environment. It includes the development of a standards-based network architecture that unifies enterprise and deployed network capabilities and features a unified transport layer, network operations and other enabling functions that allows integration of disparate networks. The Army network will provide resiliency through path diversity and dynamic routing to ensure tactical units can communicate in hostile environments. It will provide multiple ways to communicate and give commanders the ability to choose their communications methods and tools during operations. It fully incorporates cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.  The ITN/IEN enables Unified Action Partner Interoperability through integration into the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).  Interoperability is the ability to routinely act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve tactical, operational, and strategic objectives. Interoperability between disparate forces allows coalitions to produce greater combat power than the sum of their parts by leveraging relative strengths while mitigating relative weaknesses.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This funding is used to identify and acquire technologies to address gaps associated with LOE 1, Unified Network, for evaluation and demonstration in the overall Integrated Network. The Unified Network LOE enables a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide and in any environment. This will require the creation of a standards-based network architecture that effectively integrates enterprise and deployed network capabilities across domains and environments, and features a unified transport layer that permits "plug and play" for specific network capabilities. LOE 1 addresses the following operational requirements: Converged Mission Command Network, Network Augmentation / Extension, and Synthetic Training Environment.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Integrated Base Defense (IBD) provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection framework focused on system engineering and software development.

Counter Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (CVBIED) is an integrated suite of systems developed in response to CENTCOM JUONS CC-0540. CVBIED provides an early VBIED detection capability prior to vehicles reaching entry into Forward Operating Bases. Additional sensor systems are being integrated into the current Force Protection infrastructure as part of CVBIED.

Counter Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (CVBIED) is not a new start, the program was moved from Program Element 0605033A in FY 2018 and 0205402A in FY 2019.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Integrated Base Defense (IBD) provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection framework focused on system engineering and software development.
Counter Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (CVBIED) is an integrated suite of systems developed in response to CENTCOM JUONS CC-0540. CVBIED provides an early VBIED detection capability prior to vehicles reaching entry into Forward Operating Bases. Additional sensor systems are being integrated into the current Force Protection infrastructure as part of CVBIED.

OCO funding in the amount of $2.020 million supports continued integration of CVBIED technologies into the current Force Protection infrastructure to address capabilities gaps with JUONS CC-0540.

Counter Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (CVBIED) is not a new start, the program was moved from Program Element 0605033A in FY 2018 and 0205402A in FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) supports the United States Cyber Command (USCC) by enabling a critical need for the DoD Cyber Mission Force (CMF) to train at the individual, team, and force level.  The service cyber components have established their own training environments, but do not have standardized capabilities or content. PCTE will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) cyber forces with a standardized training capability that utilizes shared content across the Services to include emulated network environments and has the ability to connect to other range environments.. The PCTE platform is aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition &amp; Sustainment OUSD (A&amp;S) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, "Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations," dated 17 November 2015. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) was designated as the DoD Acquisition Lead for the PCTE and the program is directed by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1645.  With the JROC validation of the Information System - Capability Development Document (IS-CDD) on 4 November 2019, the PCTE program quickly achieved Milestone B on 6 December 2019.

FY 2021 will focus on adding capability into the platform releases while updating to support increased automation, scalability, and usability. Planned updates include an Intel capability, enhanced After Action Review (AAR), and Platform Enterprise services to increase realism of the training environment. The planned updates also include automation to refine the build out of PCTE which decreases manual processes. The PCTE platform will obtain accreditation at the Top Secret (TS) level to serve the critical need of DoD Cyber Mission Force (CMF) users to train at the TS data classification level. Platform licensing will be scaled to support the full DoD CMF user base which has resulted in a shift in funding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Beginning FY 2021, OPA funds reprogrammed to Operations and Maintenance Army (OMA) (APE 151251000, MDEP VLWA) for software licensing for cyber training applications. PCTE has procured and installed the appropriate hardware infrastructure footprint to enable the platform to serve the Cyber Mission Force user base.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) program will employ an incremental acquisition strategy. The current strategy leverages the use of existing cyber contracts and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) vehicles to provide specified capabilities that will be integrated into a cohesive training platform. The next step in the acquisition strategy is developing a long term contract vehicle that will continue enabling the PCTE platform to achieve scalability, optimization, innovation, and quality standards to meet the dynamic needs of the Cyber Mission Force (CMF) user base. The PM is in the process of awarding a Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to serve PCTE as well as other cyber community customers called the Cyber Training, Readiness, Integration, Delivery, and Enterprise Technology (TRIDENT) contract in Q2FY2021. CYBER TRIDENT enables PCTE to provide iterative capability provided to the Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) in Capability Drops (CDs) that either improve or add features. These CDs will be based on requirements contained and further developed as part of the PCTE Information System - Capability Development Document (IS-CDD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) provides Army ground maneuver forces access to assured PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT Global Positioning System (GPS) may be limited or denied (jammed and spoofed). A-PNT products are ruggedized tactical systems that enable Army forces at echelon the ability to shoot, move, communicate, and protect their forces to penetrate and dis-integrate enemy anti-access systems, thereby allowing them to maneuver from operational and strategic distances to close with, destroy, and exploit the enemy in close and deep maneuver areas with sufficient combat bower, tempo, and momentum. A-PNT addresses two critical capability gaps: Access and Integrity. Access is the ability to retrieve accurate PNT information in a contested Electronic Warfare/Cyber environment. Integrity is the ability to trust the PNT information. PNT is a critical enabler of many Army Maneuver, Fires, and Command and Control systems that are dependent on accurate Position and Timing, and a foundational Multi-Domain Battle capability to support: calibrated force posture (position and maneuver across strategic distances); multi-domain formations (operate in contested spaces against near-peer adversaries); convergence (continuous integration of capabilities in all domains). The current Global Positioning System (GPS) capability is a fixed frequency system susceptible to electronic warfare and field environments (e.g. urban, dense vegetation).

Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated 05 April 2010, approved the PNT Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. Army Futures Command approved the Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS) Directed Requirement (DR) on 13 January 2019. The Dismounted A-PNT System (DAPS) Directed Requirement was approved 05 April 2019. The Alternative Navigation (ALTNAV) Directed Requirement was approved in November 2019. MAPS transitions to a Capability Development Document (CDD) in June 2020 and DAPS transitions in FY 2021.

Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) consists of:
(FJ8) - The Assured PNT project funding line is for: PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing to validate performance of end-to-end system performance; Resiliency and Software Assurance Measures (RSAM) upgrades to legacy GPS systems.  In addition, this line supports the development of complementary and adjacent A-PNT technologies as well as Enterprise Enablers including the Alternative Navigation (ALT NAV) signal Enterprise Build-out.  These technologies will be integrated into future products, strategies, concepts of operation, architectures, and platforms to assure PNT.

(FJ9) - Dismounted Assured PNT (A-PNT) System (DAPS) will provide the Soldiers equipped with Nett Warrior and other Soldier architecture compliant systems (e.g.Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS)) conducting operations outside of vehicles, unhindered access the critical timing and position data to effectively engage targets, share data across the network and conduct mission command functions.

(FK1)  - The Pseudolite project was terminated by the Army on 12 February 2019. 

(FK2) - The Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) System (MAPS) is a platform-mounted, ruggedized tactical PNT system which provides electronic protection capabilities that enable combatant commanders the ability to move, shoot, and communicate in a Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or denied environments.

(FK3) - The Anti-Jam Antenna Systems (AJAS) provides GPS signal point protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through Anti-Jam technologies. AJAS enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments. The AJAS will assist in delivering distributed assured PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner that allows for future modernization.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Dismounted Assured PNT (A-PNT) System (DAPS) implements congressional and OSD guidance to develop and field Military Code (M-Code) Ground User Equipment  (MGUE) receivers and provides the Soldiers equipped with Nett Warrior (NW) and other Soldier architecture compliant systems (e.g. Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS)) the critical timing and position data to effectively engage targets, share data across the network, and conduct mission command functions. DAPS is planned to be a size, weight and power (SWaP) optimized form-factor that paces the threats and includes development and integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and non-GPS sensors. DAPS integrates with the NW system and other Soldier architecture compliant systems, and distributes PNT information to the End-User Device (EUD). DAPS includes receiver software capable of fusing sensors and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals resulting in additional integrity for military GPS in denied environments and includes a M-Code receiver solution, or a Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) system with growth path to M-Code.

Through an iterative approach, DAPS will continue to fuse M-Code, GNSS, and non-GPS sensors, as well as fuse Alternate Navigation (ALTNAV) and other complementary PNT sources in a SWaP constrained system in order to pace/overmatch the threat and continue to deliver critical timing and position data to effectively
engage targets, share data across the network, and conduct mission command functions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Dismounted A-PNT program will provide the Soldier conducting operations outside of vehicles the means to maintain accurate position, velocity, and time information in Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or degraded/denied environments where space based PNT may be limited or denied. The Dismounted A-PNT capability will provide improved performance over the currently fielded Defense Advanced GPS Receiver.

The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps. Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units. This will be implemented by utilizing Other Transaction Authority (OTA)'s to competitively obtain prototypes. The Government will conduct laboratory and performance testing. The findings from these efforts will provide technology viability and allow for the transition to limited production. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing System (MAPS) will provide the Army's ground maneuver forces access to assured PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT Global Positioning System (GPS) may be limited or denied. A-PNT products are ruggedized tactical systems which provides electronic protection capabilities that enable combatant commanders the ability to move, shoot, and communicate in a Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or denied environments. MAPS addresses two critical capability gaps: Access and Integrity. Access is the ability to retrieve accurate PNT information in a contested Electronic Warfare/Cyber environment. Integrity is the ability to trust the PNT data. PNT is a critical enabler of many Army Maneuver, Fire and Command and Control systems that are dependent on accurate Position and Timing.

Mounted Hub A-PNT: The Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) System (MAPS) is a platform-mounted, ruggedized tactical PNT system which provides electronic protection capabilities that enable combatant commanders the ability to move, shoot, and communicate in a Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or denied environments. Included in the MAPS is the Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) which provides GPS signal point protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through Anti-Jam technologies. AJAS enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments. The AJAS will assist in delivering distributed assured PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner that allows for future modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Three vendors were selected and delivered 51 prototypes in 90 days to support testing, integration, and upward invitation.  Through the OTA, MAPS successfully integrated M-code, demonstrated anti-spoof technology, executed client system integration, and proved out other non-GPS PNT capabilities such as wheel speed sensors, inertials, timing augmentation.  MAPS also integrated GEN I onto four Stryker variants (62 total Strykers) in support of the USEURA Operational Needs Statement.  MAPS opened the PNT Systems Integration Lab (SIL) to enable rapid prototyping for the GEN II OTA and future PNT systems.</r2:Text>

The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps.  Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units.  This will be implemented by utilizing a competitive Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to obtain prototypes.  The Government will conduct Electromagnetic Interference and Environmental Testing, as well as performance testing in the System Integration Lab (SIL), anechoic chamber testing and a Military Feasibility Assessment (MFA).  The findings from these tests and assessment efforts will determine whether or not to begin platform integration. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) provides point protection by steering electronic nulls at interference sources or beams at valid signal sources. This enables continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) signal acquisition and tracking in a navigation warfare (jamming) environment. The AJAS is tightly coupled with the Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing System (MAPS) to provide GPS signal protection and assured PNT in challenged environments on Army tactical and combat vehicles.  The AJAS integration with the MAPS will achieve performance requirements in the highest threat level conditions.  These two products each provide a degree of A-PNT protection.  Integrated together, however, these two products will close the capability gap and achieve the desired performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The goal of the Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) program is to deliver distributed A-PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner that allows for future modernization. The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps. Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units. This will be implemented by utilizing a competitive Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to obtain prototypes.  The Government will conduct partial Electromagnetic Interference and Environmental Testing, as well as performance testing in the System Integration Lab (SIL), anechoic chamber testing and a Military Feasibility Assessment. The findings from these test and assessment efforts will determine whether or not to proceed to platform integration. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds space systems integration efforts performed by the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare (PEO IEW&amp;S) to develop and field space superiority capabilities.

Project FE5: Funds USASMDC/ARSTRAT to integrate warfighting concepts and technologies, validate concepts, and identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop DOTMLPF solutions to realize those space and high altitude related capabilities. Provide engineering support to the Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) Mission Management Center (MMC) through an associated test-bed for both operational and developmental injection and integration of real- time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture (COP) for Combatant Commanders (CCMDs), Joint Task Forces (JTFs), and Coalition Partners. The MMC injects real-time J-FFT information into the COP for CCMDs, JTFs and Coalition partners. USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DoD. CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight Force Modernization tasks to USSTRATCOM. USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for Friendly Force Tracking (FFT).

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY2020 FWC direct funding ($14.62M) supports the assured position, navigation and timing cross functional team (APNT CFT) Low Earth Orbit tactical space layer strategy ($58.776M); capability development support to the assured APNT CFT efforts to develop PNT situational awareness, develop alternative PNT sources and deny adversary use of PNT ($20.0M); and, TF EAGLE's execution of Consolidated SATCOM System Expert (CSS-E) System Tool ($11.6M).  The overall FWC decrease is a function of balancing between the FWC and APNT CFT funding for FY2020.  Once Project FE5 funding transfers to Project 990 in FY2021 (see separate 990 R-Form), FWC is expected to realize an increase of $2.789M for the APNT bridging effort plus fact-of-life inflationary adjustments.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Friendly Force Data Integration and Management (FFDIM) Capability Definition Package (CDP), a Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirements document (October 2017) validated the Joint Friendly Force Tracking (JFFT) Testbed's development, testing and integration capabilities and Friendly Force Tracking (FFT) System Expert support provided by U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) as U.S. Strategic Command's (USSTRATCOM's) Army Service Component Command (ASCC). In addition, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3910 (FFT Operations Guidance) directs USSTRATCOM's ASCC to execute eight specified FFT mission support responsibilities that include providing a testing and development capability to support joint, interagency and coalition partners FFT operations. USASMDC/ARSTRAT: Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for space, the Army integrator for global missile defense (GMD), and the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) of the USSTRATCOM. Army Regulation (AR) 10-87, Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007, and AR 5-22, The Army Force Modernization Proponent System, dated 19 August 2009, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Space/High Altitude capabilities. As the Army proponent for space and high altitude, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions.

Project FE5 funds USASMDC/ARSTRAT efforts to develop, analyze and mature warfighting concepts, and conduct warfighting experiments for space and high altitude capabilities. USASMDC/ARSTRAT is the proponent for space/high altitude capabilities and is responsible for determining and integrating DOTMLPF-P for the Army.
The program also funds development and integration of new data sources and services into the JFFT Mission Management Center (MMC), providing users FFT information system services at the highest Mission Assurance Category level (MAC 1). Software products developed and deployed by the JFFT Testbed into the MMC enable the receipt, integration and dissemination of real-time FFT information to the Common Operating Picture (COP) displays for Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Forces and coalition partners. JFFT Subject Matter Expert support to critical FFT interoperability assessments and development activities with coalition partners are supporting DOD's priority of strong alliances and partnerships. Integrated FFT data solutions developed by JFFT Testbed enable FFT data for COP display and Situational Awareness between Army forces and Unified Action Partners. The JFFT Testbed will continues to leverage FFT systems expertise and reduce Department of Defense costs by supporting numerous efforts, including the joint Personnel Recovery community response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement to resolve critical issues in isolated persons reporting and locating.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>- Developed for the Force Design Update (FDU) of the FBM Radar Battery that captures the full requirement of Mobile Electric Power (MEP) 810 generator mechanics. Result: This FDU is the result of the application of the full Manpower Requirements Criteria (MARC) to the FBM Battery TOE and is based upon the first transfer of power generation maintenance tasks that have been performed by contractors (CME) to military personnel and the partial application of MARC being performed by the 249th EN BN.  Changes to the FBM Battery are primarily driven by the application of the full Manpower Requirements Criteria (MARC) to the workload placed upon the Power Generation Section which drives a requirement of 20 soldiers per FBM Battery (20 x 5=100). Impact: Power generation at the five FBM Batteries is critical to the operation of the AN/TPY-2 radars and the life support areas at each location. USASMDC is completing efforts to convert critical power generation for its five remote FBM Radar sites from contractor to military performance.  This conversion is in line with a previous VCSA decision on 24 Jan 2013 to implement the conversion.  This conversation eliminates extreme high risk associated with contracted power generation support to the five FBM Radar Batteries and standardizes levels of support for all FBM sites are ready to address the challenges of an MDO.
- Provided Force Development counsel to SMD CoE leadership in order to engagement and influence the CCoE?s review of the 53rd?s requirements , providing command advocacy for satellite control capabilities for the 53rd Signal BN and to submit an FDU tied to LSCO gap #15. Provided inputs into the 53rd Signal BN FDU and the standup of the SMDC SATOPS BDE.  The SATSOPs BDE centralized SATCOM operations and management under a single command organization. RESULT: Injected requirements for growth of 53rd Signal BN capabilities in intelligence, logistics and satellite monitoring and mission command into Signal End to End (SE2E) briefings for senior Army leaders.  Provided instructional force development guidance on the organizational concept for SMDC SATOPS BDE for a command plan submission. IMPACT: 53rd Signal BN equities were briefed to CSA resulting in initiation of a force design update (FDU) by the Cyber Center of Excellence to mitigate documented capability shortfalls in mission command and monitoring of the global military wideband satellite constellation associated with LSCO Gap 15, EAB Network Operations and the Army now has a SATOPs BDE that can integrate SATCOM, SATCON and SATOPs for the Army.

Developed the analysis, Courses of Action (COAs) and recommendations to SMD CoE leaders and ASL on the future of Army Space Forces to support a Multi-Domain Force (MDO).  RESULT:  My team?s analysis will provided Army leaders with multiple COAs to consider the best way forward to distribute space control (SC) force structure and capabilities across the Army prior to the establishment of Army MDO force package #1. IMPACT:  The COAs will provide ASL multiple options to ?buy? Space forces.  The COAs provide no force structure options and options with force structure bills to ensure leaders can weigh the risk to operational impact of investing in Space capabilities.  Properly aligned SRC40 structure across the force will help the Army address LSCO gaps and set the way forward for in a MDO.  

- Developed the 1st Space Brigade Force Design Update (FDU) Jr. for submission and approval by Army Futures Command and HQDA.  RESULT:  This FDU Jr. redesigned the 1st Space BDE by redistributing the SSAPTs/TSSAPTs from the BDE HQ and reinvesting them in the 1st Space BN to create Space Control Planning Teams (SCPT).  Additionally it realigned force structure in the 1st Space BN to create Space Control Companies (SCC). These new force designs were derived from Space BDE lessons learned on the use of ARSST in today?s operating force and lesson learned from the ICEWS Space Company exercises.  IMPACT: The 1st Space BDE lacked capacity in space control to meet the demands identified in LSCO and MDO.  The realignment of personnel from the SSAPTs/TSSAPTs and SCCs will ensure the Army can address LSCO gaps, Space formation can survive in a MDO operating environment, and attack a threat force?s Space avenue of approach.  SCPTs and SCCs will disrupt/negate threat Space based capabilities.  SCPTs and SCCs will ensure threat commanders will be desynced and disaggregated in their MDO.  This FDU significantly increases the Army?s Space Control capability while simultaneously presenting no force structure bill to the Army.</r2:Text>

            <proc:Description>FY19 funding totals include $9.680M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

FY20 funding totals include $1.276M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

Passenger Carrying Vehicles includes the procurement of sedans, law enforcement sedans, ambulances and buses.  These vehicles are general in nature, but they fulfill unique and distinct needs commensurate with their design.

Sedans are available in compact, mid-size, and large, and are used to support a variety of functions and missions at all levels of the Air Force.  A portion of these sedans is dedicated for use by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and a portion is procured as chase cars used to support U-2 aircraft operations.

Law Enforcement Sedans (LE Sedans) come equipped with a heavy-duty component package for law enforcement and security missions.  Security forces personnel use this type of vehicle for emergency response, traffic control, patrol duties, and base security operations.

Ambulances include both bus ambulances and modular ambulances that are used for medical evacuation operations.   The bus ambulance is a 44 passenger bus converted to accommodate massive patient transport for medical emergency situations and humanitarian/disaster relief operations.  The modular models are standard commercial ambulances that are available in 4x2 and 4x4 configurations.  They are used for the movement of patients under field conditions, aircraft crash rescue operations, and routine transportation of patients to and from medical facilities.

Buses include a variety of commercial vehicles that support a broad range of mass transit requirements.  Bus sizes range from the 16 passenger shuttle bus to the 52 passenger bus.  These vehicles support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) training units, Air Force band organizations, protocol offices, and several other missions.

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PEs: 0202834F, 0207597F, 0305202F, 0507831F, 0502831F, 0702831F, 0305155F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $9.016M will procure, but not be limited to, 65 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.  

FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $1.302M will procure, but not be limited to, 12 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.       
   
Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.   
 
Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year.  

Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

The Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) contains a broad class of military specification vehicles with the capability to operate in austere and adverse terrain. They include, but are not limited to, Cargo Trucks, Wreckers, Dump Trucks, Tractors, Mobilizers, and Medium Tactical Trailers. They provide a range of capabilities such as line haul, mobility, resupply, maintenance, recovery, construction and civil engineering support.  They can be ordered with armor and winch systems. These tactical vehicles are used by Combat Communication Units, Air Support Operation Squadrons (ASOS), Explosive Ordinance Disposal units (EOD), and other direct mission support units throughout the Air Force.   

M1297 Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) 1.1: The GMV is a fast, lightweight, and highly mobile all-terrain combat vehicle developed to fill a ground mobility capability gap that was identified by SOCOM. The GMV is capable of being transported in the CH-47, CV-22 and C-130 aircraft and is low-velocity airdrop capable. The GMV can carry up to nine personnel. It is capable of being "guns up in under a minute after exiting the aircraft, and can carry a variety of armaments. Its adaptable communications suite provides increased operating range and provides the operator real-time access to critical information. The advanced lightweight chassis and suspension allows the GMV to negotiate severe terrain at high speeds, maintain stability and performance while carrying a maximum payload. The main weapon turret allows for 360 degrees of firepower protection up to a 30mm cannon. Door mounted arm-swings can be mounted to handle smaller caliber secondary crew-served weapons. This vehicle is primarily used by Air Force Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) and Special Operations forces. 

Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV): The ISV provides mobility for a 9-person squad with associated equipment to move around the close battle area.  The ISV is a lightweight, high mobility platform that is transportable by all means including vertical lift and Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD).  The ISV adds a needed capability to Airmen for mobility to support dispersed wide area security, increased speed, extended reach, burden reduction, carrying enablers, battery charging, mission command enhancement, and offers the commander new maneuver options.  This vehicle is primarily used by Special Operations Forces, Tactical Air Control Party, and Security Forces.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for the exhibit contained in PEs 0202834F, 0507831F, 0502831F, 0702831F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $15.058M will procure, but not be limited to, 104 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.  

FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $3.4M will procure, but not be limited to, 13 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.  

Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.    

Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year.  

Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a Congressionally chartered non-profit corporation that serves as the Auxiliary of the Air Force.  CAP uses federally provided resources to provide assistance requested by the DoD, federal, state or local government authorities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to perform emergency or non-emergency public purpose missions and activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Pursuant to US Code (Title 10 &amp; 36) the purpose of CAP Corporation is to encourage and aid citizens of the US in contributing their efforts, services, and resources in developing aviation and in maintaining air supremacy; and to encourage and develop, by example, the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.                                                                                               

Vehicle procurements enable the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) to provide rapid deployment of emergency essential ground teams who are capable of providing critical communications and humanitarian support during national emergencies and disasters.                                                                                               

CAP's procurement processes/standards are described in Department of Defense Grant &amp; Agreement Regulations.                                                                                                            

Program element associated with this P-1 Line is: 0901223F</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 funding procures, but is not limited to, vehicles,  Cadet and Aerospace Education programs that encourage and develop the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.

Vehicle type and quantities may change in execution year due to market availability, cost changes, mission requirements, additional funding, and needs of the organization.  CAP generally receives a mark-up in execution year funds from Congress.

CAP provides critical communication and transportation for ground teams who support 90% of the Air Force's search and rescue (SAR) missions in accordance with the National SAR Plan and disaster relief activities.  Vehicles also provide transportation for over 24,000 CAP cadets to support execution of the Aerospace Education and Cadet Program missions as directed by 36 U.S.C Section 403, 10 U.S.C. Section 9442.

FY20 funding totals include $9.702M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

This vehicle group consists of pickup trucks, trailers, semi-trailers, trucks, vans, utility trucks, maintenance and facility vehicles essential to base and flying operations.  Assets are critical to the Air Force mission and are essential to flight line operations (aircraft maintenance), depot maintenance, component routing to depot back shops and airfield maintenance, and Air Base Civil Engineers performing base housing maintenance and repairs.  These items are critical across the spectrum of functional users throughout the Air Force and provide multi-purpose capabilities.  These vehicles also support mission needs for light to heavy cargo transport, as well as transportation for air/flight crew personnel.  Cargo utility vehicles also provide heavy cargo movement for civil engineering and construction projects.  Without the procurement of these replacement vehicles, the Air Force will not have  the ability to support broad spectrum Air Force operations.

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $38.920M will procure, but not be limited to, 987 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel. 
            
FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $12.475M will procure, but not be limited to, 262 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel. 
              
Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.   
 
Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year.  

Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY19 funding totals include $17.482M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

FY20 funding totals include $40.999M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Family of Vehicles (FoV) has been chosen by the Department of Defense (DOD) as the multi-service (USMC, Army, Navy, and Air Force) tactical vehicle replacement for the HMMWV. The Army has been assigned lead service responsibilities for the JLTV and has established the Army Joint Program Office (JPO). All JLTVs must be acquired through the Army JPO contract. The JLTV provides major operational improvements in Force Protection (FP), payload, mobility, fuel efficiency and reliability, along with the growth potential to meet future mission requirements. The JLTV also has a companion trailer that is available with the vehicle to replace the HMMWV trailer (M1101/M1102).

The USAF investment in JLTVs began in FY17 and FY18 under 823230 - Security and Tactical Vehicles.  Starting in FY19 and throughout the FYDP, JLTVs will be procured under BPAC 823210.  Currently the USAF plans on purchasing 2,093 JLTVs. The USAF JLTVs span three different vehicle variants consisting of 26 different mission configurations and a JLTV trailer. Some mission configurations already exist and others are currently being developed through Work Directives generated and worked through the JPO.      

General Purpose (GP) JLTV - The GP JLTV is the base vehicle that carries a 4 man-crew with a payload of 3,500 lbs. Users: ACC, AFMC, AMC, PACAF, USAFE

Utility (UT) JLTV - The Utility JLTV carries a 2 man crew for cargo delivery or shelter carrier.  It supports a payload of 5,100 lbs.  Users: ACC, AFMC, AMC, PACAF

Heavy Guns Carrier (HGC) JLTV - The HGC JLTV carries a 4 man-crew and a Gunner in Turret or Remote Weapon System (RWS). It supports crew served weapons (M-2 or MK-19) with Gunner's Protection Kit or RWS.  Users: AETC, AFCENT, AFGSC, AFSPC, AMC, PACAF, USAFE

JLTV Trailer - The JLTV Trailer is capable of meeting similar mobility characteristics to the prime mover and is capable of safely carrying payload of 5500 lbs.  Users: EOD

Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) Kits: These are options that come fully installed and integrated into the vehicle during production. CFE kits include, but are not limited to, Armor kits, intercom kit, run flat tires, combat bumpers, and explosively formed projectile protection kits.

Government Furnished Equipment (GFE): There are two types of GFE related to the JLTV, Expansion Kits and Overhead Equipment.

- Expansion Kits: These kits are installed during vehicle production and provide all necessary cabling (power, signal, RF), connectors, and hardware to enable installation of Mission Specific Equipment above and beyond the Contractor furnished Base Vehicle Platform Infrastructure and Baseline Integration Kits. These expansion kits include, but are not limited to, VRC radio kits, CREW-CVRJ kits, DVE kits, and shot detection kits.

- Overhead Equipment:  Currently, the only Overhead GFE installed during production is the M1114 Turret Ring and Hatch. The M1114 Ring and Hatch will apply to all HGC JLTV configurations. 

Field Service Representative (FSR) Support: OEM and/or contractor FSR support is required to provide de-processing (acceptance inspections) and Operator and Maintainer Training when the vehicles are delivered to the user locations. FSRs will may install any Mission Specific Equipment and additional overhead GFE as required by the user. 

Work Directives: Studies and engineering tasks are performed by the Army Joint Program Office or OEM engineers to ensure compatibility and operability on any new AF specific requirements that will be added to the JLTV based on user requirements.  Work Directives will also be required for any repairs prior to JPO long term repair and maintenance contracts are awarded.

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $30.544M will procure, but not be limited to, 86 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel. 

FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $26.150M will procure, but not be limited to, 56 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.        
      
Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.  
  
Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities and user expansion kit requirements provided by each user community based on mission requirements.   Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY19 funding totals include $0.130M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

Funding provides for a variety of security and tactical vehicles essential to strategic military operations.  This program previously procured the standard diesel powered High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and all configurations used by the Air Force, Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle (GAARV), and cargo trailers.  Services are no longer procuring HMMWVs as they are being replaced with the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (BPAC 823210). Instead funding will be used to procure next generation security and tactical vehicles to include the fielding of the Joint All-weather All-Terrain Support Vehicles (JAASV) and Commercial Armored Tactical Vehicle (CATV).

M1101 and M1102 light tactical trailers: The M1101 and M1102 are a single axle, two wheel trailer designed to be towed by a HMMWV.  The trailers have the same tires, wheels, and track width as the HMMWV.  The only difference between the M1101 and the M1102 trailer is the model information and payload capacity.  The trailers have various applications and provide the forces with a light, nimble, rugged trailer built primarily for hauling cargo. 

Joint All-weather All-Terrain Support Vehicles (JAASV) operates in "otherwise impassable terrain such as marshy conditions, deep snow, lakes, rivers, frozen ice and extreme cold weather as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. As a tracked, amphibious platform, it will have a light footprint and be transportable by a CH-47, UH-60 or C-130.

Commercial Armored Tactical Vehicle (CATV) is an armored vehicle on a ruggedized off-road platform which allows for customized seating and equipment storage options with a heavy duty upgraded suspension.  The increased ground clearance and robust suspension allows for emergency response in rural regions and natural disaster scenarios.  The rotating roof hatch and optional Gunner Protection Kit can accommodate weapons mounts for an M249, Mk19, M2 .50 Cal and additional weapons as necessary.  The primary user is Global Strike Command.

Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle: The Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle (GAARV) is an air-deployable surface recovery platform capable of maneuvering over adverse terrain in order to search for and recover isolated personnel and/or equipment.  It will provide increased survivability during "outside the wire" personnel recovery operations, more secure transportation capability to the recovery team and injured/isolated personnel from an area of high threat, and necessary training platforms for operators to familiarize themselves with vehicles they utilize in the area of operations.  It also provides operators with increased protection from enemy fire and improvised explosive devices. Funding includes, but is not limited to procurement of end items, training, upgrades, spares, Interim Contractor Support (ICS), repairs, deployment packages and returns.  This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements. On 7 July 2017, ACC/A5/8R terminated the HDT Storm solution to the GAARV requirement. A new solution to the requirement will be developed if/when the GAARV requirement is revalidated. Subsequent funding will fund contract termination and Program Management Administration until a follow-on requirement is identified. Funding for GAARV is in Program Element 0207227F.

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.
  
In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PEs 0202834F,  0207227F, 0507831F, 0502831F, 0702831F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $0.319M will procure, but not be limited to, 9 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.           

Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.    

Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year.  

Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

The Special Purpose Vehicles group consists of various vehicles for flightline, maintenance, and facility operations used for a variety of purposes.  Examples of these vehicles include the IW 40 tractor, an assortment of wreckers and refuse trucks, potable and non-potable water distribution trucks, refueling vehicles, deicers, staircase trucks, lavatory service trucks, high reach maintenance trucks, glycol recovery vehicles, disabled patient vehicles, and tow tractors. Tow tractors are used to tow aircrafts, munition trailers, and ground support equipment.  The IW 40 tractor is a small farm tractor used primarily to pull a mower and for other light tasks; the wreckers are used to move disabled vehicles, haul vehicles or to deploy a heavy duty winch.  The refuse trucks in this group include one which tilts and dumps a payload and one which compacts refuse prior to discharge. Aircraft refueling vehicles refuel and defuel aircrafts. Potable water distribution trucks provide drinking water to personnel; non-potable water distribution trucks are used primarily to wet down and control dust at a construction site. 

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PEs 0207142F, 0202834F, 0207597F, 0401319F, 0507831F, 0502831F, 0702831F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $43.157M will procure, but not be limited to, 264 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $51.254M will procure, but not be limited to, 260 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.    

Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year.  

Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

FY20 funding totals include $16.652M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

This P-1 line procures a variety of critical fire fighting and crash rescue vehicles.  Vehicles typically include, but are not limited to, the following:

-- The P-19 Crash Truck is an Air Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicle that is a first response vehicle on the scene of an aircraft fire emergency.  It equips bases with the capability to rapidly extinguish aircraft fires.  This truck is a mandatory flight line operations safety requirement and is essential at bases with a flying mission. The P-19 also provides fire fighting capability for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve installations located at municipal airports.  An installation's P-19 requirement is determined by the type of aircraft frequenting the aerial facility and the resulting gallons per minute of fire fighting agent required.  This vehicle provides aircrew, passenger, weapons, and airframe fire protection at a crash site.

-- The P-21 Aerial Lift Truck is a fire fighting vehicle with a 105 foot aerial ladder.  It provides improved agent delivery over older model vehicles, as well as the capability to provide elevated delivery of agent involving high rise buildings and warehouse facilities.

-- The P-22 4x2 and P-24 4x4 Pumper Trucks are designed primarily to fight structural fires.  The trucks have a 750-gallon water tank and a 50-gallon Aqueous FilmFoam class "A" foam tank and are capable of applying 1250 gallons per minute. P-24 is built on a rugged 4x4 chassis that equips forces with limited off-road/rugged terrain capability.  The P-22 4x2 Pumper Truck has the same fire fighting capability as the P-24, but is used in urban areas.

-- The P-23 Crash Truck is a larger version of the P-19 ARFF truck and has a larger fire suppression capacity.  It is primarily assigned at transport, bomber, depot, and cargo aircraft bases.

-- The P-26 Water Tanker Truck is a 4000-gallon resupply truck used to support the ARFF vehicles, fight wild land fires, and provide mutual assistance to communities. 

-- The P-29 Wild Land Firefighting Truck is a four-person crew cab truck which contains a modular agent and pump and roll delivery system as well as firefighting tools and equipment.  This truck is outfitted with a Compressed Air Foam System (CAFS) and has a 500 gallon water tank.  The truck is intended to combat wild land and brush type fires.

-- The P-30 is a Medium Rescue Vehicle.  It is designed to bring equipment, lighting, a winch, and a generator to the scene of a rescue event.  This vehicle has 450 cubic feet of storage space and affords easy equipment access and improved storage compartments.  This truck is assigned to the larger industrial bases.

-- The P-31 Hazardous Material Vehicle is a dual purpose vehicle that stows and transports hazardous material response equipment for the purpose of mitigating chemical leaks, spills, and releases.  This vehicle also provides an incident command workstation area for the purpose of research, command, control, and communications during containment/cleanup operations. 

-- The P-33 Quint Truck is a fire fighting truck with a 75 foot aerial ladder.  It provides improved agent delivery over older models as well as the capability to provide elevated delivery  of agent involving high rise and warehouse facilities.  

-- The P-34 is a first response Air Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicle which equips forces with initial "knock down" capability.  The P-34 is the first fire truck to employ Ultra High Pressure (UHP) technology which allows the vehicle to discharge a mixture of water and foam at 1350 psi.  This UHP technology makes the vehicle three times more effective than a conventional ARFF truck.  The truck has a 400 gallon water tank and a 50 gallon foam tank along with a bumper turret and 200 feet of hand line all mounted on an F-550 chassis.

-- The Rapid Intervention Vehicle (RIV) is a first response aircraft fire truck; it is the newest addition to the Air Force's fleet of crash response vehicles.  The RIV is the first vehicle in the AF to use new Ultra High Pressure (UHP) fire fighting technology which makes this truck 3 to 3.5 times more efficient at knock-down than conventional ARFF vehicles.  This feature increases the length of time the vehicle can remain on the scene without having to be resupplied.  Perched on an F550 chassis, the RIV is equipped with  a 4-wheel drive train; it provides seating for four, equips fire fighters with limited storage for rescue equipment; has a bumper turret, a 200 ft hand line and a winch.  Because of its size, speed and agility this truck can get to a crash scene quickly and perform fire fighting operations until the larger trucks can arrive at the scene.   

These vehicles are all built to meet the performance standards of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Air Force safety regulations. 

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0202834F, 0702831, 0901279F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $8.621M will procure, but not be limited to, 16 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.     

FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $24.903M will procure, but not be limited to, 40 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.    

Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year.
  
Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY19 funding totals include $24.680M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

FY20 funding totals include $2.944M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

This program includes various material handling vehicles with an individual item procurement value of less than $5M.  These vehicles consist of Forklifts, Container Handlers, Locomotive, Baggage Conveyors, Warehouse Tugs and Warehouse Cranes critical to Depot and Base Supply Operations. 

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for these exhibits contained in PEs: 0202834F, 0207142F, 0207597F, 0208028F, 0507831F, 0702831F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $12.897M will procure, but not be limited to, 101 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $14.167M will procure, but not be limited to, 35 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.    

Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year.  

Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY19 funding totals include $9.680M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

FY20 funding totals include $3.753M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

This program procures snow removal vehicles and commercial sweepers used on all airfield surfaces to remove snow and help prevent foreign object damage (FOD) to aircraft engines and tires.  Snow removal equipment includes front mounted brooms, multi-purpose blowers, and plows.  These vehicles provide critical mission support to airfield operations because fighter aircraft cannot land or take off with ice on the runway.  Multi-purpose vacuum sweepers maintain airfields, roads, and grounds.  Vacuum sweepers provide equally important support at all air bases due to the high cost of FOD and the potential for loss in FOD-related engine accidents.

These assets are critical to the Air Force mission.  They are the primary equipment used for snow, ice, and debris removal from runways and taxiways year round.  The vital functions of these vehicles prevent the closing of airfields due to debris and/or snow and ice buildup. 

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PEs: 0202834F, 0208028F, 0502831F, 0507831F, 0702831F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $3.577M will procure, but not be limited to, 22 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $5.759M will procure, but not be limited to, 21 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.    

Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year. 
 
Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY19 funding totals include $9.680M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

FY20 funding totals include $11.837M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

This vehicle group consist of maintenance/test vans, water distribution trucks and heavy construction equipment (dozers, large cranes, large dump trucks, rock crushers, motorized scrapers, well-drilling vehicles, compactors, wheel loaders, graders, cement mixers, paving machines, excavators, sewer trucks, refuse trucks, trenches and backhoes).  The assets are critical to the Air Force mission and are crucial to keeping many sortie generation/sortie sustainment missions supported and operational.  The types of items contained in this P-1 line are critical (deployed) assets used in direct support of Air Force units engaged in contingency operations.

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PEs: 0202834F, 0208028F, 0502831F, 0507831F, 0702831F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement dollars in the amount of $43.095M will procure, but not be limited to, 220 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.      

FY21 OCO dollars in the amount of $20.653M will procure, but not be limited to, 126 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.  

Quantities are based on current requirements provided by the 441 Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) IAW the process outlined in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management.  The requirements are generated from the priority buy model that is used to support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.    

Quantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Regional Base Cluster Prepositioning Kits (RBCP) for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.

As the model applies the life expectancy/sustainment cost/mission priority logic in generating requirements, there can be gaps in individual vehicle type (NSN) requirements from year-to-year. 
 
Unit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities, CONUS/OCONUS locations, inflation and additional requirements (options required by users).  Examples of options include, but are not limited to, specialized trailer towing packages, export (non-Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) engines, and mission specific specialized attachments for construction vehicles.  Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing.</proc:Justification>

PE 0208087F DISTRIBUTED CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS (DCWO)
Provides for the support and deployment of cyberspace solutions in the form of material and non-material cyberspace network attack tools and exploits for DCWO portfolio to include but not limited to AF Offensive Cyberspace Operations (OCO) units, the Cyber Mission Forces, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and other authorized agencies. Funding procures specialized hardware/software necessary for real time deployment, exploit identification, tool development, and testing in an environment simulating real-world operational infrastructures and enclaves. Funding also is used for the procurement of the AF cyber test and training range, used for workforce training by the 318th Cyber Operations Group under the 67th Cyber Wing. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2021, procurement funding realigned to WSC 834320 C3 Countermeasures for clarity in reporting.


PE 0208088F AF DEFENSIVE CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS (DCO)
Provides defensive counter cyberspace capability that protects the AFNet and DoD network enclaves, to include their associated computer systems, software applications and sensitive operational information against unauthorized intrusion, corruption, and/or destruction. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2021 Other Procurement Funding realigned from WSC 831010 Comm Security Equipment (Comsec) and WSC 835080 AFNET to WSC 834320 C3 Countermeasures for clarity in reporting. 


PE 0303135F PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) 

PKI provides identity management (IDM) services as part of the DOD Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM) program to support warfighter requirements. Air Force IDM programs align with DoD ICAM efforts and support DoD ICAM Roadmap and Strategic Plan and the AF ICAM Technology Roadmap. PKI provides the fundamental framework implemented within DoD to ensure information system's security. It provides the capability to attach digital signatures to electronic documents for IDM, to encrypt and decrypt electronic documents for secure transmission, and to support physical and logical access control solutions.  PKI-enabled applications afford confidentiality and authentication services to communications and/or network transactions, as well as verification of the data integrity and non-repudiation of those transactions. PKI is one of many security solutions used to protect information and provide attributes enabling authorization access to critical resources in the Air Force Information Networks (AFIN) and used concurrently with other solutions. PE also includes Air Force Directory Service (AFDS), which is the single source of consolidated authoritative IDM enabling secure smart card logon to AF clients and applications.  AFDS ensures that AF user identities are common and synchronized across directories and information stores of various networks, systems, and applications. AFDS eliminates the disparity of maintaining stove-piped systems and using directory technology, alleviates latency associated with the sharing/replication of identity data attributes. AFDS supports delivery of an enterprise security service and backbone for AF networks, by providing AF user credentials to the AF Network Enterprise and AF system applications.  


PE 0303140F INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY PROGRAM (ISSP): 

This program funds procurement of Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment, ancillary encryption/decryption devices, and related equipment to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability and enable the secure transport of information.  ISSP delivers on rising national, DoD, and AF priorities to address cybersecurity threats and increasing warfighter dependence on cyberspace.  AF and DoD require the capability to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority, the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power in modern, high-tempo, full spectrum operations.  AF COMSEC equipment protects information such as, warfighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commander's orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness.  This COMSEC program ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information.  When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the warfighter, DoD military forces may suffer devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or exceptionally grave damage to national security.  The COMSEC program includes equipment upgrades and replacements which incorporate the best technologies mandated to provide mission critical warfighter secure voice and data communications in tactical, strategic, and network applications for our globally-deployed COMSEC crypto assets supporting both AF and DoD missions.  Details of the assets are included in each section's narrative.

Under Cryptographic Modernization 2 (CM2) effort - IFF Mode 5: Produce modified IFF cryptographic components. The permanent modification of these devices are required to address produce-ability and algorithm re-programmability mandated by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the 2019 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510

PE 0303135F PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI): 
 
1.  EVOLUTIONARY PKI END USER EQUIPMENT:  PKI provides identity management (IDM) services as part of the DOD Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM) program to support warfighter requirements. Air Force IDM programs align with DoD ICAM efforts and support DoD ICAM Roadmap and Strategic Plan and the AF ICAM Technology Roadmap.  PKI provides the fundamental framework and services implemented within DoD to ensure information systems security. It provides the capability to attach digital signatures to electronic documents for IDM, to encrypt and decrypt electronic documents for secure transmission, and to support physical and logical access control solutions.  PKl-enabled applications afford confidentiality and authentication services to communications and/or network transactions, as well as verification of the data integrity and non-repudiation of those transactions. PKI is one of many security solutions used to protect information and provide attributes enabling authorization access to critical resources in the Air Force Information Networks (AFIN) and is used concurrently with other solutions. FY21 funding supports several different requirement areas to procure infrastructure equipment for the field in support of AFIN, PKI, Evolutionary PKI End User Equipment to include multifactor authentication technologies and authorization services, Less Than Medium Assurance (LTMA) capabilities and services, cloud/mobile support, claims-based authorization, attribute-based access control, federation to support mission partners, and non-person entities management.  The current DoD PKI token (DoD Common Access Card (CAC)) is undergoing a gradual evolution towards a higher assurance token. Additionally, Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) mandates a common identification card across the Federal Government. Based on the HSPD-12 requirements, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) which adds security requirements to the identification card.

2.  AIR FORCE DIRECTORY SERVICES (AFDS):  AFDS is the single source of consolidated authoritative identity management data that enables secure smart card logon to Air Force clients and applications, facilitating global net-centric operations. As part of the DOD/AF Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM) section, AFDS capabilities include identity data directory (IDD), automated AFNET account provisioning and exchange contact information synchronization (ECIS) also known as GAL synchronization. AFDS ensures that AF user identities are common and synchronized across directories and information stores of various networks, systems, and applications. AFDS eliminates the disparity of maintaining stove-piped systems and using directory technology, alleviates latency associated with the sharing/replication of identity data attributes. AFDS supports delivery of an enterprise security service and backbone for AF networks (both in-garrison and tactical), by providing AF user credentials to the AF Network Enterprise and AF system applications. AFDS leverages and provides a core meta-directory service that "joins" and synchronizes personal identity data attributes from authoritative AF and DoD repositories for use by all AF systems and applications. Funds will support procurement of identity and credential solutions for mobile platforms and AF systems and applications to meet DoD and AF ICAM requirements as well as procure hardware, software and contractor supported upgrades. FY21 funds will procure hardware, software, and support upgrades.

PE 0303140F INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY PROGRAM:

1. AIR AND GROUND (A&amp;G) COMSEC PROGRAM:  The Air and Ground COMSEC Program procures and supports a wide range of secure encryption products supporting AF, inter-service, and various DoD agency customers; and includes items approved under the National Security Agency (NSA) Commercial COMSEC Evaluation Program (CCEP) such as KIV-7M, Tactical Fast Lane (TACLANE), and other High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) devices.  The program includes equipment upgrades and replacements that incorporate state-of-the-art technologies for mission-critical warfighter secure voice and data communications.  The program provides needed upgrades to encryption devices in FY21 to comply with NSA's Advanced Cryptographic Capabilities (ACC) directives.  The program supports tactical, strategic, and network applications for globally deployed cryptologic assets supporting AF and DoD.  Supported systems fall within AF Information Systems Security and Information Assurance arenas.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0303140F. 
  
      a. IN-LINE NETWORK ENCRYPTORS (INE):  Previously called Network Encryption Systems.  FY21 funding fields the new INE required to maintain the confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation of classified communications.  INEs are the mainstay for securing communications used in classified terrestrial and airborne communications networks.  The new INEs feature robust data encryption improvements included in the HAIPE Interoperability Specification (HAIPE IS) as well as Internet Protocol (IP) Version 6 capability that will improve security and expand the bandwidth of USAF secure IP networks.
 
      b. LINK ENCRYPTION FAMILY (LEF):  Provides for the replacement of the legacy LEF with new more secure crypto modernization compliant LEF devices.  The LEF provides near real-time secure communications for national and command level decision making authorities up to TOP SECRET SCI.  The new LEF devices include more robust encryption algorithms, as well as dual-channel, increased bandwidth capability, and reprogramability.  NSA has issued classified instructions regarding the use of specific LEF devices. No FY21 funding requested.
 
      c. AIR AND GROUND COMSEC CONSOLIDATED:  Several requirements have been combined into one line: Secure Telephones, COMSEC Acquisition Reform (CAR), Peculiar Support Equipment, Secure Communications Voice/Data, Embedded Encryption Devices, and Telemetry Encryption Devices.  FY21 funds procure secure voice/data equipment, latest generation Tier 3 devices (such as SKLs/NGLD-Ms/TKLs), DoD Type 1 COMSEC equipment and commercial cryptography products, testing and support equipment, embedded COMSEC modules, and telemetry devices and Link-16.  The Air and Ground COMSEC line is an aggregation of numerous items.  Each year the types and quantities of items utilized to meet requirements vary; an average unit cost is based on number/type of units planned for purchase.
 
2. CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION (CM):  The DoD is transforming its existing operational capabilities to realize a seamless Joint network of information and engagement grids that securely link sensors, command and control cells, and tactical units to support current and future warfighting capabilities.  This includes cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable--allowing more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, reduced costs, and ensured Global Information Grid (GIG) compatibility.  The GIG requires a transformed cryptographic inventory.  The DoD Cryptographic Modernization (CM) Initiative delivers that inventory, ensuring a strong security posture for national security and tactical communications systems by providing transparent cryptographic capabilities consistent with operational imperatives, NSA mandates, and mission environments.  The future inventory will provide security devices that ease logistics, support Joint and coalition interoperability, enable network-centric and transparent key/equipment management, and allow effective future upgrades.  These CM programs enable information dominance by developing and procuring communications security devices that deter and deny known and emerging threats, while accommodating significantly increased bandwidths and processing speeds, and without increasing communication transient and information holding risk.  Current CM programs will ensure modernized, secure communications capability to Vinson/ANDVT devices and miniaturized crypto for small unmanned systems.  Current programs will replace/upgrade over 30,000 devices out of the Air Force's 245,000+ crypto devices and provided over 100,000 new devices where none were previously available.  Other programs are undergoing development under the auspices of other lines in this PE in order to meet emerging COMSEC requirements for Key Management Infrastructure compatibility, as well as various enterprise-wide technological upgrades mandated under the NSA assessments and Policy #3-9 "Cryptographic Modernization Initiative Requirements for Type 1 Cryptographic Products".  Funding for this effort is in PE 0303140F. 
 
   a. IDENTIFICATION FRIEND OR FOE (IFF) MODE 5 CM:  This program developed and is procuring devices to encrypt/decrypt IFF Mode 4 and Mode 5 interrogator and transponder operations.  These devices, built to Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS), IFF, Mark XIIA, System (AIMS) 04-900 Cryptographic Interface Standard, are integrated into all airborne platforms and ground radar applications to provide critical, immediate tactical aircraft identification data to ground and airborne systems.  Procurement of the two primary devices, KIV-77 and KIV-78 are being assessed annually in coordination with ACC CYSS/CYZ AF Crypto requirements office for any platform requirement changes that drive procurement actions.
 
      (1) KIV-78 DEVICES:  No FY21 procurements are required.

      (2) KIV-77 DEVICES:  No FY21 procurements are required.
 
   b. VINSON/ANDVT CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION (VACM): FY21 funds support the VACM program.  VACM is an element within the AF CM Program. This program developed and is procuring devices designed to replace the legacy capability on VINSON/ANDVT secure voice communications on aircraft, ships, and ground fixed and mobile platforms including critical Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) and other Top Secret and Secret networks (Devices: KY-57/58, KY-99/100 and USC-43).  The VACM Embedded Project upgrades the Baseband Input/Output (BBIO) module as a permanent modification of the ARC-234. The VACM Remote Control Unit (RCU) project is a permanent sustainment modification effort that will augment and replace legacy RCU inventory.
 
       (1) VACM COMPONENTS (ARC-234):  FY21 funding supports the VACM Embedded Project. It was established to modernize cryptographic devices that are integrated within various VINSON/ANDVT radios.  The BBIO module performs COMSEC functions for the ARC-234.  The Permanent Sustainment Modification of the ARC-234 will retain Embedded COMSEC capability by upgrading the BBIO module with reprogrammable hardware and modern crypto algorithms.  The upgraded BBIOs will be installed/modified into the ARC-234 radios. 
  
       (2) VACM DEVICES:  FY21 funding procures modernized secure voice communication devices.  The production line will replace five legacy crypto device types on critical national leadership networks including airborne, ground and mobile platforms. 

       (3) Remote Control Unit (RCU): FY21 funding supports the RCU, a permanent sustainment modification project that will provide a form fit replacement and backward capability with legacy devices. This effort fixes existing sustainment challenges.
 
   c. MISSILE ELECTRONIC ENCRYPTION DEVICE (MEED):  FY21 funding will procure modified Missile Entry Control System (MECS) KL-90 devices used encrypt/decrypt personnel authentication and lock combination transmission to ensure only authorized personnel enter into Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) control centers and facilities.  This effort will field the MEED equipment in compliance with current NSA information assurance (IA) security design guidance.

   d. MINI CRYPTO (MC):  FY21 funding supports the MC program in the procurement of a Tactical Key Management (TKM) miniaturized cryptographic solution to protect Secret and Below (SaB) Command and Control (C2) and mission data for Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained small form factor platforms and unmanned systems/sensors--many of which currently have no cryptographic capability and transmit in the clear.  MC's Tactical Key Management (TKM) solution uses unclassified algorithms, can perform all aspects of key management, and can self-generate its own key.  This unique combination enables "lose-able" tactical crypto to protect lives and valuable assets, removing the requirement for pre-placed key material, reducing the logistical/operational burden on tactical users, while allowing the ability to add/remove users as the tactical situation dictates.
 
FY21 Plans:
(1) Complete Full Rate Production (FRP) option activities
(2) Provide remaining FRP units to MC Users
(3) Provide support to MC Users as they integrate MC into their platforms
(4) Prepare IDIQ follow-on contract in support of additional User MC quantity requirements

   e. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA):  FY21 program management administration funding supports management with engineering and technical expertise in support of procurement activities.

   f. REMOTE REKEY (RRK) (CI-33) DEVICES:  The RRK System requires technology insertion and security enhancement activities to meet DoD, NSA and AF security and sustainment mandates. The first requirement of this effort is an operating system update to the RRK workstation. This update from Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) 3.X (Microsoft Windows 7) to SDC 5.X (Microsoft Windows 10), will require further enhancements of the custom commercial software to identify with the new Win 10 operating system. The second element of this requirement is to eliminate the static link in the software to allow for compatibility with any version of a KG-175D, adding flexibility to host next generation Inline Network Encryptor. No FY21 funding requested.

3. AIR FORCE ELECTRONIC KEY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AF EKMS):  AF EKMS is now referenced as "Tier 3 devices" under the AIR AND GROUND (A&amp;G) COMSEC PROGRAM, in the AIR AND GROUND COMSEC CONSOLIDATED section.

4. AIR FORCE KEY MANAGEMENT ENTERPRISE (AF KME):  The DoD has directed replacement of the legacy Air Force Electronic Key Management System (AF EKMS) portion of the AF KME with the DoD KMI.  The AF KMI transition activity procures and deploys the DoD KMI equipment and software within the AF to provide mission critical COMSEC support for all AF mission and platforms implementing the core capability for the AF's future KME.  The AF KMI transition activity procures KMI connectivity, key management and cryptographic unique/certified products (Tier 2) to replace legacy AF EKMS equipment per NSA mandates and to field KMI-enabled products that have been under previous years DOD development.  Funding for this effort is in program element 0303140F.

            <proc:Description>International Intelligence Technology and Architectures oversees, manages, and provides the United States (US) component of the multi-national Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES) with a collaborative environment and intelligence sharing enterprise required for processing and disseminating critical intelligence information between and among US, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), allied and coalition forces. The US BICES program procures and maintains a standing intelligence information sharing capability across Department of Defense (DoD), Combat Support Agencies (CSA), and multiple Combatant Commands (CCMD) for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (OUSD(I)). At the request of OUSD(I), US BICES is extended beyond NATO nations into all CCMDs and is known as US BICES Extended (US BICES-X). US BICES provides an "enduring" US and Coalition interoperable intelligence sharing multi-level secure technical architecture utilizing releasable elements of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework and functions to support the full spectrum of intelligence operations and dissemination throughout the DoD community. Also, it enables instantiation of US BICES/BICES-X as the intelligence contribution to the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0305600F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In response to CCMD requirements, funding for US BICES/US BICES-X capabilities implements OUSD(I) global intelligence sharing arrangements. FY2021 funding procures hardware and software to support the expansion of the US BICES-X coalition information sharing capabilities for US Combatant Commanders to meet theater strategy worldwide.  Specifically funding will support J2 (Joint Intelligence) network requirements to exchange intelligence information with bi-lateral, multi-lateral, and NATO partners. BICES Capability Office will deliver procedures, workstations, switches, servers, cross-domain solutions, communications infrastructure, video teleconference suites, network equipment, storage and backup, encryption equipment, software licenses, infrastructure, deployable suites, Trusted Network Environment (TNE) equipment and software communications. Variations in quantity and unit price reflect planned capital investment. 

Other Procurement funding will:
- Provide and support extension of the US BICES multilateral, and bilateral intelligence information sharing capabilities within each of the Combatant Commands via expanded communications, information technology systems, integrated wide area and meshed networking, deployable containers/elements, and advanced Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC)-IT/Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems (DCGS) releasable analytical applications. 
- Procure the hardware and software needed to establish US BICES-X capabilities as a core infrastructure and enterprise for the intelligence component of the DoD MPE.
- Continue support to the (US as framework nation) US/Coalition Special Operations Forces (SOF) supporting NATO and worldwide intelligence needs for the Global Pursuit mission and the US contribution to the NATO Intelligence Fusion Center at the Joint Analysis Center, United Kingdom (UK).
- Procure work stations, enterprise hardware and software, security accreditation, and network connections supporting strategic, operational and forward deployed warfighting forces in multiple theaters.
- Provide enhanced capabilities for coalition Special Operations Command intelligence sharing capabilities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) procures and supports fixed-base and tactical radar, navigation aids, voice communications, and data processing/automation capabilities which enables Air Force (AF) air traffic controllers to provide advisory, sequencing, separation, and landing guidance services to all aircraft in AF-assigned airspace.  In support of Global Mobility, Agile Combat Support, Global Strike, Homeland Security, and Global Response concepts of operation, ATCALS centrally manages the Air Force's Air Traffic Control capability to ensure Air Traffic Control facilities/equipment can safely and expeditiously support en route and terminal operations in benign and combat areas of responsibility.  ATCALS operational and training systems must be interoperable with systems operated by other services, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), or host nations. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND AIRFIELD OPERATIONS (ATC OPS): ATC OPS provides for procurement of new systems and replacement, modification, or mitigation of diminishing manufacturing source issues of legacy ATC navigation and landing systems, as well as related voice communications, data processing/automation systems, and ancillary equipment such as ATC digital audio legal recorders, flight data input/output systems, electronic flight strip systems, air traffic information systems, terminal instrument procedures, and airfield management systems.  Key elements of ATC OPS are: 

1.  DIGITAL AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) RADIO REPLACEMENT: The ATC ground-to-air Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radios are 30 years old and difficult to maintain.  The Digital ATC Radio Replacement Program will replace ATC fixed-base and mobile ATC tower radios with state-of-the-art systems that will include a remote maintenance capability and 8.33kHz channel spacing (mandatory requirement in Europe by FY2018, completed on time).  In order to ensure system commonality and common logistics support and training, ATC radios are being procured as a centrally managed item by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Tinker AFB.  Approximately 5,400 radios will be replaced. 

2.  DEPLOYABLE RADAR APPROACH CONTROL SYSTEM (D-RAPCON):  D-RAPCON will replace the 1960/1970s era AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 systems with state-of-the-art digital systems. Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance/ sequencing, air traffic control communications, and automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations.  D-RAPCON can also be deployed with a D-ILS, mobile control tower, and mobile TACAN to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also support domestic disaster relief.  Due to diminishing manufacturing sources, life of type purchases will be required each year. 

3. DEPLOYABLE INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM (D-ILS): D-ILS is a Category I (200ft decision height/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities.  D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions to support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian/disaster relief operations and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet in an area of responsibility.  D-ILS also replaces the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system.  The PAR systems were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable.  On average, only four of 14 mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis and none are fully mission capable.  Due to diminishing manufacturing sources, life of type purchases will be required as needed.  A total of 19 D-ILSs will be procured (8 AD, 10 Air National Guard (ANG), and one depot rotable).  D-ILS is normally deployed with the Deployable Radar Approach Control System, a mobile Air Traffic Control Tower, and mobile TACAN.  

4.  ATCALS Fixed Base (FB) Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS) FOS: The FB NAVAIDs FOS program replaces the current 1970s era systems which have reached the end of their normal lifespan, are manpower intensive, and costly to support.  New systems will include remote maintenance, monitoring, alignment, and flight inspection support capabilities via Remote Maintenance Centers (RMC).  One VOR (Active Duty (AD)), 28 VORTACs (25 AD/1 Air National Guard (ANG)/2 Air Force Reserve (AFR)), and 92 fixed-based TACANs (74 AD/11 ANG/7 AFR) were procured from FY2012 through FY2018.  FY2018 was last year of Other Procurement funding.  Installations and organic depot stand-up are on-going, however installations will continue to take place in FY21 and FY22.  Mid-way through the production and installation phase, the program encounter an issue with counterfeit parts in the system's Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS).  The counterfeit parts were sequestered by Dept of Justice while the supplier was being investigated.  The lack of parts impacted production of the UPS which, in turn, prevented the program from performing additional installations.  This installation pause lasted 11 months before the UPS issue was resolved.  Once production commenced, the program was lead-time away from receiving new UPS kits for installation and FAA flight check certification.  This lead-time put the program two years behind PEO-approved APB schedule. With these systems, the AF will have a reliable, adaptable, and enduring capability that will support all joint, coalition, and civil operations.

5.  FIXED BASE PRECISION APPROACH RADAR (PAR):  The fixed base 1970s era PAR AN/GPN-22 systems have been in service beyond its originally planned end of life cycle of the late 1990's.  A replacement is required as the current system is not economically supportable.  Due to the age of the system, maintenance costs, obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources, and reliability problems have increased.  Most fixed base PARs have already been replaced with fixed base ILSs; however, PARs are still required to provide an adverse weather landing capability at select bases. Replacement systems will be procured through an existing Navy fixed price contract.

6.  FIXED BASE INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM (FB ILS):  FB ILS consists of two subsystems which provide horizontal (localizer) and vertical (glide slope) guidance to enable aircraft to make a precision approach to a runway in inclement weather.  FY21 funds procure two systems for installation on new runway at Osan AB, Korea.    

FY19 prior year funding totals include $23.484M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

FY21 funding request was reduced by $39.376 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in Program Element (PE) 0305114F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>BCS-F supports the North American Aerospace Defense Command/ Northern Command (NORAD/NORTHCOM) homeland defense and air sovereignty mission for fixed Air Defense Sectors.

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED (BCS-F): BCS-F is a Bi-national program with Canada. The BCS-F Program is an AF Homeland Defense battle management command and control system with the capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive air picture. BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space. This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression. Life cycle replacement will be required to prevent system obsolescence, account for new cyber security requirements and posture the program to seamlessly integrate future capabilities.

NATIONAL CAPITOL REGION - INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM (NCR-IADS): NCR-IADS is a post-September 11, 2001 rapidly fielded capability that improves low altitude detection capability in order to prosecute airborne threats to the NCR. NCR-IADS provides ground-based air defense of the National Capitol Region airspace, and provides an integrated air picture, ground air defense weapons, enhanced regional situational awareness and forensic data collection capabilities for the warfighter mission to protect the NCR. Life cycle replacement will be required, to prevent system obsolescence, account for new cyber security requirements and posture the program to seamlessly integrate future capabilities.

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM MODERNIZATION: Provides for capital equipment replacement activities at the fixed Air Defense Sectors under the modification efforts for Release 3.2.5 and beyond, which include, but are not limited to: infrastructure upgrades, future Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), and replacement of other equipment that does not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM) funding.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>- NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION - INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM (NCR-IADS): FY2021 funds will include, but are not limited to, support hardware upgrades to seamlessly integrate new and emerging sensors, data, and technologies. Funds will be utilized for hardware upgrades and spares that do not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM) funding, updated configurations of existing sites to match the modified baseline, and hardware to maintain the mandated cyber security posture and Authority to Operate (ATO) requirements.

            <proc:Description>CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER (CRC)

The CRC is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations to provide direct command and control to all air assets in an assigned Area of Responsibility (AOR) and to report back to the Joint Force Air Combat Commander (JFACC). The CRC is a family of systems which include: AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), AN/TSC-147, AN/TRC-213/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS), and the AN/TPS-75 Radar, CRC's organic radar. Air Combat Command (ACC) CRC Capability Roadmap provides for the modernization of this family of systems and will be programmed into phased updates through 2037. Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues. 

In order to meet warfighter requirements, the CRC will be modernized incrementally. These efforts are projected to begin in FY21: AN/TRC-213/214 RRSVS radio modernization production and European Defense Initiative (EDI).

            <proc:Description>PE 0305111F WEATHER SERVICE 

The Weather Observation Forecast (WOF) procurement line acquires fixed-base and tactical meteorological equipment, ground-based space environment sensing systems, and information systems supporting the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) lines of effort. WOF procurement also ensures a dependable environmental observing network which was identified as one of the key layers in Air Force Warfighting Integration Capability's (AFWIC) blueprint for the sensing grid that enables joint all-domain command and control (JADC2). This funding rebuilds readiness for a more lethal and resilient force by procuring and upgrading fixed and tactical equipment for observing and forecasting terrestrial and space environmental impacts in support of global AF, Army, and Special Operations forces and the Intelligence Community.  Funding to procure and upgrade information systems to process, store, analyze and disseminate decision-grade weather information enables accurate prediction of environmental impacts to optimize mission planning and execution, targeting, weaponeering, and battle damage assessment and enhances the effectiveness and survivability of AF and Army weapon systems, precision munitions, and AF and government agency space systems.  Alliances are strengthened through weather system technological upgrades to ensure critical interoperability with DoD, allies, and interagency partners in support of multi-domain combat operations.  Funding for WOF also ensures greater performance and affordability through improvements to architecture and system efficiency as well as retirement of legacy equipment.  

WOF activities align under four capability areas: 1) Weather Data Collection, 2) Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, 3) Weather Forecasting, and 4) Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications (PTWA). This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions. Procurement funding for Terrestrial and Space Environment Observation Forecast is in Program Element (PE) 0305111F, Weather Service. In FY2021, procurement funding and activities aligned under PTWA will begin to transition to Weather Data Collection to better align data collection efforts. PTWA will only include RDT&amp;E activities once this transition occurs.

1. Weather Data Collection Systems: Provides automated atmospheric and ground-based space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide. The data gathered by multiple sensor systems is exploited for environmental battlespace awareness, characterization, safety of flight, resource protection, and satellite anomaly assessments and impacts. 

A. Observing System 21/AN/FMQ-23 provides automated weather observing systems both home station and deployed to collect weather elements for aviation surface weather reports. Program actions include but are not limited to the acquisition of new weather systems/sensors and the normalization to a standard weather sensing, modular open system architecture (MOSA) baseline comprised of fixed and tactical weather collection components. In FY2021, the FMQ-23 Observing System will begin a transition to a new Program of Record called Fixed-Base Weather Sensors that will combine the FMQ-23 Observing System along with several other fixed-based weather observing systems and sensor collection appliances (sensor collection appliances are currently aligned under PTWA) in order to create a common sensor baseline and consolidate contract maintenance costs.

B. Ionospheric Ground Sensors (IGS)—IGS capital equipment replacement consists of fielding Next Generation Ionosonde (NEXION), Ionospheric Scintillation Total electron content Observer (ISTO), and other similar equipment.  Data from IGS is transmitted via the unclassified DoD network, Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet), to the Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS) at the 557th Weather Wing, Offutt AFB.

Funding is used to replace obsolete computer equipment, backbone infrastructure hardware and software, and long haul communications equipment at the Weapon System Support Center (WSSC) Ground Test Facility (GTF), and contractor laboratories. This includes COTS items such as computers, displays, printers, disk and tape drives, software (e.g. computer-aided design (CAD) and analysis software) as well as engineering and logistical support. Funds also procure specialized computers that provide on-line access to B-2 aircraft data and low observable analysis capabilities. Unique B-2 security and communication infrastructure needs are also addressed. 

The B-2 Weapon System Support Center (WSSC) Ground Test Facility (GTF), located at Oklahoma Air Logistics Center, Tinker AFB, OK, supports two critical functions: aircraft software development and maintenance/support, plus systems engineering support for the fielded weapon system. Software maintenance fixes to aircraft systems include flight controls, flight management, navigation systems, weapons/armament and the defensive management system. These software fixes are accomplished and tested with the use of the WSSC software development system and integration/test laboratory complex by analyzing and designing fixes to the existing aircraft software. The WSSC GTF also provides engineering support with specialized computer systems that provide online access to B-2 aircraft data. This data consists of items such as engineering and organic low observable analysis, manufacturing, aircraft design data used to help solve technical issues on the B-2. Locations where this data is used include Tinker AFB, Whiteman AFB, Wright-Patterson AFB, Northrop-Grumman in Palmdale, CA and forward operating locations (FOL).

PE 0101316F Worldwide Joint Strategic Communications - P-40A

Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) are highly structured, authenticated messages primarily used in the command and control of nuclear forces. They are disseminated over numerous survivable and non-survivable communication systems including terrestrial and space systems. Programmed funds procure system components, spares, software, and necessary support services for systems such as the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS), Phoenix Air-to-Ground Communication Network (PAGCN), Defense Injection Reception Emergency Action Message (EAM) C2 Terminals (DIRECT), Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE), the Strategic Emergency Action Transmission System (SEATS), and the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN).

SACCS is a secure Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) system that directly supports National Command Authority (NCA) communications in the command and control of strategic and non-strategic forces. SACCS enables the NCA to disseminate Higher Authority Command Messages, Force Direction Messages, EAMs, and automated ICBM re-targeting data to the USAF's two legs (ICBM and bomber fleets) of the nuclear triad; the reconnaissance, tanker, USAFE munitions, and Special Operations communities; and to other Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve DoD users worldwide. 

DIRECT includes the hardware and software to enable the NCA to transmit nuclear and non-nuclear EAMs and other time-critical messages to strategic and non-strategic forces. The equipment requested is representative of those items capable of providing the required operational capability. The specific items procured may vary depending upon available technology at the time of procurement. Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

PAGCN is a critical component of the Senior Leadership Command, Control and Communications System (SLC3S) that extends terrestrial Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) connectivity via an air-to-ground line-of-sight (LoS) communications path to select Airborne and Ground Mobile platforms, and provides and air-to-air LoS communications path between PAGCN-equipped platforms. The FY2018 NDAA directed the transfer of the PAGCN program from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to the Air Force Program Executive Office for Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (AFPEO NC3). Additional information can be provided at higher classification levels.

                    <proc:Remarks>In FY20 the C2 Facility Fit-Out project has no funding.  Last year of Procurement funding was FY19.

Beginning in FY20 the USSTRATCOM IT Enterprise Construct is adapted - PE 11301F, BPAC 835160

The C2 Mod, FSAM, and JWAC programs will now be reported under the C2 IT Enterprise program 

PE 0101301F - USSTRATCOM Information Technology Enterprise...consists of 6 major efforts: 

a.  Installation Process Node Hardware Lifecycle Management - Equipment delivers cloud-based Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) server core capabilities.  Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) server resource management includes access control and lifecycle management.

b.  Computer Network Defense - Security operations will begin lifecycle technical refresh of hardware to enable the monitoring, protection, analysis, and detection of malicious activities affecting USSTRATCOM and component subscriber enterprises 

c.  Network/Communications Hardware Updates - FY20 starts equipment updates for network administration and control devices for the USSTRATCOM enterprise networks and Internet control sharing systems

d.  Client Infrastructure Hardware Updates - Lifecycle technical refresh will begin on end user computing input/output devices and peripherals. 

e.  Audio Visual/Video Tele-Conferencing (VTC) Hardware Updates -Technical refresh of audio visual equipment includes audio visual control room equipment, classified and unclassified telephony, digital signage, VTC and audio conferencing capabilities

f.  COOP Capabilities - In FY20 USSTRATCOM will build a continuity of operations capability to host mission critical systems and applications at an off-site location</proc:Remarks>

PE 0305903F - COCOM MOBILE CONSOLIDATED COMMAND CENTERS (MCCC) 

Modification for the COMBATANT COMMANDER (CCDR), MOBILE CONSOLIDATED COMMAND CENTER (MCCC):  The CCDR's MCCC provides command capabilities to accomplish directed missions in the event of a national level emergency.  It provides resilient command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) capability accomplishing directed COCOM missions.  The MCCC provides C4I for Homeland Support/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM).

PE 1203906F - NCMC - ITW/AA SYSTEM 

In FY2021, P-1 Line Item 833160 / Cheyenne Mountain Complex PE 123906F efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3022F, Procurement, Space Force, from Appropriation 3080F due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.  Modification for NORAD CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX-INTEGRATED TACTICAL WARNING/ATTACK ASSESSMENT(NCMC-ITW/AA) SYSTEMS: These systems integrate and correlate missile launch, space object orbit, and air surveillance information to assess the nature of an enemy attack and issue warnings to the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Canada, United States Secretary of Defense and warfighting Combatant Commanders (CCDR). Funding procures replacement for reliability and maintainability of the information systems hardware and associated systems software for Cheyenne Mountain operating locations to include legacy space defense systems at Vandenberg AFB, CA and remote interfacing sites essential for executing US Strategic Command, NORAD, Joint Force Component Commander (JFCC) space missions exercised in the Cheyenne Mountain Complex (CMC), Combined Space Program Operations Center (CSpOC), and forward operating locations.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program, PE 0305903F, P-3A Mod 006, MCCC Upgrade Block 04, is a new start.

PE 0305903F - COCOM MOBILE CONSOLIDATED COMMAND CENTERS (MCCC) 

The CCDR's MCCC provides a resilient command, control, communications, computers, intelligence (C4I), reliability and maintainability capability while accomplishing directed COCOM missions.  The MCCC provides C4I for Homeland Security Support/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) and USNORTHCOM missions.  MCCC modification efforts funded in this line include upgrading MCCC shelters and incorporating additional C4I system capabilities via mobile Information Technology and Communication Upgrade projects; ensuring the platform's ability to rapidly deploy, re-constitute and operate. FY21 funding will execute MCCC Block 04 modifications which include but are not limited to: 1) Communication system upgrades; 2) Mission and support asset upgrades; 3) Cyber security modernization, 4) Network upgrades; and 5) Environmental and Filtration system upgrades along with and including initial spares and test facility updates required by the fielding of these modification.  Due to the limited spares demand rate, and indefinite system lifespan, Life of Type buys may be required to support weapons system modifications across the active MCCC Block Programs.  FY21 funding will also provide Program Management Administration (PMA) support for the MCCC Block 03 Program initiated in FY20.  PMA includes acquisition support/strategy, engineering and technical expertise associated with procurement, support services, test, travel and other program related costs associated with install of procurement equipment.  Funding for this effort is in program element 0305903F and is funded IAW full funding policy.


PE 1203906F - NCMC - ITW/AA SYSTEM 

Funding procures replacement for reliability and maintainability of the information systems hardware and associated systems software for NCMC/ITW/AA system. This system is a C2 enterprise of various critical information technology systems comprised of communications processors, network devices, C2 services, workstations, databases, and intelligence sources that are integrated to provide the means to assess an enemy attack.  In FY21, this line will fund NCMC-ITW/AA Block 04 modifications, which include but are not limited to the two major components: 1) Mission systems (air, missile, and space) upgrades include all subsystems within the sensor-to-operator messaging string message-processing, database, communications processing systems, C2 services, mission operations management systems, and workstations.  2). Network/infrastructure systems for ITW/AA and Space include but are not limited to those sub-systems that provide the fabric for the mission systems to operate within operational and security parameters such as system operations servers, security servers, backup systems, networks and network infrastructure components, support systems software and independent test systems.  Due to the limited spares demand rates, and indefinite system lifespan, Life of Type buys may be required to support weapons system modifications across the active NCMC-ITW/AA Block Programs. Additionally, FY21 funding will support continuation of Program Management Administration (PMA) support for the NCMC-ITW/AA Block 03 program in FY20, the NCMC-ITW/AA Block 04 program initiated with FY20 funding and finally the planning efforts for the NCMC-ITW/AA Block 05 program.  PMA includes acquisition support/strategy, engineering and technical expertise associated with procurement, support services, test, travel and other program related costs associated with install of procurement equipment.  Funding for this effort is in program element 1203906F and is funded IAW full funding policy.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>This program, PE 0305903F, P-3A Mod 006, MCCC Upgrade Block 04, is a new start.
COMBATANT COMMANDER (COCOM), MOBILE CONSOLIDATED COMMAND CENTER (MCCC):

The COCOM's MCCC provides a resilient command, control, communications, computers, intelligence (C4I), reliability and maintainability capability while accomplishing directed COCOM missions.  The MCCC provides C4I for Homeland Security Support/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) and USNORTHCOM missions.  MCCC modification efforts funded in this line include upgrading MCCC shelters and incorporating additional C4I system capabilities via mobile Information Technology and Communication Upgrade projects; ensuring the platform's ability to rapidly deploy, re-constitute and operate. 

FY21 funding will execute MCCC Block 04 modifications which include but are not limited to:  1) Communication systems upgrades; 2) Mission and support asset upgrades; 3) Cyber security modernization; 4) Network upgrades; 5) Environmental and Filtration system upgrades along with and including initial spares and test facility updates required by the fielding of these modifications.  Due to the limited spares demand rate and indefinite system lifespan, Life of Type buys may be required to support weapon system modifications across the active MCCC Block Programs.  FY21 will also fund Program Management Administration (PMA) support for the MCCC Block 03 Program initiated in FY20.

PMA costs fund acquisition support/strategy, engineering and technical expertise associated with procurement activities.  In addition, PMA costs will also support equipment test, travel, and other program related costs associated with install of procurement equipment.  Funding for this effort is in Program Element 0305903F and is funded IAW full funding policy.

            <proc:Description>The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Hardware program procures commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) computing systems hardware and hardware-related requirements for Air Force active duty, Guard, and Reserve units worldwide.  These computing systems provide a flexible, configurable and cost-effective range of increasing capability to meet the continuum of peacetime, contingency and wartime planning requirements.  These electronic systems provide a mission data management system that efficiently interfaces with other planning systems as well as aircraft avionics.  These computing systems are procured on a four-year life cycle replacement to effectively address and/or alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Once procured the systems are centrally managed for all applicable AF platforms and their operational users, including Guard and Reserve Forces.

The program continues the procurement of COTS computing hardware and other devices associated with the Mission Planning Systems program.  It also continues the procurement of all capital replacement hardware used in conjunction with MPS and other pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning software.  Together this hardware and associated software enables aircrews and other planners to plan the safest, most effective operational missions in a timely manner.  

The program procures COTS based Personal Computing (PC) Systems to include (but are not limited to) desktop computers, laptops, personal digital assistants (PDA), tablet PCs, color printers, storage devices, servers, displays, other peripherals, software and software licenses, and other support services, that together, allow the user to produce the necessary charts and other mission-specific products required to effectively perform a variety of military missions. 

A variety of information technology, navigation and communications hardware and software packages will also be procured each year to meet the varied needs of mission planning platforms and training units.  This PC-based capability, when integrated with corresponding mission planning software releases, provides a portable, tailorable, net-centric system for aircrews to complete the mission planning function.  The procured items also enable aircrews to effectively utilize software that has been modified to stay in sync with new capabilities incorporated into select platforms via their Operational Flight Program (OFP) update process.  They also provide a mission planning capability for precision/autonomous guided munitions and can also be networked with other Theater Battle Management (TBM) systems to further tailor a platform's mission planning environment. 

The MPS procurement strategy leverages the rapid increase in PC-based technology to enable high-end computing on increasingly smaller and more mission-oriented devices.  The programs procure PC-based systems that provide flexible, configurable, and cost effective solutions that increase tactical and strategic capabilities to meet the continuum of operations ranging from peacetime contingencies to conventional and nuclear wartime mission planning requirements.  Each segment of the program has shifted its hardware emphasis from a limited number of large, complex planning systems to more compact and personal planning devices that can be tailored to satisfy user needs.  This adjustment is a practical and efficient way to meet technology-driven challenges such as the evolutionary nature of mission planning (that necessitates recurrent hardware changes to meet overall system requirements) and advances in COTS technology that makes available new capabilities (which may lower component costs or address component/interface obsolescence).  It is also a more effective way to address changes in the number, type, and deployment of aircraft/weapons that force changes in the number of PC-based mission planning computers and their concept of operations.  

1. MISSION PLANNING SYSTEMS (MPS) HARDWARE: This acquisition is a continuation of procurement efforts to provide MPS-related hardware for Air Force platforms. The program will provide a suite of COTS-based mission planning hardware and software systems that can be connected to data transfer device systems from USAF aircraft (e.g. F-22, B-1, F-16, F-15, RC/OC-135, E-3, E-4, E-8, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, HH-60, KC-135, KC-46, C-5, KC-10, C-17, A-10, F-35, RQ-4, U-2, B-52, B-2, UH-1, T-38, T-7A) and the support of USAF training requirements. MPS allows aircrews to electronically receive tasking orders, intelligence information, target coordinates, imagery and other information from USAF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems. This information is then used to organize and prepare flight (including equipment and personnel airdrop) and weapons delivery planning data (e.g., maps, charts, imagery, flight logs, radar predications, and navigation databases) that is electronically transferred to aircraft and/or precision-guided weapons. MPS increases the combat effectiveness of Air Force aerial assets (including unmanned air vehicles, conventional and low-observable aircraft, and weapons) and Army guided delivery systems by supporting the use of sophisticated avionics and precision/autonomous guided munitions. It helps to increase wartime sortie rates while improving aircrew and aircraft survivability and aircrew readiness.

2. PRECISION AERIAL DELIVERY SYSTEM (PADS): PADS provides the capability for direct delivery of cargo and equipment through high altitude and low, precision airdrops (principally with C-17 and C-130 aircraft). Currently it consists of the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) acquisition effort. JPADS is a collaborative effort with the Army, USMC, and other agencies to provide aviators the ability to accurately airdrop payloads (including supplies/equipment and personnel) to units in the field from altitudes beyond the reach of some surface-to-air weaponry. This portion of the program procures COTS-based computing hardware, support services and aerial delivery systems to enable completion of pre and in-flight mission planning functions as well as aerial delivery proficiency training in and with operational units.
 
Market surveys and analysis of COTS products will be used to support procurement decisions. This funding request will continue to support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0208006F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>Unit costs vary because different types/configurations of equipment are being procured.

Mission Planning Systems (MPS) and Precision Aerial Delivery Systems (PADS) components are procured as commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) equipment using various contracting methods, vehicles and agencies. Items are procured annually via Delivery Orders (DOs) on a variety of contract vehicles (e.g. Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, and GSA and NASA SEWP IV Contract schedules) and through agencies such as AFWAY/NETCENTS II (Gunter AFB).

Mission Planning Systems (MPS) hardware assets are centrally managed by the Mission Planning System Support Facility (MPSSF) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) at Hill AFB.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>INTEGRATED STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ANALYSIS NETWORK (ISPAN):  The mission of USSTRATCOM is to conduct global operations in coordination with other Combatant Commands, Services, and appropriate U.S. Government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the U.S. and its allies.  It provides full-spectrum global strike, and coordinated space, missile defense, and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives.  USSTRATCOM will also provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  ISPAN enables USSTRATCOM to carry out these missions.  It is one of DoD's most complex classified computer systems and the only national force level planning system.

ISPAN enables an effects-based approach to planning and operations; cross domain information sharing; and serves multiple planning environments.  It develops, verifies, and produces Operational Plan (OPLAN) 8010.  It also supports the USSTRATCOM family of plans construct and current Concept of Operations.  The system performs tasks ranging from creating and running Courses of Action (COAs) on threat scenarios to providing data for developing bomber aircraft crew strike mission data in digital and hard copy formats.  It includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), multiple networks, unique processes and procedures, software, training, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, a test/development environment, and subsidiary systems.  The system will migrate to the new USSTRATCOM Command and Control Facility. 

The ISPAN program is comprised of two independent but complementary planning systems; the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) and the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP-CIE). MPAS is an automated information system to support Global Strike nuclear and conventional target development and weaponeering.  MPAS includes Mission Planning, Analysis, and Decision Support tools and an Enterprise Database to sustain and support nuclear and conventional strategic war planning. GAP-CIE provides web-enabled adaptive planning, rapid distributed Course of Action (COA) development and global situational awareness supporting both contingency and crisis planners.  

ISPAN uses a four-year life-cycle replacement plan for Cyber Investments to procure required Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware (e.g. servers, storage devices, workstations, peripherals and other network components). In some instances the hardware must be combined with commercially available software to form unique planning environments. The program's life cycle replacement plan for hardware Cyber Investments follows industry standards and is used to eliminate the peaks and valleys associated with maintaining compatibility with the fast moving COTS hardware technology improvement cycle. It also allows the program to better utilize existing manpower to install and configure the hardware systems to provide an incremental and efficient replacement of critical infrastructure components as they become obsolete. Hardware and software Cyber Investments procured within the program are used to support all ISPAN program increments. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in Program Element 0101313F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 funding continues the life-cycle procurement of commercial-based hardware and software Cyber Investments for the ISPAN mission system which consists of the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) and the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE) efforts. Funding procures mission system Cyber Investments in the form of infrastructure, architecture, and related support components. Funding also provides a secure cross-domain security solution capability to enable automated data transfers between multi-level networks supporting planners worldwide on multiple enclaves. It allows for the procurement of Cyber Investment items such as (but are not limited to) application servers, switches, storage area network (SAN), backup and recovery systems, guard solution software and other articles that will provide a secure Cross Domain Security Solution (CDSS) capability. Funding also provides for procurement of virtualization technology environments and distributed operations capabilities to support joint warfighters across geographically separated locations. Finally, funding provides Cyber Investments for the initial migration of the ISPAN mission system to the new USSTRATCOM Command and Control Facility.

NOTE: Hardware procured primarily as Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) items in varying quantities, in multiple configurations, from multiple sources, using multiple contract vehicles.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>This program transferred from Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to USAF in FY19.

Mission Partner Environment (MPE) enables secure sharing of operational information for collaboration between and among the U.S. and mission partners to include federal, State, local, and tribal agencies, allies, coalition members, host nations, and other nations, United States and international Non-Governmental Organizations, multinational treaty organizations, and private sector organizations.  The MPE program enables the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD) to execute its assigned missions with mission partners across the complete ranges and phases of military operations to assist combined command and control (C2) of coalition forces while meeting the information sharing requirements within existing bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements. Also, it promotes effective information exchange and provides applications to enable effective use of the United States and Partner nation military power. MPE provides the warfighter mission with technology to improve mission effectiveness and cyber security.

In response to program decision memorandum, funding for Mission Partner Environment transferred the capabilities the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) program, the All Partners Access Network (APAN), and the Combined Federal Battle Labs Network (CBFLNet) to the Mission Partner Environment Program. MPE enables secure sharing of operational information and enhances collaboration between the US forces, and trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort increases combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners. FY21 funding procures hardware and software to support operations with the Mission Partners environment.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM AIR FORCE (GCCS-AF): The GCCS-AF program provides the common AF infrastructure hardware and software necessary to pass AF command and control (C2) data among commands, their components, and the joint GCCS. This program procures GCCS components which include, but are not limited to, items such as servers, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, and associated peripherals to provide users with the full suite of joint baseline capability (including the common operating picture and Integrated Imagery &amp; Intelligence). GCCS-AF is integrated at the following locations to establish initial and full joint connectivity and operational capability across the spectrum of intelligence, operations, war planning, manpower, and logistics: AF-supported war-fighting commands, AF critical sites, Headquarters United States Air Force, Major Command headquarters (MAJCOM), numbered air forces, wings, Air National Guard (ANG) bases, Air Force Reserve (AFR) bases, and remote sites. Each site will comply with current Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) network initiatives by employing a standardized interface among AF base-level classified C2 networks, AF base-level network control centers, and the joint Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This program provides a flexible open system and distributed C2 architecture necessary to support the joint GCCS. GCCS supports AF operations by installing and upgrading a site's classified C2 system through extensive use of COTS technology that adheres to AF command and control, communications, and computer architectures and standards. 

Funding for the exhibit contained in PE 0303150F: GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM

The FY 21 funding request was reduced by $1.719 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM AIR FORCE (GCCS-AF): FY21 procurement funding procures various types and quantities of hardware and software in support of installation and unit mission
requirements for Air Force personnel. GCCS-AF will procure and install GCCS-Joint (GCCS-J) version 6.0 hardware and software (government-off-the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf) at warfighter Combatant Command (CCMD) and MAJCOM locations, providing a full spectrum of command, control, war planning, logistics, and intelligence capability from strategic to unit level operations with total joint service connectivity. The GCCS architecture supports functional users on each base and specifically incorporates war planning functions into GCCS. These fielding activities are consistent with the AF's Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) C2 structure and integration with DoD's emerging next generation joint C2 enabler.</proc:Justification>

This BACN payload is controlled by ground stations that are comprised of multiple support elements: a Payload Control Element - Launch (PCE-L) and Payload Control Element - Mission (PCE-M), and a Rapidly Deployable Payload Control Element (RD-PCE) that provides the same PCE-L and PCE-M functionality in rapidly deployable configuration, and any additional equipment required to support BACN Payload. 

The E-11As require Rapidly Deployable Aircraft Kits that include the minimum number of maintenance equipment and spares required for the aircraft to operate anywhere around the globe for a minimum of 30 days.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This BACN payload is controlled by ground stations that are comprised of two support elements: a Payload Control Element - Launch (PCE-L) and Payload Control Element - Mission (PCE-M).  The Rapidly Deployable Payload Control Element (RD-PCE) will provide the same PCE-L and PCE-M functionality in rapidly deployable configuration.

In order to fulfill a worldwide rapidly deployable requirement, the E-11As require Rapidly Deployable Aircraft Kits. These kits will include the minimum number of maintenance equipment and spares required for the aircraft to operate anywhere around the globe for a minimum of 30 days.</proc:Justification>

GLOBAL MOBILITY COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) ARCHITECTURE AIR MOBILITY COMMAND (AMC): The AMC C2 architecture is an integrated, command-wide program that supports US Air Force airlift/air refueling missions around the globe with centralized control/decentralized execution. To execute America's Global Reach mission, Air Mobility Command's 618th Air Operations Center (AOC) plans, schedules, and directs a fleet of more than 1,100 mobility aircraft.  The 618th AOC operates combat delivery, strategic airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation operations around the world. Funding for this exhibit is contained in program element (PE) 0401840F. 

MOBILITY AIR FORCE (MAF) COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) INFRASTRUCTURE:  Provides base wired/wireless infrastructure equipment supporting AMC's 618th AOC and AMC's 11 bases to assure connectivity to AMC's command and control (C2) systems and to ensure they remain operational at AMC bases and operating locations.  MAF C2 Infrastructure ensures connectivity with critical Air Force systems such as the Information Transport System (ITS), Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and the Global Decision Support System (GDSS); AMC's C2 systems such as the Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) and Advanced Computer Flight Planning (ACFP) system and the infrastructure for Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems across AMC providing intra-base command and control for base security, emergency management, flightline operations/maintenance, and crash response.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MAF C2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>PE 0401840F AMC Command and Control System - P-40A

            <proc:Justification>PE 0207522F Airbase Air Defense Systems (ABADS) - P-40A
FY21 Funding is necessary to combat and deter the proliferation of commercial, military grade and crudely manufactured small fixed-wing and rotary-wing Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) in use around the globe. These items must be effective across the entire spectrum of conflict, from maintaining safety of flight in peacetime to high intensity conflict with a Near-Peer or Nation-State. The funds will advance mature systems and early prototyping for promising science and technology that are candidates for rapid fielding. Funding will also support operational test and evaluation; verification and validation in support of Joint and Air Force urgent operational and emerging operational needs.

                    <proc:Description>INTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE SECURITY SYSTEM (IBDSS-2): Reduces the risk to AF personnel; nuclear (PL-1N), and non-nuclear (PL 1-4) assets (weapon systems, aircraft, command &amp; control systems, etc.) and facilities (hangars, SCIFs, etc.) at AF and ANG installations globally. DoD downsizing, reductions in forward basing, and aircraft technology advances evolved AF weapons systems into increasingly valuable national power projection capabilities. However, the security afforded most AF aircraft, weapon systems, other critical resources, and associated personnel and facilities in terms of equipment or manpower has not kept pace with the changing world environment, state-of-the-art technology and potential threats. The emergence of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) has led to additional command, control and communications nodes that require commensurate protection level security efforts to enable effective Air Force power projection. Force Protection IBDSS projects support long-term physical security requirements which allow installation commanders and security forces to adapt to, and counter, enduring and emergent threats to high priority assets in accordance with home station and the Aerospace Expeditionary Force concept. This continuing effort was previously named Base Physical Security Systems and is not a New Start.


INTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE SECURITY SYSTEM (IBDSS-2): FY21 Funding is provided for procurement, installation, integration, training, acceptance testing, and Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for Base Physical Security Systems (BPSS) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The funding also procures, installs and sustains a variety of electronic security alarms, sensors, and related systems to detect and provide early warning of potential threats against Air Force Protection Level (PL) 1,2,3, and 4 mission critical assets. Funding also supports the Nuclear (PL-1N) Weapon Storage Areas (WSAs) located throughout the CONUS and vault storage areas at main operating bases in Europe to meet long term physical security requirements in the face of enduring and emerging threats. This also includes upgrading existing system to ensure required capability for vault storage areas and associated intrusion detection, access control and assessment systems requirements, In Accordance With (IAW) USAF, EUCOM and NATO/SHAPE requirements. The funds also provide for upgrades, refurbishment, replacement or installation of new fences (required for sensor platforms) and/or lighting systems (to support the surveillance/assessment functions). Due to world-wide operational mission events, quantities are subject to change. IBDSS-2 will procure Tactical Automated Security Systems (TASS) and other tactical/expeditionary equipment that is required to provide robust force protection capabilities worldwide; flight-line security, aircraft, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets, critical infrastructure, sustained sortie generation and air operations, advanced technology force multipliers to include: night vision and thermal imagery equipment, counter sniper/battery capabilities, ground weapons, target acquisition radar, inter operable tactical communications, [required C3 and protective standoff equipment for]wheeled tactical [non-tactical], armored [un-armored] vehicles, tactical sensors systems, and unit/personnel protective field equipment. Additionally, IBDSS-2 will procure all required Technology Integration Management (TIM) and associated integration and interoperability efforts. Defender Multi-Domain Command, Control and Communications (DMDC3) - The DMDC3 initiative will rapidly develop the foundational structure of IBDSS to provide a platform that integrates the computing power, the means of communication, and the tools for situational awareness.

Milestone/Development Status

For Force Protection Commercial Off The Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use. This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C 3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.

Continuing COTS and Modified COTS for system equipment as it becomes obsolete.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Combat Training Ranges (CTR) program procures electronic telecommunication and instrumentation equipment and threat systems for training ranges worldwide to satisfy air combat and electronic warfare (EW) training capability requirements. It also procures range scoring systems and replacement equipment for electronics no longer logistically supportable. Funds may be used to address production Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages(DMSMS)/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.

JOINT THREAT EMITTER (JTE): JTE is designed to train aircrews to survive in a combat environment against Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Air Defense Artillery (ADA) threats. The JTE simulates a range of threat signals, in multiple emitter kits, which interact with the aircraft radar warning receiver and electronic countermeasure system to provide realistic EW training environments for aircrew. The JTE leverages Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) where possible to provide digital signal generation and feedback across its range of threats. The JTE system uses a Command-and-Control Unit (C2U) to operate a Threat Emitter Unit (TEU) contributing to a realistic threat environment for 4th and 5th Generation aircraft. Funding will also be used to purchase services applicable to the acquisition, site activation and implementation of the ground system including range site surveys, installation and training. The program procures new systems, retrofits fielded legacy JTE systems, and procures modifications for obsolete components of the fielded JTE fleet to extend their serviceable life. 

ADVANCED RADAR THREAT SYSTEM VARIANT 1 (ARTS-V1): ARTS-V1 program will procure long-range strategic SAM threat training systems.  ARTS-V1 is designed to be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat.  While various aircraft platforms may train against ARTS-V1, the focus of the program is to deliver realistic threat replication meant to stress 5th Generation aircraft capabilities.  

ADVANCED RADAR THREAT SYSTEM VARIANT 2 (ARTS-V2): The ARTS-V2 program will procure threat training systems based on an advanced tactical, mobile, short/medium range foreign fielded SAM radar threat system. ARTS-V2 is designed to be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat. Various aircraft platforms will train against ARTS-V2, but the focus of the program is on creation of realistic threats meant to stress 5th Generation aircraft capabilities.

RANGE EQUIPMENT: This effort delivers range infrastructure and equipment in order to monitor and control an extended, realistic target environment for simulated ordnance delivery and provide scoring, feedback and debriefing to the aircrew. This effort includes, but is not limited to, the Joint Advanced Weapon Scoring System (JAWSS) program, which consists of Navy-developed scoring and feedback systems that provide weapon impact and laser spot scoring on bombing and gunnery ranges, EW threat subsystems such as noise and spoofing jammers and ground based laser countermeasures and directed lasers as well as radar and detection systems, data link connectivity, target shells, simulations and concealments, integrated air combat training instrumentation for range-less and tethered ground systems, and Range Safety Systems (RSS).   

RANGE COMMUNICATIONS: The Range Infrastructure Modernization Communication (RIMCOMM) program provides communication systems to connect various air defense threat radar systems on Air Force ranges to simulate an Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) and to provide blue force command and control for range operations. Infrastructure modernization includes replacing obsolete equipment, establishing a common infrastructure to support War Rooms and a future Live Mission Operations Capability (LMOC) enabling improved mission debriefs and Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) aircrew training, and standardization of all training range communications systems to support LVC training missions. This program focuses on procurement of range communication infrastructure equipment, including fiber optic cabling, microwave, Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and Very High Frequency (VHF) radios and antennas, data links and repeater stations, power subsystems, control systems, Air Combat Training System (ACTS) ground systems, and cryptological equipment for unclassified and secure communications for all Combat Training Ranges, in addition to studies, analysis, and integration efforts for range command and control, LVC training, and enhanced debrief capabilities. 

MODERNIZATION SYSTEMS: This program procures modifications for multiple legacy Range Threat Systems (RTS) to extend their serviceable life.  RTS efforts include Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES), Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) system, Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) system, Band Simulator (Band Sim), Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) system, legacy Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) systems and other radar systems fielded throughout the combat training range enterprise. The program may procure depot stand-up tools such as software support workstations.  

COMMON ELECTRONIC ATTACK RECEIVER (CEAR): The CEAR program replaces the obsolete Electronic Attack Receivers (EAR) on legacy threat systems such as the Unmanned Threat Emitter (UMTE), the Joint Threat Emitter (JTE), and the Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES). The CEAR provides real-time and recorded electronic warfare feedback to Combat Air Force (CAF) aircrews, improving their survivability in anti-access/area denial combat environments.

            <proc:Description>The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments.
 
Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces and Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS) and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews. 
 
Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. 

Global ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment. FY15 was the first year of Increment 1 procurement funding to support pre-production activities. The majority of pre-production support activities were conducted in FY17 and FY18 in advance of the Milestone C decision in 3QFY19.

RDT&amp;E funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0303131F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Global ASNT Increment 1 FY2020 funds will support production activities including preparation and planning for depot standup, engineering activities, schedule preparation and planning, production configuration control, production roadmap activities, procurement of 42 production kits, site installations, and initiate interim contractor support (ICS).

FY2020 funds also include purchases of Electronic Security Systems (ESS) to provide Physical Security Level 3 (PL-3) protection for Global ASNT antennas. Global ASNT is replacing a PL-4 asset.

FY2021 funds will support installation, ICS, and Program Office activities including planning for depot standup, engineering activities, schedule preparation and planning, and production configuration and control.

This program has overarching diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) requirements and as such may need to use procurement funding to address these requirements.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) program provides homeland defense sensors to North American Aerospace Defense Command/US Northern Command (NORAD/USNORTHCOM) for air surveillance and cruise missile defense of the National Capital Region (NCR).

WAS consists of two advanced sensor systems, the Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) and Scorpion, incorporated into a single WAS System.  Based upon existing technological capabilities, WAS detects/tracks low, slow and other asymmetrical threats in the airspace and meets the user needs of sensing stressing airborne targets in complex environments with affordable sensors. The sensor outputs are incorporated into the Battle Control Systems-Fixed (BCS-F) air picture and utilized as the NORAD/USNORTHCOM Command and Control (C2) air surveillance system of record.

The WAS strategy is an acquisition approach for full capability to produce and field highly capable and sustainable advanced sensors in the NCR. In FY21, the Air Force plans to award and exercise WAS Production and Interim Contractor Support (ICS) Contract options for both STARS and Scorpion systems as well as procure initial spares and repair parts.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0604445F, Wide Area Surveillance.

Some aspects of the WAS program are classified and information will be provided on a need-to-know basis.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Will include but are not limited to:
- FY21 funds will procure, produce and field operational STARS and Scorpion sensors, provide ICS for fielded sensors and procure and maintain system infrastructure such as a system integrated lab and system health and monitoring centralized data processing capability to support operations and support activities in accordance with NORAD/USNORTHCOM.
- FY21 funds will include program management administration and direct mission support providing management, engineering, cost and technical support for the program office.
- FY21 funds will support potential diminishing manufacturing sources, material shortages,  obsolescence solutions, sparing, and recapitalization to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.
- Some key components of each WAS site require significant lead time items.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>PE 0207439F Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) - P-40A
DISTRIBUTED MISSION OPERATIONS AND THREAT CHANGE ANALYSIS: Conducted by the 453rd Electronic Warfare Squadron (453 EWS), EWIR provides analytical capabilities and reachback support for DoD acquisition , planning and mission execution activities. These capabilities ensure electronic warfare (EW) systems and integrated combat platforms correctly recognize and respond to enemy, friendly and noncombatant systems operating within the electromagnetic environment. The effort includes funds used to procure specialized information technology systems used to identify electromagnetic spectrum emitter changes that impact combat defensive and electronic warfare systems and to conduct detailed analyses in support of operational mission planning, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development, acquisition and test &amp; evaluation. These analyses provide the means to understand the performance of their systems in hostile environments, directly impacting the survivability of combat-coded USAF aircraft and aircrews. Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207439F.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2020, Other Procurement funding realigned to WSC 83410, General Information Technology, for clarity in reporting.

PE 0208088F AF DEFENSIVE CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS (DCO)

CYBERSPACE VULNERABILITY  ASSESSMENT /HUNTER (CVA/H): Equipping the Cyber Protection Teams (CPT) and Mission Defense Teams (MDT) to Full Operational Capability of CVA/H equipment (Garrison Interceptor Platform (GIP), Deployable Interceptor Platform (DIP), Mobile Interceptor Platform (MIP), and Information Operations Platform. CVA/H provides 1067 Development with 3600 RDT&amp;E funding; and in return the emerging 1067 3080 requirements are funded to procure and field new capabilities that have been solutioned /tested.  Note: P-5 quantities are reportedby # of CPTs fielded vice # of subsystems (MIP, DIP, GIP, IOP-FAK).  Reporting is intended to better articulate the quantities of the CVA/H WS being procured.

CYBERSPACE DEFENSE ANALYSIS(CDA): Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA): The CDA Weapon System (WS) conducts Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) and network defense by monitoring, collecting, analyzing, and reporting sensitive information transiting or residing on the AFNet.  Without proper funding the CDA PMO will not be able to procure vital hardware and software that supports the CDA Weapon System, as well as delivery of additional 1067 capabilities.  These capabilities include Weapon System Technology Refreshes (4 Network Warfare Squadrons, 8 AF Gateways, 2 Area Processing Centers), additional two Radio Frequency Monitoring Suites (RFMS) (increase to 8 total suites), Enterprise Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Monitoring (184+ AF Sites), and other essential mission requirements.  FY21 funding is essential in sustaining and maintaining the CDA Weapon System to combat the rapidly evolving cyber threats.

            <proc:Description>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

DEAMS user deployments include:
- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
- U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and Joint Base San Antonio
- Air Force Material Command (AFMC), and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) 
- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs

On 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increments. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Increment (Inc) 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (FD ATP) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. FD ATP date is August 2020 and Capability Support Authority to Proceed (CS ATP) date is February 2021.  

DEAMS was designated as an Agile Pilot program in the FY19 NDAA.

DEAMS will require software user licenses to support system deployments as well as potential software and hardware requirements needed to manage, execute, and deliver DEAMS system capability including necessary system upgrades. 

This requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver DEAMS system capability.

Procurement funding prior to FY19 for DEAMS was in PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development (FMISD). Funding for this exhibit contained in PE0901554F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction
to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Funds are used to procure software user licenses and other potential hardware and software using multiple contracts and various vendors. Software license counts are estimates and may vary at actual execution based on system needs. 

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>MAINTENANCE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL INITIATIVE (MROI):
MROI creates an integrated capability that plans, schedules, and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter. The items being procured are commercial software licenses to allow limited/full deployment. The software is known to work in commercial environments. MROI will test the Air Force configuration of the software in DISA environments with added Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Extensions (RICE)objects.
Testing will be performed as part of the System Implementer activities. The contract was awarded 11 Jul 2018. MROI DT&amp;E is projected for Mar 2020, IOT&amp;E is projected for Apr 2020 and FOT&amp;E is projected for Jan 2022. 

Maintenance Repair and Overhaul Initiative will be using, for the first time in FY 2019, 3080 funding to support CY 2022 delivery of the MROI capability currently under development (RDT&amp;E). Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.  

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0708055F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In FY 2019 MROI was a new start.

The FY 2020 procurement dollars in the amount of $1.912M procure various types/amounts of software in support of unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.  The budget reflects funding to procure production software licenses in quantities sufficient to support the MROI user community based on multiple release strategy.

No funding was requested for FY 2021.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System, is the weapon system that the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for monitoring, planning, executing and assessing theater-wide air and space operations in support of the air battle campaign to meet the Combined/Joint Force Commander's (C/JFC) objectives.  

The AOC WS contains over 50 Command and Control (C2) systems/applications (3rd Party Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)/Government Off the Shelf (GOTS)) that are continually being updated under monthly, quarterly and annual efforts (i.e. Agile Release Events (AREs), Critical Security Update (CSU), etc.). The AOC WS 10.1 integrates these changes as well as provides periodic Capital Equipment Replacement (CER) to keep the AOC WS interoperable, supportable, and compliant (e.g., certification and accreditation). Fielding will provide Joint C2 interoperability, and respond to the highest priority Combatant Command (CCMD) interoperability problems including: (a) incorporating fixes to shortfalls in interactions with CCMD targeting support systems, (b) enhancing the effectiveness of the operational picture to respond to the proliferation of sensors, and (c) handling data interface changes being experienced with older 3rd Party program deliveries. Major subsystems have enhanced their security profile and this fielding will serve as a re-accreditation of the overall AOC WS baseline. Primary efforts in fielding include CER and baseline updates via variously sized Baseline Releases (BR). BRs include regularly scheduled 3rd Party COTS/GOTS application updates. They are normally comprised of hardware/software changes/updates/modernized improvements/modifications and security patches. Each BR is based on warfighter-validated needs that require updates to the AOC WS 10.1. The AOC Block 20 Modification effort delivered a hybrid cloud-based Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS/PaaS) to the AOC WS baseline. The hybrid cloud includes on premise hardware, software and commercial cloud computing services that host and provide air operations capabilities to the AOC enterprise.

The AOC WS funding provides system hardware, software, technical documents, CER (e.g., replacing end-of-life/end of support Direct Mission Support (DMS) and 3rd Party components), core radio and initial training to standardize and sustain the AOC WS. This includes the integration, test and fielding of cyber security improvements and existing 3rd Party modernized improvements/modifications (e.g., replace paper copy with electronic requests). The fielding and CER consist of AOCs and their associated support sites (e.g., Help Desk, Formal Training Unit (FTU), experimental sites, and Air Reserve Component sites). 

There are three distinct categories of AOCs: Geographic, Global (formally known as Functional), and assorted AOC Support Functions (Help Desk, Field Training Unit (FTU), Operational Support Facility (OSF) and Air Reserve Component sites). While all sites start with the standardized 10.1 baseline, each is specifically tailored to the needs of the associated Geographic CCMD or Global (formally known as Functional) Command. Thus, as no two AOCs are alike, when a CER or BR is accomplished, each site is unique and requires its own specifically designed site-engineered fielding plan and associated hardware, which drives differences in site specific (i.e., unit) costs.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207410F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>1. FIELDING: Primary efforts include integration and fielding of improvements/upgrades of existing 3rd Party applications as well as newly developed replacement applications, CER (replacing end-of-life/end of support components) and baseline updates via variously sized BRs.

   a. CAPITAL EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT (CER): FY21 funds will be used to support moving the AOC baseline toward a cloud-based commercially managed Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS/PaaS) hosting platform/environment and address numerous commercial end-of-life and DMS components including components associated with C2 applications (3rd Party COTS/GOTS) that must be resolved. 

   b. BASELINE RELEASES (BR): FY21 will fund BRs, periodic maintenance upgrades, emergency fixes, cyber security improvements and other activities (e.g., testing activities). 

   c. FIELDING SYSTEM PROGRAM OFFICE (SPO) SUPPORT: FY21 funds will be used to provide government oversight, technical expertise, and program office support associated with the fielding of AOC. 

   d. TEST SUPPORT (45th / 47th Test Squadron [45 TS/47 TS]): FY21 funds will be used to provide government oversight and technical expertise associated with the testing of AOC.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>1). Due to different levels of complexity, differences in equipment to be updated, and length of required time necessary for modification, the total cost will fluctuate between fiscal years.

2). Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between mission specific needs and differences in site type i.e., Geographic vs. Global (formally known as Functional) vs. Associated Support Site vs. Air Reserve Component Sites) will drive differences in site specific requirements (e.g., time required, hardware required and software required). This makes quantification impossible, as there is no single baseline to produce a quantity against. Per DoD Financial Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 4, Exhibit P-5 Instruction, the quantities in the P-5 are left blank as there is no way to report applicable quantities.

3). Funding was established in the FY 2020 PB request to initiate a multi-year effort to consolidate the operations for 3 AOCs at one location and the Air Force is still working on the Concept of Operations and Plan of Action for this effort.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>BASE INFORMATION TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE (BITI), formerly known as INFORMATION TRANSPORT SYSTEM (ITS): BITI delivers base-level Air Force cyberspace network and integrated information infrastructure for Air Force installations (active duty, reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG)) and Geographically Separated Units (GSU) at approved locations. BITI capabilities encompass base level information transport systems (wired and wireless), digital voice/data/video systems, commercial device connectivity, Unified Capabilities (UC) and the systems to manage, protect and maintain these capabilities. BITI provides a robust and secure wireless infrastructure that incorporates high-availability and multi-tiered network connections at approved facilities to support mobile Airmen. Finally, BITI will have a consolidated cyber capability addressing emerging cyber threats to infrastructure. The end result is a unified high-speed packet switching and circuit transport system providing acceptable mission-defined user experience connectivity at point of mission need. The efforts in this program budget line, through its various increments and major projects and coupled with efforts of other Air Force IT portfolios, ensure the fielding, support and sustainment of standard, enterprise information transport systems  while enabling the evolution of improvements that include, but are not limited to, data center consolidation, cloud based services, and mobile computing. As UC evolves, to include but not limited to voice, BITI will respond with expanded bandwidth to provide the necessary throughput.

BITI will ensure that Air Force operating locations have sufficient infrastructure, bandwidth, and overall network capability to support the current and future communication needs of the Air Force and Joint-Command warfighter via reliable and survivable information transport with sufficient capacity and capability to meet the classified and unclassified data, voice, video, imagery, and telemetry requirements at each installed location.

BITI Recapitalization: Replaces "backbone" infrastructure of network equipment on a routine basis for fielded Air Force installations (active duty, reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG)) and at approved GSUs.  More comprehensive recapitalizations may be required as part of technology insertion to ensure the fielding, support and sustainment of standard, mission capable Enterprise IT transport to fulfill warfighter information needs.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the armed forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303112F until FY 21. From FY 21 and onward funding will be contained in PE 033004F.

The FY 21 funding request was reduced by $13 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>BITI:  FY21 funding includes, but is not limited to, implementation and upgrades to broadband, fiber-optic digital information transport networks to provide mission-critical information transfer capabilities at fixed Air Force bases (Active Duty, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard) and selected geographically separated unit locations.  Procurement efforts include, but are not limited, site surveys, installations, and interim contractor support (ICS).

BITI Recapitalization:  FY21 continues replacement of BITI on Air Force Turnkey fielded systems (5 year cycles).</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>These programs support Cyberspace Activities.

AFNet provides Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to implement, deliver and upgrade installation processing nodes and boundaries, AF NIPRNet Gateways, Information Management Suite, enterprise network security, network situational awareness and C2 capabilities, and allows for the interface with and assured movement of information from terrestrial, air and space-based networks, thus enabling Air Force Information Operations (AFINOps). All funds used for AFNet Systems support the continued establishment and transformation of the AFINOps construct toward the standards and specifications of the DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE). The procurement efforts in this program budget line include, but are not limited to, system equipment, engineering/integration, certification and accreditation, deployment, testing, training equipment/systems, associated training and interim contractor support. Procurements implement technology and capabilities within the AFNet in accordance with the DoD IT Roadmap, AF Information Dominance Flight Plan, AF Cyber Blueprint and the AF Network Action Plan. All activities may incorporate support to other program elements across the Air Force Information Enterprise in accordance with SAF/CIO direction, the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI), previously known as the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI), and the JIE strategy.

Beginning in FY21, Other Procurement Funding for UP realigns from WSC 835080 AFNET to WSC 834320 C3 Countermeasures for clarity in reporting.  

PE 0303089F, CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS SYSTEMS 

This PE executes requirements for both AFINC and CSCS weapon systems. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

(1) AIR FORCE INTRANET CONTROL (AFINC): Procures and installs equipment for network operations, network defense and overall management of the AF NIPRNet Gateways (GW), the Information Management Suite (IMS) and the base Service Delivery Point Routers as well as the Air Force discrete requirements associated with the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). Efforts include, but are not limited to: AFNet NIPR GW (MAC-1 system) and SIPR GW, which deliver critical network defense capabilities for the AF enterprise with over 800k users directly supporting flying, maintenance, space and cyber operations across the full range of military operations. GWs prevent and detect unauthorized network infiltration attempts and automatically initiate network defense countermeasures to eliminate the adversary's ability to gain access to the enterprise. With the migration of all Air Force installations to JRSS the Air Force will decommission the GWs. The IMS provides the Air Force with secure, real time, out of band network management for the weapon system infrastructure and unifies the management/defense of AF networks and assets. Funding includes recapitalization of the IMS as well as procures equipment upgrades that directly relate to the migration of AF traffic and technology transition from the AFNet NIPR Gateways to the JRSS. 

(2) CYBERSPACE SECURITY AND CONTROL SYSTEM (CSCS):  Procures and installs capabilities contributing to cyber mission assurance, including proactive defense and persistent network operations for the Air Force, the Air Force-provisioned portions of the DoD Information Network (DoDIN), and the Air Force Information Network (AFIN). CSCS modifications support the following activities: fault resolution to maintain operational capabilities; lead-in coordination activities at base-level Network Control Centers for necessary network security actions; monitoring of AF network services; managing of boundary protection devices and the Air Force network infrastructure; and continuous network situational awareness. Efforts include, but are not limited to: Data Center Consolidation and migration to the JIE; upgrade to the Core Services and the Air Force Vulnerability Management (AFVM) and Network Management.

FY21 funds will procure modifications for CSCS and AFINC.  CSCS includes, but is not limited to, Vulnerability Management, Area Processing Center and Regional Data Center Consolidations, Installation Service Nodes (ISNs), Installation Processing Nodes (IPNs), Active Directory Exchange (ADX), Host Based Security System (HBSS), Enclave NIPR Firewall and ASIM Sustainment (ENFASS)(previously under ACD) and base boundaries.  AFINC includes, but is not limited to, Gateway e-mail security/DNS upgrades, Dual Path Resiliency, and SDP Router tech refresh.

PE 0303228F, JOINT INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT (JIE)

JIE is not a new start.  This effort was previously funded under PE 0303089F and is now under PE 0303228F.

JOINT INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT (JIE): This PE executes the requirements for JIE.  Funds may be used for other AFNET requirements.  DoD leadership has established and is tracking JIE implementation tasks that incrementally address diverse key categories that include but are not limited to: JRSS, Network Consolidation, Security, Enterprise Services, Application Rationalization, Enterprise Licensing, Mobility Service, Cloud Computing, and Installation types (e.g., Core Data Centers, Enterprise Operations Center, etc.).  Much of the Increment 1 effort focuses on delivering and implementing reference and solution architectures and artifacts, developing TTPs needed to operate JIE capabilities (with global instantiation), defining and establishing an initial set of enterprise services, and establishing the governance processes critical to JIE management.  Similar implementation tasks will be established for PACOM and CONUS during Increments 2 and 3 respectively.  JIE funding may be used to maintain the current architecture of the AFNET while JIE implementation is ongoing.

FY21 funds will be used to implement the federal and DoD CIO mandated Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Router Network Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) to Internet Protocol (IP) transition as well as tech refresh provider edge (PE) routers installed in 2016.  The funding will also be used to fund AFNET network infrastructure, security, and enterprise services initiatives that will ensure AF compliance and supportability of DoD cloud initiatives.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PEs 0208088F, 0208099F, 0303089F, and 0303228F.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>PE 0303089F, CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS SYSTEMS 

This PE executes requirements for both AFINC and CSCS weapon systems. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

(1) AIR FORCE INTRANET CONTROL (AFINC): Procures and installs equipment for network operations, network defense and overall management of the AF NIPRNet Gateways (GW), the Information Management Suite (IMS) and the base Service Delivery Point Routers as well as the Air Force discrete requirements associated with the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). Efforts include, but are not limited to: AFNet NIPR GW (MAC-1 system) and SIPR GW, which deliver critical network defense capabilities for the AF enterprise with over 800k users directly supporting flying, maintenance, space and cyber operations across the full range of military operations. GWs prevent and detect unauthorized network infiltration attempts and automatically initiate network defense countermeasures to eliminate the adversary's ability to gain access to the enterprise. With the migration of all Air Force installations to JRSS the Air Force will decommission the GWs. The IMS provides the Air Force with secure, real time, out of band network management for the weapon system infrastructure and unifies the management/defense of AF networks and assets. Funding includes recapitalization of the IMS as well as procures equipment upgrades that directly relate to the migration of AF traffic and technology transition from the AFNet NIPR Gateways to the JRSS. 

(2) CYBERSPACE SECURITY AND CONTROL SYSTEM (CSCS):  Procures and installs capabilities contributing to cyber mission assurance, including proactive defense and persistent network operations for the Air Force, the Air Force-provisioned portions of the DoD Information Network (DoDIN), and the Air Force Information Network (AFIN). CSCS modifications support the following activities: fault resolution to maintain operational capabilities; lead-in coordination activities at base-level Network Control Centers for necessary network security actions; monitoring of AF network services; managing of boundary protection devices and the Air Force network infrastructure; and continuous network situational awareness. Efforts include, but are not limited to: Data Center Consolidation and migration to the JIE; upgrade to the Core Services and the Air Force Vulnerability Management (AFVM) and Network Management.

FY21 funds will procure modifications for CSCS and AFINC.  CSCS includes, but is not limited to, Vulnerability Management, Area Processing Center and Regional Data Center Consolidations, Installation Service Nodes (ISNs), Installation Processing Nodes (IPNs), Active Directory Exchange (ADX), Host Based Security System (HBSS), Enclave NIPR Firewall and ASIM Sustainment (ENFASS)(previously under ACD) and base boundaries.  AFINC includes, but is not limited to, Gateway e-mail security/DNS upgrades, Dual Path Resiliency, and SDP Router tech refresh.

            <proc:Description>JOINT COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT ELEMENT (JCSE): JCSE, assigned under Joint Enabling Capabilities Command, US Transportation Command, is the only joint Department of Defense (DoD) unit specifically formed to provide command, control, communications, and computers (C4) systems support for Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) contingency operations worldwide. The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) mission is to provide, on short notice, those critical communications required to support Joint Task Force support (JTF) and Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) headquarters. These assets support the warfighter's ability to deploy rapidly and immediately provide the positive command and control required. This support includes contingency and crisis communications for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commands, Services, Defense agencies, non-Defense agencies, and foreign governments. Program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with the maximum capabilities, smallest footprint, lowest operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. Per Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and Director, Joint Staff Memorandum (DJSM)0291-14, the Air Force is mandated to fund 1/3rd fair share of JCSE's validated Modernization Program.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207422F, Deployable Command, Control, and Communications (C3) Systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>JCSE: FY21 base funding procures communications equipment based on Strategic Planning Guidance.  This includes the maximum capabilities for narrowband, wideband and  protected satellite communications (SATCOM) terminals and systems, tactical radios, terrestrial communications systems, satellite hubs, networking elements, virtual appliances, Video Teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities, alternative power solutions, Airborne /En-Route, Forced Entry, Cyber Security, and Mobile Joint C2 equipment. Advancements in technology have provided opportunities to modernize current equipment sets with enhanced capabilities to meet the program goals which include meeting emerging real-world operational and cyber defense requirements with maximum capabilities, the smallest possible footprint, lowest operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. This equipment is a critical part of Command, Control and Communications packages that provide direct operational support to joint forces and HQ elements deployed to austere locations around the globe. Per the Planning Guidance, the Air Force is mandated to fund one-third of the fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan. JCSE's Program is built/restructured based on Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service Components' requirements and emerging technologies. The Services influence JCSE's spending plan through recommendations in concert with Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>PE 0201122F USCENTCOM COMMUNICATIONS 

HQ USCENTCOM's mission is to work with its national and international partners in promoting development and cooperation among nations, responding to crises, and deterring or defeating state and transnational aggression in order to establish regional security and stability across its entire Area of Responsibility (AOR). Since USCENTCOM's AOR, covering the Middle East, includes the challenges of regional stability and violent extremists, this Combatant Command's mission is critical in regards to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). To meet its mission responsibilities across this geographical expanse, HQ USCENTCOM must rely heavily on Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) systems capable of achieving full spectrum information superiority. 

Funding for this effort is contained in PE 0201122F USCENTCOM Communications.

USCENTCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: Effort will provide end of life replacement for, but not limited to, Command and Control (C2) systems (thin client, server, etc), Joint Information Environment (JIE), classified and unclassified voice, data and video dissemination, storage area network (SAN) infrastructure, establishment of mission partner networks such as but not limited to; CENTCOM Partner Network (CPN), CENTCOM Partner Network Extended (CPN-X), Mission Partner Environment Information System (MPE-IS),and other coalition partner networks which provide secure networks for bilateral / multilateral information sharing up to the SECRET RELEASABLE level. Support maximum data storage capacity requirements for HQ war records collection, Modeling &amp; Simulation Systems (J8MS), and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) required for the command's collateral classified and unclassified data networks. This equipment provides HQ USCENTCOM with effective C4 systems to effectively conduct current and future operations throughout the AOR.

PE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS

Air Forces United States Central Command (AFCENT) is the ACC component designated to support USCENTCOM operations in deployed theaters for the AF. Funds C4 systems throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). Procurement efforts include: communications infrastructure requirements, satellite terminal equipment, data network servers and associated information assurance tools, information transfer nodes and routers, joint radio relays, as well as deployed air traffic control and landing systems and navigational aid systems. AFCENT funds/support our portion of CENTCOM directed mission partner initiatives such as CPN X to ensure interoperability.

Funding for this effort is contained in PE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>PE 0201122F USCENTCOM COMMUNICATIONS 

USCENTCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: FY21 funding will procure C4 equipment items required for HQ USCENTCOM, MacDill AFB, FL, Disaster Recovery Site (Site X), and CENTCOM Forward HQ at Al Udeid, Qatar, to effectively conduct communications support missions impacting Command and Control (C2) and operational missions conducted by the Commander and staff. The C4/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be replaced to meet the ever increasing demands of current, ongoing contingency operations, and the growth of data storage requirements. 

STORAGE CAPABILITIES: HQ CENTCOM and CENTCOM Forward HQ require maximum storage capabilities to maintain a level of readiness, reduce server footprint, and continue capabilities as they are implemented. 


PE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS FY21 funds will provide:

BASE COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, AND INTELLIGENCE (C4I) INFRASTRUCTURE. This FY21 effort will support communications CENTCOM Theater Posture Plan (TPP)locations identified for post OEF support. This effort is required at several AFCENT locations in the AOR and will provide critical infrastructure to support the transition to the Joint Information Environment, as required by DoD CIO mandate. Mode 5 mandate requires AFCENT obtain transition devices for theater radars to ensure proper C2. Developing infrastructure must be funded to support counter Unmanned Aircraft System technologies and new technologies for air domain awareness. Replacement for aged Air Traffic Control And Landing Systems equipment is required.

Southwest Asia - THEATER ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS - AFCENT must procure new system to support contingency operations and base opening/closure requirements, which average 2 base openings and closing per year regardless of new or ongoing contingencies. A new Jordanian Base (MSAB) has been added to the enduring base list and commercialization projects are underway to complete transition from tactical support to enduring infrastructure.

JOINT INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT: Implementation of JIE at MacDill AFB with SAF/AA establishing a global node at HQ USCENTCOM. HQ USCENTCOM will collaborate with the DoD stakeholder community to implement the Joint Information Environment to include cloud infrastructure and digital transformation capabilities.

FY21 effort will continue to support infrastructure and services essential secure networks for bilateral and multilateral information up to the secret releasable level. Support the networks and cross domain solution necessary to securely and safely integrate coalition sensors and C2 capabilities with C2 efforts. Includes integration of Coalition operations into our Combined Air Operations Center at Al Uedied AB</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The USSTRATCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL FACILITY (C2F) IT Enterprise will incorporate all facets of the previously reported within PE 0303255F, USSTRATCOM C2 SYSTEMS LIFECYCLE HARDWARE MANAGEMENT (old C2 Modernization), ANALYSIS AND TARGETING, and FORCE SURVIVABILITY, ANALYSIS, AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FSAM). The USSTRATCOM REPLACEMENT FACILITY FIT-OUT program does not have funding in FY20. All programs and systems will now ride on enterprise infrastructure, and be reported under BPAC 835160 PE 11301F, except the GDC2 program. It will continue to be reported under PE 0303255F, but is a separate program included in BPAC 835160.

This is not a new start.

     a. USSTRATCOM C2 SYSTEMS LIFECYCLE HARDWARE MANAGEMENT:  This effort provides the C2 infrastructure and hardware to acquire, process, and deliver information, as needed, to enhance decision making for USSTRATCOM.  This effort employs a set of underlying information services, technologies, and tools that enable the Commander of USSTRATCOM to achieve broad operational warfighting capabilities.   The C2F IT Enterprise adds capability as it builds to a final architecture. The cyber architecture is a collection of distributed databases and applications, integrated through a grid of supporting services. This effort was previously referred to as "C2 Modernization and reported under BPAC 833140, PE 0303255F and is NOT a new start.

Beginning in FY20 this program will be captured under the USSTRATCOM IT Enterprise construct, BPAC 835160, PE 0101301F

     b. ANALYSIS AND TARGETING - JOINT WARFARE ANALYSIS CENTER (JWAC):  effort provides the hardware that enables the JWAC to develop and recommend strategic technical solutions.  JWAC coordinates directly with the staffs of all Unified Commands, Department of Defense (DoD) elements, Combatant Commands, military services, and other government departments and agencies to respond to crises.

Beginning in FY20 this program will be captured under the USSTRATCOM IT Enterprise construct, BPAC 835160, PE 0101301F


     c. FORCE SURVIVABILITY, ANALYSIS, AND MANAGEMENT: Provides a decision support system and is designed to provide the commander with Force Management (pre attack) and Force Survival (post attack) information needed to ensure survival of strategic forces.  Provides the commander vital decision making data by correlating strategic force status reported by Force Status Reporting (FSR) with missile attack warning information. Processing and Display Subsystem - Migration (PDS-M) will continue to provide the commander with missile attack warning information

Beginning in FY20 this program will be captured under the USSTRATCOM IT Enterprise construct, BPAC 835160, PE 0101301F

     d. GLOBAL DISTRIBUTED COMMAND AND CONTROL (GDC2):  Detailed information is classified and will be provided on a need to know basis. For further information please contact the Strategic C2 Systems Branch (SAF/AQID) at (202) 404-3405.  This effort will not be reported as part of the IT Enterprise.  GDC2 will continue to be reported under PE 0303255F within BPAC 835160

     e. USSTRATCOM REPLACEMENT FACILITY FIT-OUT:  No funding in FY20 and out</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>USSTRATCOM IT Enterprise - This effort provides the Command and Control infrastructure and hardware to acquire, process, and deliver information, as needed, to enable and enhance decision making for USSTRATCOM.  USSTRATCOM is tasked with vital roles for our nation.  These roles require secure and survivable infrastructure in order to conduct strategic planning, warfighting operations, provide global situational awareness to the National Command Authorities and Combatant Commands, aid the President's nuclear response decision-making process.

PE 0207418F TACTICAL AIRBORNE CONTROL SYSTEM EQUIPMENT
Tactical airborne control system equipment encompass three types of simulators that provide scenario based training for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs), Combat Control Teams (CCTs), Tactical Air Control Party (TACPs), Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) and various Close Air Support (CAS) Platforms.
Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS): TACP fixed-site (dome and desktop configurations) and portable Simulators comprise JTC TRS.  These simulators  provide realistic training to operations personnel for planning, coordinating and controlling close air support in support of ground forces engaged in combat operations by providing both a stand-alone and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)-capable high-fidelity JTAC and joint fire support simulation system.  The JTC TRS is capable of connecting to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support, C2 (including ASOC) and ISR platforms with JTACs and CCTs to train together in a risk-free environment to develop the skills required to support the National Defense Strategy (NDS). The fixed-site and portable simulators enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking.  The primary focus is to provide a virtual training environment for networked air-ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC and CCT skills and train aircrew to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to friendly ground forces. JTAC simulators are fully interoperable with joint/other service air ground simulation systems using common DoD and industry standards.  Training with simulators has the potential to reduce civilian casualties, collateral damage and fratricide by improving coordination skills between air and ground personnel, and increasing JTAC, CCT, and aircrew proficiency. The acquisition strategy for production and sustainment of the fixed configuration of the JTC TRS is being executed as an evolutionary acquisition approach using incremental development. Fielding of the initial domed and desktop system capability was completed EoCY 2019.  Operational units have quickly integrating these systems into training programs to facilitate more realistic and affordable training than can be achieved in the live training environment. Requirements for additional numbers of systems have been approved by the MAJCOMs to support increased JTAC and CCT qualification and readiness for deployable JTACs, and manpower growth IAW AF Program Action Directives.  Program efforts are ongoing to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within the simulator systems to maintain a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

PE 0207422F DEPLOYABLE COMMAND, CONTROL, and COMMUNICATIONS (C3) SYSTEMS

THEATER-DEPLOYABLE COMMUNICATIONS (TDC) PROGRAM: TDC is used to extend network data, voice and video services to expeditionary and battlefield forces. The TDC system provides stand-alone communications support for the full range of military operations and communications capability for Command and Control (C2) reach back at and above the tactical level for a variety of Air Force missions. TDC provides a rapidly deployable communication infrastructure package, which provides deployed users with secure and non-secure voice service, internet access, local area network, network management, information assurance, e-mail services (NIPR/SIPRNET), and intra/inter-base connectivity services similar to those established on a fixed base. The TDC packages: Small Communication Package (SCP), Medium Communication Package(MCP), Large Communication Package(LCP)use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to support a wide scope of expeditionary missions ranging from a small C2 and airfield mission, supporting 1 to 150 users, and up to the stand-up of an Air Expeditionary Wing supporting 3,000 users. The TDC packages also support Special Missions, to include noncombatant evacuation and disaster relief efforts, US Secret Service support, and Homeland Defense Operations. The LCP and MCP mission packages are being restructured into a more scalable package, the Flexible Communications Package (FCP), which will provide a range of support for most all missions. The Air Force's new adaptive basing concept requires an increase in the number of packages needed to meet the mission.  The quantity of FCPs is significantly more than the MCP and LCP quantities.  The FCP consists of SATCOM, Integrated Communications Package (ICAP) and Network Control Center- Deployed (NCC-D) components.

The TDC program reached full operational capability in 2008. TDC procures and installs end of life/end of support equipment to maintain full operational capability. Recapitalization addresses Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues associated with COTS components and ensures TDC maintains compliance with security mandates/directives and cryptographic standards.  

THEATER-DEPLOYABLE COMMUNICATIONS (TDC) procurements consist of ICAP, SATCOM, and NCCD components. Recapitalization cost is based on the quantity of equipment, number of users they support, and the configurations of the three components. Size of recapitalization packages vary from year to year. 

a. SATCOM (formerly HUB AND SPOKE SATELLITE TERMINALS): Satellite terminals provide two-way communications connectivity between expeditionary bases and reach back, through Defense Information System Agency (DISA) gateways/teleports, to the global information grid. These terminals provide DOD X and Ka Band (Super High Frequency) resources and provide access to Ku band commercial satellite services. TDC's Small and Medium Satellite terminals improve the expeditionary workforce's bandwidth throughput for high-speed voice, data, video, and imagery transmissions. Small aperture SATCOM terminals supporting direct internet protocol connection capable of supporting multi-commercial and military transmission bands significantly reduce airlift requirements and provide flexibility during expeditionary operations. 

b. INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS PACKAGE (ICAP): ICAP provides the distributed base backbone which includes: hubs/routers, switches, multiplexers, secure/non-secure telephones, secure conferencing, cryptographic and timing equipment, and intra-base connectivity using fiber and/or point-to-point radios. ICAP packages include accessories and configuration kits to tailor the capability of voice and data modules (i.e. cards to interface to the host nation postal telegraph and telephone). ICAP packages are modular which allows assets to be deployed incrementally and provides the capability to expand the network as the base population increases.

c. NETWORK CONTROL CENTER-DEPLOYED (NCC-D): NCC-D provides deployed network management, information protection, and network planning capabilities similar to those at fixed bases. Specific functions include data management, intrusion detection, and firewall capabilities for both the classified and unclassified networks. The services provided through NCC-D are the core services to the communication hub and these Core Services will be the focus of the Flexible Communications Package (FCP).

DEPLOYABLE AIR FORCE LEAD Joint Task Force (JTF) Communications Equipment: PAD D-18-01 directed the establishment of a standing capacity to provide Combatant Commanders and Air Force, unit-based capability to command and lead the core functions of any JTF. The JTF capable HQ aligned against the Global Response Force must be a deployable communications equipment system that enables the HQ to an adaptive, agile, scale-able, and responsive force.  The JTF HQ communication package is to deliver the ability to operate with a relatively small footprint, to provide globally-oriented C2 capabilities, to flexibly aggregate and disaggregate forces quickly and efficiently, to integrate multi-domain effects across the spectrum of conflict and afford the service an opportunity to develop solutions that are informed from a unique perspective. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Advanced Communications Systems PE 0207423F
PE 0207423F Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEMS (TRS)
Tactical Radio System (TRS) are commercial off the shelf software programmable tactical radios that provide voice, data, and video communications for military users in the air, on the ground, and at sea.

Common radio architecture and programmable software waveforms will provide joint interoperability between the services. The TRS program is built around an open system software communications architecture (SCA), a critical set of rules that make software programmable radios function properly and ensure interoperability. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207423F.

PE 0207444F Tactical Air Control Party-Mod - P-5
TACTICAL AIR CONTROL PARTY-MODERNIZATION (TACP-M): TACPs are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. 

The purpose of the TACP-Modernization program is to upgrade TACP voice, data and video communications capabilities, upgrade targeting capabilities, and improve TACP battlefield awareness capabilities. These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Centers (ASOCs), Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce close air support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications. 

TACPs also coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from tactical operations centers (TOCs), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols. 

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in three major areas: Operation Center Systems, Vehicle-Mounted Systems, and Close Air Support System (CASS) software. The TACP-M program also works closely with the Battlefield Airmen Office program to procure dismounted JTAC equipment. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities.  Frequent TACP combat deployments sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments.

PE 0408011F SPECIAL TACTICS / COMBAT CONTROL

BATTLEFIELD AIRMEN OPERATIONS KIT (BAO Kit): BAO Kit will deliver a Family of Systems (FoS) that provides a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and also provides a family of systems for all Air Force Specialty Codes supporting the Special Tactics (ST) community within the Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen Program. This program will procure and enhance technologies for battlefield airmen ST operators that are inter-operable with US and coalition special operations dismounted forces. BAO Kit allows the ability to recognize, identify, range, nominate, and designate targets during both day and night. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, fix, track, target, and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre- and post-strike, and transmitting target data to command and control centers.

PE 0207444F Tactical Air Control Party-Mod - P-5
PE 0207444F TACTICAL AIR CONTROL PARTY-MOD
TACTICAL AIR CONTROL PARTY-MODERNIZATION (TACP-M) ACQUISITION CATEGORIES: (1) Mounted Systems (used in fixed operations centers and tactical vehicles), (2) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (3) Close Air Support System (CASS) software. FY21 funding will procure the following:

A. MOUNTED SYSTEMS: TACP communications systems are the primary enablers of CAS operations on the digitized battlefield, with operations center systems for fixed locations as well as mounted systems used in tactical vehicles: 

1. Operation Center Systems: TACP operations center systems include the fielded ASOC Gateway and Gateway Light systems, the transportable Dismounted Communication Package (DCP) systems mounted in transit cases, and in the future will include the TACP Transportable Gateway (TTG).  The TTG will provide the capability to receive and transmit digital messages on data link networks at the ASOC and Division and Brigade-level Tactical Operations Centers (TOCs). The TTG will provide battlespace awareness capabilities and line-of-sight, near real time data communications with aircraft for digitally-aided close air support operations. TTG will be a transportable system within 1 or 2 transit cases and include one SCA compliant radio for SATCOM or LOS networked data communications, a small form factor link 16 radio, a power supply capable of using generator and commercial power, a computer to host TACP CASS software and data link control software, and all necessary masts, antennas, and cables.

2. Vehicle Systems: TACP vehicle systems include the GRC-259 system mounted in Stryker armored vehicles, an interim 2-channel mobile voice communications packages mounted in new M1165 High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), as well as the Mobile Communications System (MCS) for M1145 HMMWVS. These systems utilize Software Communications Architecture (SCA)-compliant multi-band radios, tactical video receivers, computers, and ancillary equipment required to conduct CAS voice, video, and data communications. 

Following delivery of the MCS, the TACP-M program intends to procure or upgrade multi-channel data communications systems for M1165 HMMVs, M113 armored personnel carriers (used by TACPs supporting Army armored or mechanized Brigades), and the future Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).  The AMPV and JLVT are new armored vehicles in development by the Army to replace the aging M113 and HMMWVs vehicles, and will be adopted by Air Force TACPs as well.  Specific requirements and acquisition strategies for those systems will be developed after contract award for the M1145 MCS.  In addition, the TACP-M program office expects to modify communications systems currently mounted in Stryker armored vehicles.  This modification will provide a remote control capability required to conduct TACP communications from an Army Stryker Brigade tactical operations center (TOC). 

B. DISMOUNTED EQUIPMENT (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations): 

1. OPERATIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM (OCS)/COMPUTERS: Ruggedized Dismounted JTAC Computer Kits and ancillary equipment required to support Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) data communications with C2 nodes, other TACPs, and attack aircraft. These kits will also provide data link communications through the ASOC Gateway, targeting displays, map and imagery displays, and data JTACs need to compose, transmit, and receive CAS messages with minimal heads-down time during battles with enemy forces. The computers will accommodate TACP Close Air Support System (CASS) software upgrades that include Human-Machine Interface (HMI) improvements and implementation of Joint Digitally-aided Close Air Support standards published by the Joint Staff. Finally, they will provide cable systems and integrated power management capabilities that will extend battery life and reduce the number of external cables that present a snagging hazard during combat operations and are easily damaged. Kit quantities procured in FY17 may change depending on final unit prices, and interim support services may be funded as part of this procurement effort.

2. HANDHELD LASER TARGET DESIGNATORS (LTDs)/RANGEFINDERS (LRFs): TACPs require, smaller, lighter, handheld laser target designators and rangefinders (LTDs/LRFs) to replace the large, heavy Ground Laser Target Designator (GLTD) II devices currently fielded with TACP units. Dismounted TACPs/JTACs do not normally carry GLTD IIs on patrols due to the large size and weight of the device and the fact that it requires heavy, expensive, military batteries that increase the JTAC's combat load.  In earlier years, TACP-M funding helped support system development in the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program that is developing new handheld Target Location Designation System (TLDS) components for use by joint terminal attack controllers and artillery forward observers to improve target acquisition during all-weather conditions.  Pending final Army development and production decisions, the TACP-M program may join the Army to procure these components.  Emerging off-the-shelf technology, however, can also deliver a handheld LTD in a significantly smaller and lighter form factor suitable for use by dismounted JTACs.  Quantities and funding required will depend on final unit prices and TACP force structure when funding is available.

3. MULTI-SPECTRAL THERMAL MARKING DEVICE / BEACON:  TACPs require a small, lightweight, covert, and positive identification capability that can be seen or detected with CAS aircraft targeting pods or other sensors. Current TACP/JTAC "marking" capabilities are limited to marking panels and Laser / IR pointers that can be seen by enemy personnel using night vision devices.  A flashing thermal marking beacon that emits in the mid- and long-wave IR spectrum is required to mark friendly troop/JTAC locations in order to avoid fratricide and improve mission effectiveness.

4. SMALL/LIGHT GPS RECEIVER MODULE: New small/light GPS receivers reduce the size and weight of equipment JTACs must carry to execute their combat mission and reduce equipment sustainment tasks that distract JTACs from their primary mission.  TACP CASS mission software provides full moving map, navigation, and targeting functions that only requires GPS position, velocity, and time inputs.  A smaller / lighter Selective Availability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS receiver module that provides position, velocity and time data to the dismounted TACP CASS software is required to reduce Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) burdens for dismounted JTACs.  Replacing the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) with a small, light SAASM receiver will reduce the size and weight of JTAC equipment loads and also reduce the number of batteries JTACs must carry to power their equipment.

5. SHORT WAVE INFRARED (SWIR) LASER SPOT DETECTOR/TRACKER: A SWIR capability will provide JTACs with improved ability to detect and track laser spots from ground laser designators and airborne laser targeting pods and allow JTACs to confirm that the laser spot is illuminating the correct target or adjust the laser spot before weapons are released.  Current TACP laser spot detection capability (the See Spot III) is large and heavy, provides limited capability during daylight, and is limited by smoke, haze, rain, fog, and thermal crossover conditions.  New off-the-shelf technology, however, provides SWIR viewing devices that can detect and track laser target designator spots through haze, fog, or smoke and is not susceptible to thermal crossover conditions.  

C. TACP CLOSE AIR SUPPORT SYSTEM (CASS) SOFTWARE INTEGRATION: TACP CASS software enables digital data communications with joint C2 nodes, other TACPs, attack aircraft, and Army C2 and Fire Support systems. It includes interfaces with ASOC, TACP and JTAC radios, and targeting devices.  It also provides battlespace awareness capabilities needed to plan, request, coordinate, and control CAS missions. FY17 funding will be used to provide software maintenance updates for fielded versions, provide new Human Machine Interface (HMI) interfaces for a dismounted version of the software, incorporate new joint Digitally-aided CAS standards, and provide contract technical and help desk support to operators employing the software.

The TACP-M program will also use FY21 funding to support Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for equipment such as, but not limited to, Operational Control Systems (OCS) and targeting devices prior to transitioning to long-term sustainment.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

PE 0207423F Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEMS (TRS)
Tactical Radio System (TRS) are commercial off the shelf software programmable tactical radios that provide voice, data, and video communications for military users in the air, on the ground, and at sea.

Common radio architecture and programmable software waveforms will provide joint interoperability between the services. The TRS program is built around an open system software communications architecture (SCA), a critical set of rules that make software programmable radios function properly and ensure interoperability. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207423F.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>This capital equipment replacement program procures, integrates, and fields High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) high frequency (HF) radio equipment, network infrastructure, and transmit /receive antennas for 13 strategically located ground stations worldwide and 2 network control stations. The hardware and integration is based on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that have been configured for the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide the unique military capabilities required to function as a strategic HF system. The need for modern, robust, and dependable radio stations with beyond line of sight radio coverage has been identified to ensure HF radio communications is available in areas of interest to the United States. 

HFGCS is the DoD's single global, strategic, high-power HF Nuclear Command, Control and Communication (NC3) and non-nuclear Command and Control (C2) network serving the DOD. HFGCS consists of the two major components: the radio /network infrastructure (Scope Command) and the antenna infrastructure (Antenna Program Support) which communicate with mobile assets (aircraft, ships, and land-based platforms). HFGCS is USSTRATCOM's primary strategic HF pre-attack NC3 dependency system providing broadcasts to the US Air Force bomber and US Navy TACAMO fleets. HFGCS supports aircrews, ground forces, naval operations (USN and USCG), and control stations, and is the primary C2 resource for Air Mobility Command cargo and tanker aircraft. Additional customers include White House Communications Agency (WHCA), Defense Communications System HF Entry, and other US government agencies. HFGCS supports war plan dissemination and daily operational requirements for USSTRATCOM, WHCA, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), National Military Command Center's Emergency Action Message distribution, Special Air Mission communications, Major Air Force Commands and Combatant Commanders. HFGCS provides radio connectivity to other governmental organizations such as the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, State Department and Civil Air Patrol. The HFGCS network supports Overseas Contingency Operations with secure, robust, physically diverse terrestrial and airborne transmission paths providing information services between fixed and deployed operating locations. HFGCS has also been identified as a key communications component in supporting operations in a satellite anti-access area-denial (A2AD) environment. 

The HFGCS program continues to update audio switching equipment, receive matrix equipment, and other unsupportable end-of-life components and to provide increased mandated information assurance system security compliance requirements. This requires technical refresh of the unsustainable equipment and communications infrastructure supporting NC3 /C2 operations.  Included is also Direct Mission Support /Program Management Administration (DMS /PMA), System Engineering, Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC) installation testing and shipping costs for these procurement efforts. 

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303133F. 

Military Necessity:  Controlled Item will be funded with investment funds to purchase military communications equipment classified as critical protection items.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>1. SCOPE COMMAND RADIO/NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE: The Scope Command Radio/Network Infrastructure projects continue the implementation of replacement commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) radio and console capabilities into the HFGCS network. The FY21 HFGCS Network Infrastructure program includes, but is not limited to, the Unified Capabilities/Audio Communications Functionality (UC/ACF) switch technical refresh and obsolete Receive Matrix Replacement. This funding request will also support potential diminishing manufacture sources and material shortages (DMSMS) and obsolescence solutions for radio equipment and network hardware/servers, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity. Funds will be utilized for hardware updates/integration and initial spares that do not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM) funding to include, but not limited to, updating existing site configurations to support modified network baselines and mandated cyber security compliance requirements.

A. FY21 funding continues the Unified Capabilities/Audio Communications Functionality audio switch technical refresh to replace the obsolete and unsupportable 1990s era audio switch.  This replaces the obsolete Digital Electronic Switch (DES), as neither the IDPX-1000 nor Liberty Star-3 (LS-3) switch is on the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) approved product list (APL) and have become logistically unsupportable.

B. FY21 continues funding the global replacement of the new 15 Receive Matrices at the 13 radio stations, system integration lab, and spares. Funding integrates existing infrastructure to control the new Receive Matrix. The existing receive matrices have become obsolete with no spare parts being manufactured to maintain the capability to interface between the radios and antennas. 

C. FY21 begins funding the Radio Procurement for Operational Reliability (RAPTOR) effort, integrating a replacement of legacy obsolete radios with software defined radio technology.  This multi-year effort will technical refresh all operational radios located at the 13 radio stations world-wide and the system integration lab.

2. HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL ANTENNA REPLACEMENT: A majority of the HFGCS system antennas have been in operation for over 35 years and have been subjected to degradation due to exposure to severe environmental conditions such as salt water and hurricane force winds. FY21 funds continue the replacement of critical antennas at HFGCS sites; actual locations and antenna selections will be based on technical assessment of the antenna condition and the operational requirements of the weapon system during execution. FY21 efforts include, but not limited to, replacing 5 antennas across the enterprise. This funding request will support potential DMSMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity. Funds will be utilized for hardware updates and spares that do not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM) funding to include, but not limited to updating existing site configurations, compliance with local site installation restrictions, and mitigation of potential local environmental considerations.

3. FY21 funds for program management administration costs will provide travel, financial management, engineering and technical support for the program office. FY21 also funds Direct Mission Support, including support associated with engineering, sustainment engineering, shipping, and implementation. This includes operational acceptance testing and technical interchange meetings.</proc:Justification>

2). Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between mission specific needs and differences in site type will drive differences in site specific requirements (e.g., time required, hardware required and software required). This makes quantification impossible, as there is no single baseline to produce a quantity against.</proc:Remarks>

Visual Information Activities - Strategic PE 0102890F - P-40A
Imagery Acquisition and Audiovisual (AV) systems and their products are used throughout the Air Force to inform and train warfighters and to document combat operations and other events of historical significance. Combat video documentation is used for operational reporting and analysis, situational awareness, battle damage assessment, intelligence and operational analysis, casualty identification, and the historical record. In addition, video and multimedia based products are developed for warfighter operations, readiness training, medical videography, public and internal information, testing and evaluation, and corporate communications. Commanders recognize that imagery quickly conveys very accurate and unbiased information, and are requiring greater amounts of video imagery to help meet the challenges of a very active warfighting force. The Air Force is meeting this challenge by dedicating funding to procure and sustain this important capability by replacing older video studio systems with newer and more capable equipment and systems for both Air Force video production and combat/contingency documentation teams. Imagery acquisition systems are centrally managed to establish and maintain standardization of systems, as well as to ensure full interoperability with all other electronic image acquisition, transmission system formats, and presentation systems used in the Air Force.

WESTERN TEST RANGE DIGITAL IMAGING SYSTEMS: This program replaces obsolete, 35+ year-old high-speed engineering film cameras with high-speed digital imaging systems and also upgrades Optical Tracking Mounts to accommodate the new digital imaging systems. This capital equipment replacement procures items to maintain current capability. These cameras are mounted on mobile optical tracking systems and on camera towers next to the launch pad to provide detailed slow motion photography of the launch events. The cameras support satellite, ballistic, missile defense, and aeronautical missions on the Western Test Range and at Kodiak Island, Alaska. The optical data acquired by these engineering camera systems is a vital part of post flight performance analysis of all space and ballistic launch operations and is critical for Test and Evaluation programs now being conducted by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) at Vandenberg AFB. Optical tracking provides detailed engineering sequential photography for anomaly resolution and accident reconstruction at distances up to 60 kilometers, and is required for all current and future MDA tests and Delta IV, Atlas IV, Delta II, Peacekeeper, Minuteman, Airborne Laser, Kinetic Kill Vehicle, and commercial space launches. These digital systems replace film camera systems that are no longer logistically supportable.

            <proc:Description>PE 0604281F Tactical Data Networks Enterprise - P-40A
Tactical Data Links (TDL), as a subset of the broader airborne network, are used in a combat environment to exchange information such as messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond-Line- of-Sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications. TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the data link to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions. TDLs are used by all service theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.
TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Link 22, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL),  Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL),  Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) and Airborne Extensible Relay and Over the Horizon Network (AERONet) . TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016E) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS. 
Funds will be used to procure Tactical Data Link Planning, Analysis and Monitoring (TDL PAM) tool for various locations and applications.  Full motion video effort includes equipment, fielding support, contractor support, and training.  These systems will add capability to modernize CONUS/OCONUS ground based strike decisions in the hostile environment.

Parts support for Talon Archer at the North Warning System Sites

PE 0305114F Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) - P-40A - Low Cost Modifications
Fixed base and deployable ATCALS low cost modifications are initiated to resolve diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues and minor system deficiencies/improvements identified through the ATCALS Weapon System Review-Executive Council (WSR-EC), policy TO 00-35D-54 Deficiency Reports, and Material Improvement initiatives. The implementation of these low-cost modifications decreases maintenance costs and improves system operational availability. The return on investment for these low-cost modifications will be realized immediately through decreased unscheduled depot and field level maintenance, enhanced performance, and operational safety. The operational availability of terminal navigational aids, national airspace systems, and precision approach and landing systems are at risk if low-dollar modifications are not provided to reverse unfavorable operational availability metrics.

PE 1203909F Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) - P-40A
PE 1203909F The Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) is a ground based radar system with missions to support the Missile Correlation, Space Surveillance, and Missile Defense Centers. The BMEWS radars provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) penetrating the coverage area including Launch and predicted impact (L&amp;PI) data for attack assessment and response determination.  BMEWS also supports the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) network providing near-earth satellite surveillance and tracking, reporting observational (metric), SOI on man-made satellites and maintenance of the space catalog as required by the Joint Space Operations Center, Alternate Space Operations Center, and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center mitigating the significantly increasing potential for collisions with national assets, including manned space platforms.  The BMEWS shares a common baseline and mission with the PAVE Phased Array Warning System (PAVE PAWS) while deploying more array elements on its faces.  The Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) sites at Thule and Fylingdales also have a Missile Defense (MD) mission supporting the Missile Defense Agency.   These radars are located at Thule Air Base, Greenland; Clear Air Force Station, AK; and Royal Air Force (RAF) Fylingdales, UK.  Additionally there is a site for testing (System Program Agency) located in
the Centralized Integration Support Facility (CISF) at Peterson AFB, CO.

Guardian Angel Family of Systems (GA FoS):
Guardian Angel is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airman Modernization Program. Guardian Angel is a family of systems based on human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Combat Search and Rescue and personnel recovery across a full spectrum of military operations. GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force Specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) and Combat Rescue Officer (CRO). GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical and SERE.  Representative items include but are not limited to parachute equipment, technical recovery equipment, information management systems (including Preservation of the Force and Family), enhanced night vision systems, support equipment vehicles and ground transportation, rescue watercraft and a Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) Training Simulator (simulator, maintenance &amp; mobile shelter costs) to supplement,  augment, and optimize current training events, independent of aircraft availability to align with strategic plans of the Next Generation LVC for training within the DoD. The enhanced night vision systems will include continued Procurement of Night Vision solutions that improve personnel recovery night visions systems with wider field of view, lower SWAP, and/or enhanced vision in at least one spectral band other than Near-IR. Procurement is required to meet mission needs until the next generation of multi-spectral NVGs are developed and available for ground crew operators. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements. This includes applicable training, spares, and repairs. Starting FY17 and thereafter, all funding and tasks for BPAC 842140 Night Vision Goggles have been moved to BPAC 842990 Personal Safety and Rescue Equipment.  This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions,to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.  Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.  Funding for GA FoS is in Program Element 0207227F. 

Special Tactics/Combat Control Special Warfare program funds Air Force standardized equipment within the overarching Special Warfare Modernization program for Special Tactics combat controllers, pararescue personnel, combat weather operators, and tactical air control parties to perform their Air Force Special Operations Command Mission. Funding for this effort is in program element 0408011F. Representative items include but are not limited to training and simulators, assault zone, airfield marking tools, approach landing capability, weather data collection and analysis, personnel and technical recovery equipment, visual augmentation, unmanned capabilities, aerial insertion, ground transportation and vehicular support equipment, and maritime. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements. This includes applicable training, spares, and repairs to manage, execute, and deliver Special Tactics weapon system capability. This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity. Due to the rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.

Modern warfare resulted in an increase in airborne combat under the cover of darkness. Night missions include ground operations, preparation of the aircraft for take-off and landings in complete darkness, lights-off air refueling, and visual identification of enemy targets hidden under the night sky. Consequently, ground personnel and aircrew require the capability to see in very low visibility conditions at night and high ambient light conditions such as full moon or heavily lighted residential areas. The use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG) is critical for combat rescue, special operations, and homeland security missions. 

A lack of night vision capability would significantly decrease combat effectiveness in night operations, risk flight safety, and increase the probability of fratricide. Aircraft such as HH-60 helicopters, HC-130s, F-16s, and special mission C-130s primarily operate in low altitude environments during covert night operations. Hence, NVGs are vital to the success of these missions, providing a dramatic increase in safety, situational awareness, and survivability during the execution of near daytime tactics, including visual formation criteria. Furthermore, the proliferation of NVG-equipped adversaries underscores the urgent need to supply ground and air forces with night vision equipment.


Program changes in progress.  This applies to PEC 0408011F.

Human Systems Program Office Items Less than $5M:
This program saves Airmen's lives and improves aircrew performance through better aircrew flight equipment and airman combat systems.  Procures safety and rescue equipment for increased protection of aircrew personnel operating manned, non-space aircraft to optimize weapon system effectiveness and capability throughout the full spectrum of military operations. In general, the purpose of the PE is to expand the combat capabilities of a weapon system an airman supports while balancing functionality, comfort, and safety. Representative items include flight helmets, oxygen breathing equipment, flame resistant/ retardant and blast/ballistic protective gear, laser eye protection, personnel locator beacons, nuclear flash blindness devices, personnel parachutes, ejection seats/equipment, night vision goggles, survival radios, associated test sets, life rafts, life preservers, anti-exposure coveralls, aircrew flight ensembles, physiological monitoring devices, test sets &amp; Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kits and other air/ground crew equipment.  Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements.

Ground and Aircrew Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and Binocular Night Vision Device (BNVD) with associated test sets and kits. The type of NVGs included the monocular night vision device which is a hand-held, head-mounted, helmet-mounted, or weapon-mounted night vision system that enables walking, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, map reading, vehicle maintenance, and first-aid administration during moonlight and starlight conditions. The difference types of NVGs support a vast spectrum of ground and air operations to include aircraft maintenance, civil engineering, emergency response, security, and other missions. 

Air/Ground and Aircrew NVGs and BNVDs Test Set &amp; TCTO Kits includes portable instrument allowing a quick and accurate evaluation and adjustment of all goggle parameters. It uses states of the art technology and provides enhanced capabilities to the user are suitable for field operational checks and depot level NVG maintenance providing accurate checks for NVG resolution, gain, power drain, and binocular goggle collimation, image quality, and image distortion.  All NVGs require operational checkout.

   
In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), capabilities under this line item are necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and military support to civil authorities. Projected allocations for reserve component requirements are subject to total force demand priorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PEs 0207227F, 0207433F, 0408011F, 0503113F and 0702833F.

PCCIE requirements transferred from 845010 to 843040 beginning for FY20.

PE 27510F - FY 20 funds procure:

The new systems collectively satisfy critical user requirements and will:
1. Reduce overall footprint and weight by 50-60%.
2. Reduce operating and sustainment costs by 30%-50%.
3. Reduce acquisition costs as it applies to installation since many newer systems consist of more internal pre-wiring.
4. Lower parts count dramatically improves reliability by reducing the potential points of failure within the system.
5. Produce greater energy savings and higher operating efficiency in all configurations, typically between 92% and 93.5%; with all types of loads.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Mechanized Materials Handling Equipment (MMHE) line provides funding for Mechanized Materials Handling Systems (MMHS) and Storage Aids Systems (SAS). 

MMHS and SAS equipment provides bases worldwide with static and automated equipment to efficiently store, receive, and ship materiel. MMHS and SAS equipment involves the design and acquisition of mechanized and non-mechanized materials handling systems to modernize and enhance supply operations, aircraft maintenance, and air transportation.

Most MMHE is one of the following equipment types:
- Material Storage and Distribution Systems which are mechanized systems to receive, store, and ship material in a warehouse or aircraft hangar.
- Aerial Port Equipment for air transportation which includes heavy duty freight handling 463L pallet conveyors, pallet buildup/breakdown lift conveyor stations, cargo staging racks, and overhead bridge cranes for air freight terminal systems; roller conveyors and overhead cranes for aerial delivery systems; and inbound and outbound baggage conveyors and passenger boarding bridges for air passenger terminals.
- External Aircraft Fuel Tank Storage Systems which are used to store and access external aircraft fuel tanks.
- Storage Aids Systems which consist of non-mechanized equipment including racks, shelving, modular cabinets, mezzanines and mobile aisle systems.

Adequately equipped facilities are essential to the storage and handling of weapon system components and for rapid processing of personnel, freight, and baggage. Proper MMHE reduces pipeline time, reduces damage to weapon system components during handling and storage, and enhances personnel safety. MMHE provides enhanced Air Force capability to respond to crises and threats whenever they occur in the world.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207510F, 0207597F, 0502834F, and 0502844F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement funds for MMHS/SAS equipment increases the productivity of Air Force operations, enhances management control of assets, reduces multiple handling of logistics materiel by consolidating assets, enhances safety, reduces losses due to damage of materiel during storage and transport, and reduces congestion and delays in the receiving, storage and issue operations in supply, base level aircraft maintenance, and transportation facilities.  Aerial port MMHE is vital to maintain and enhance rapid deployment and sustainment capabilities.

FY21 MMHE is to be purchased in the following quantities: 6 material storage and distribution systems, 19 storage aid systems, and 6 aerial port equipment systems.</proc:Justification>

This program, Category Uncategorized Item GLOBAL STRIKE COMMAND, is a new start.

Base Procured Equipment: 

Air Force Global Strike FY21 funds are to purchase Front End Loaders (FEL) for snow removal at Minot MAFs and to purchase replacement UPS units for aging UPS supporting ICBM ops. 

PE 27142F - $1.406M  FY21 funds provide for procurement of a Deployable Debriefing Facility (DDF) which is comprised of a Lightning Modular Extendable Rigid Wall Shelter, mobile generators, Improved Environmental Control Units and ancillary equipment which can be deployed worldwide to support F-35 aircraft deployments.

PE 28015F - $2.497M  FY21 funds provide for the procurement of two engines for a missile retriever boat at Tyndall AFB. The engines have been in service over 24 years and the annual O&amp;M cost is increasing $500K per year because of increased labor to maintain the current engines. The missile retriever fleet will be unable to continue supporting retrieval of Air Force Subscale targets from the Gulf of Mexico, which creates a potential risk to them washing up on public beaches.

PE 35207F - $0.499M -  FY21 funds to procure equipment and/or specialized tools in direct support to the RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT, RC-135S COBRA BALL, and the RC-135U COMBAT SENT. 


Detailed information on the Tactical Deception program remains classified and will be provided on a need-to-know basis. For further information, please contact AF/A3TY, Mr. Phillip "Brad Snyder at (703) 697-7987. This is a new start.

PE 84701F ($300K) - FY21 funds to procure sun shades for the T-7A beddown at Randolph Air Force Base. These aircraft shelters will provide adverse weather (lightning, hail) protection for the aircraft and crew on the parking ramp. This is a new start.
 
PE 84752F - $0.698M

            <proc:Description>This program funds procurement of Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR). It includes, but is not limited to, equipment to support the bed down of deployed forces (personnel, aircraft and support equipment) at austere and semi-austere locations. BEAR assets are a critical Agile Combat Support enabler for the Expeditionary Air Force.  Prepositioned War Reserve Capabilities (PWRCs) (ashore and afloat) place military unit type equipment and supplies at or near the point of planned use to reduce reaction time and ensure timely support of a specific force during the initial phases of an operation. These assets provide combatant commanders with initial capabilities and materiel until establishment of a mature and sustained Strategic/Theater Distribution Network (TDP). (CJSCI 4310.01D)
BEAR is one of five FORCE Generation Sets (FGS) and is composed of multiple air base capability packages to include: feeding, hygiene, water production, power production, airfield lighting, shelters, aircraft arresting systems, and environmental support equipment. FGS-BEAR provides personnel, infrastructure, and flight line support at forward operating sites (Establish the Base, Operate the Base) The program provides funding to procure new and replacement equipment items, and multi-media packages required to support BEAR training facilities at Silver Flag Sites, Regional Training Sites, Technical Schools, Technical Certification Centers, Services Combat Center Training, 635MMG, and Eagle Flag. Costs include inventory reconstitution, spares and consumables, repairs, and procurement of new equipment for upgrades or full UTC's replacement. This program serves a critical role in support of the Combatant Commanders (COCOM) requirements to support 5 Major OPLANS, and ensures the objectives of the Asian Pacific Stability and European Defense Initiatives can be executed.
The AF continues to modernize major BEAR components to replace obsolete and inefficient items (e.g., Power Generation, Hygiene, Refrigeration, EALS, MAAS, Shelters, and Feeding): 

Force Module Water System: Water System takes non-potable water and converts it into potable water. The system is modular and scalable in design and consists of Source Run, Water Production, Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), Initial, Follow-on, and Industrial Operations, Flight line Extension, freeze protection, grey water recovery, pumping, piping, and storage equipment; applicable fittings; and other components such as fluid control valves. 

Power System: Consists of prime and secondary power equipment which provides the capability to generate and distribute power to billeting, feeding, flight line and industrial operations at forward deployed sites. The primary power source for BEAR bed down locations is the BEAR Power Unit (BPU). The BPU is an 800 kilowatt (kW) Tier II compliant diesel generator. The power from the BPU is distributed through buried high voltage cabling and stepped down to facility power through the Secondary Distribution Center (SDC). The SDC is a 150 kilovolt-ampere (KVA) transformer capable of supporting twelve (12) billeting shelters via the Primary Distribution Panels (PDP). 

Expeditionary Airfield Lighting System (EALS)(Legacy): Light Emitting Diode (LED) and incandescent runway lighting system designed to be rapidly installed at contingency airfields and at other locations that need temporary airfield lighting. The lighting kit for runways includes runway edge and threshold lights, precision approach path indicator (PAPI), and strobe approach lights, distance to go marker lamps, taxi way lamps and battery-operated obstruction lights. The EALS also includes the generators, cables, control cables, transformers and regulators. The entire system is packaged on six (6) mobile trailers. System will be replaced with a Next Generation System over the FYDP.

Mobile Aircraft Arresting System: This air transportable barrier arresting Bak-12 mounted on a mobile trailer to accommodate the recovery of fighter aircraft returning to battle damaged airfield. 

Hygiene: Hygiene includes Shower, Shave and Latrine, WH-400 water heaters for initial Hygiene fielding and Self Help Laundry system which provides personal hygiene facilities in support of BEAR bases. 

Shelters: Shelters vary in sizes and are needed for billeting, kitchen, hygiene, and aircraft and equipment maintenance. Includes lighting, electrical equipment, environmental control units, remote area lighting, Shelter Flies, Shelter Flooring/matting for various shelter sizes, Shelter liners. 

Feeding: BEAR Feeding includes kitchen and all applicable equipment. BEAR Feeding system provides the capability to prepare, and then serve, 500 meals over a two hour serving period, twice per day (24 hour period). The Feeding system is worldwide deployable and supports numerous basing options. This system supports initial mission requirements and follow-on high mobility feeding requirements for rapidly deployable mobility packages and other contingencies in all theaters of operation. 

Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC): provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality.

Environmental Control Unit (ECU): Heat Pump to provide cooling, heating via reversing valve (heat pump) and supplemental heat via resistance heat strips.

Training/Multi-Media Training - Provides BEAR and items for all training sites and funds for all required BEAR multi-media training requirements.

            <proc:Description>This program funds for the procurement of Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE). It provides the capability to receive, store, and issue petroleum products and support aircraft generation where fixed systems do not exist or require augmentation. FORCE is a subset of the Pre-Positioned War Reserve Capabilities (PWRC), it is a Force Generation Set (FGS) that provides mission oriented operational capability packages/force modules aligned with the air and space expeditionary task force modules described in AFI 10-401, AF Operations Planning and Execution, and this instruction. This program serves a critical role in support of the Combatant Commanders(COCOM)requirements to support 5 Major OPLANS, and ensures the objectives of the Asian Pacific Stability and European Defense Initiatives can be executed.

Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE Starter (FS), Receipt (RC)and Sustainment (SC) is a deployable modular fuel system that can provide joint capability to fuel aircraft and support equipment at forward locations.  The FORCE system can be configured to perform limited aircraft fueling missions or to sustain massive daily fueling requirements for months.  FORCE is capable of receiving, transferring, and issuing fuel at a throughput rate of 900 Gallons per Minute (GPM).  The individual pieces of equipment that comprise the FORCE system provide stand-alone or mix-and-match capability for almost any fuel transfer or aircraft refueling scenario.  The full capability mission of the complete FORCE System, when used in conjunction with fabric fuel bladders, provides a deployable, above ground, constant pressure, flow-on demand fueling system for aircraft, i.e., a hydrant-type fueling system. 

 Aerial Bulk Fuel Delivery System (ABFDS), designed for aerial delivery of fuel to locations where other methods of transportation are impractical, it enables aircraft to rapidly transport fuel to locations close to or behind enemy lines. It is the key component to the AFSOC community and their ability to complete Forward Area Refueling Point missions(FARP).

3K Collapsible Fuel Tanks (CFT) are specifically designed to be loaded on military aircraft and withstand the critical demands put on them during flight operations, in conjunction with the ABFDS they provide the ability to transfer fuel from the aircraft storage bladder while aircraft engines are running.

Collapsible Fuel Tanks (CFT) or more commonly referred to as fuel bladders provide fuel storage capabilities at austere or forward operating locations where infrastructure is either inadequate or non-existent. Bladders sizes range from 10K, 50K and 210K gallons of fuel storage, these bladders are capable of holding a multitude of petroleum products to support both air and ground operations. Collapsible fuel tanks are used with Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE) to support various aircraft systems at forward operating locations.

500 Gal LOX/Lin Tanks, are deployable liquid oxygen/liquid nitrogen storage tanks that can receive, store, and issue liquid oxygen or nitrogen products to service carts or smaller tanks.  Provides bulk storage capacity and is used to fill smaller cryogenic equipment (8 Cylinder trailers, 50 Gallon LOX Tank) and aircraft.

Fuels Pumping &amp; Distribution provides multiple capabilities to receive and deliver petroleum products to initiate and sustain ground and air operations for both expeditionary and contingency operations. Ensures the ability to service smaller aircraft such as UAV's and base support vehicles, and increases the distance that fuel loads can be safely distributed to the base up to 3 miles. 

"Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 FORCE received its first distribution of OCO funds to support the European Defense Initiative": $28.032 million was received to start the procurement of FORCE commodities required to fill the 24 Deployable Air Base Systems (DABS) needed to "Set the Theatre"

"Fiscal Year" (FY) 2019 FORCE received its second distribution of OCO funds to support the European Defense Initiative": $18,755 million was received to continue the procurement of FORCE commodities required to fill the 24 Deployable Air Base Systems (DABS) needed to "Set the Theatre

"Fiscal Year" (FY) 2020  European Defense Initiative" Funding was transitioned from OCO to Baseline (EDI): $4.0 million was received to continue the procurement of FORCE commodities required to fill the 24 Deployable Air Base Systems (DABS) needed to "Set the Theatre

"Fiscal Year" (FY) 2021  FORCE Baseline funding was reduced by $4.84 Million

Previous Fuels requirements were levied under BPAC 845990 / Base Maintenance and Support Equipment , starting in FY20 all FORCE requirements fall under BPAC 845550.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 028031F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This program provides a wide variety of base support items with worldwide application, to include but not limited to: Aircraft Arresting Systems; Aircraft Recovery Systems; Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE); Fuels Support Equipment; Base Generator Power Systems, Deployable Debrief Facilities (DDF); Flight Line Fire Extinguishers and Cargo Pallet and Net systems. This equipment provides prime support for all base missions and supports the Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program to ensure accuracy and uniformity in standards and equipment used to measure and test Air Force systems and equipment.  Accuracy is achieved by relating all measurements to national and international standards maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other recognized sources.  That relationship produces a traceability chain through a measurement hierarchy whereby base measurement standards are calibrated against Air Force primary standards, which are in turn calibrated against the national standards.  Accuracy is imperative to ensure that the weapons used by our operational forces arrive on target.  Uniformity is imperative to ensure consistency of AF systems and safety of AF operators.  Program ensures development/determination, procurement, and distribution of standards and related equipment to 65 Air Force Base PMELs residing in every Major Command (MAJCOM) worldwide and to the Air Force Primary Standards Laboratory (AFPSL). This program serves a critical role in support of Transport and Fighter Aircraft Operations across multiple operations worldwide, including but not limited to the European Deterrence Initiative, Pacific Theater, and other forward operating locations.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 will procure the following:
Fuels Support Equipment (Non-WRM): (FSE-NWRM)
FSE and FSE related items not included in the Fuels Support Equipment War Readiness Material POM (PEC 845550) that provide operational support to Air Force installations and fuels management facilities worldwide in the form of fuel storage, fuel delivery, liquid oxygen and nitrogen storage and refueling capabilities. Items include but are not limited to the Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE), Cryogenics Support (LIN/LOX), Collapsible Fuel Tanks (10K, 50K, &amp; 210K), Aerial Bulk Fuel Delivery System (ABFDS) &amp; 3K Bladders  and other required general fuels support equipment. This equipment provides prime support for all base essential missions(Non-WRM or Non-War Reserve Materiel).

Cargo Pallets and Nets:
Cargo Pallets &amp; Nets provide an expedient means of loading and unloading cargo on transport aircraft across the DoD.  Pallets &amp; Nets also secure cargo to maintain aircraft balance which is crucial to safety of flight.  661 users across the DoD rely on Pallets &amp; Nets to carry out their primary mission, through which capability and equipment are transported to all parts of the globe, enabling the execution of our National Defense Strategy.  

Small Munitions Trailers:
The Small Munitions Trailers program provides trailers (and associated accessories) capable of carrying up to 15,000 lbs of conventional munitions and up to 5,500 lbs of nuclear munitions in direct support to aircraft operations.  These trailers can carry bombs, missiles (Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground), all calibers of ammunition, all countermeasures all decoys and practice bombs.  Small Munitions Trailers directly support B-1, B-2, B-52, A-10, F-15, F16, F-22, C-5, C-17, C-130, AC-130, KC-46, KC-10 and KC-135 rated to carry munitions as cargo.  The goal of this program is to replace all legacy small munitions trailers in USAF inventory in one program effort.  The average legacy trailer has exceeded twice its 20 year service life.  The last procurement of these trailers was in 1992.  The impact of age plus wear and tear have created serious obsolescence issues and high overhaul repair costs.  Currently, the cost to complete a depot overhaul of a legacy trailer is nearly twice the estimated procurement cost of a new trailer.  

Lack of funding for these equipment items limits  flight operations, maintenance capabilities, testing functions, anti-terrorism/security missions, communications capabilities, and the ability of Air Force units to meet peacetime and deployment requirements. 

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. 

Program elements associated with this P-1 Line are: 0702207F, 0202834F, 0207142F, 0208031F, 0208530F, 0402834F, 0502834F, 0502844F, 0702834F, 0802834F, 0804741F.

FY 2021 procurement dollars will procure support equipment items, Program Management Administration (PMA), and other government associated costs in support of base and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

CY 2021 funding totals include $30.65M in Overseas Contingency Operations. 
PY 2020 funding totals include $20.067M for OCO.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>RC-135 procurement is executed by the Big Safari RC-135 Program Manager and is supported by various contractors.  The contractors provide services including Program Depot Maintenance (PDM), prime mission equipment overhaul, special repair activity, in-plant support (sustainment engineering, software engineering, and program management), configuration management, LRU repair, and field service maintenance and training for special operational missions.  The RC-135 Program Manager provides the full-range of weapons system management, acquisition oversight, program security and integrated logistics for the RC-135 aircraft, power plant, sensors and associated support and equipment.  Due to the rapidly changing global threat environment, the Program Manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander and Intelligence Community (IC) requirements.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0305207F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY21 procurement funding acquires and installs various upgrade and enhancement modifications for ground support equipment associated with the RC-135 program.  This ground support equipment is directly tied to fielded baselines of the RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT, RC-135S COBRA BALL, and the RC-135U COMBAT SENT.  The requirement to maintain commonality with fielded baselines necessitates the continuous modification and installation of upgrades concurrent with RC-135 aircraft entering operational status.  These ground systems are critical to the post-mission processing of highly perishable intelligence information, and supporting aircrew proficiency training, virtual simulation exercises that contribute to distributed mission training initiatives, and provide support to indigenous maintenance during aircraft deployments to "bare-base locations.  Additionally, all applicable ground support equipment is required to comply with NSA intelligence data recording formats and requirements due to the nature and sensitivity of the information.

Congressional adds in FY20 added $25.063M of OPAF to replace equipment destroyed during the March 2019 flood at Offutt AFB, NE.

Ground support equipment includes, but is not limited to: RIVET JOINT Mission Trainer (RJMT), Ground Data Processing System (GDPS), Mission Crew Training System (MCTS), Modular Processing System (MPS), and the Airborne Capability Extension System (ACES).</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>RC-135 procurement is executed by the Big Safari RC-135 Program Manager and is supported by various contractors.  The contractors provide services including Program Depot Maintenance (PDM), prime mission equipment overhaul, special repair activity, in-plant support (sustainment engineering, software engineering, and program management), configuration management, LRU repair, and field service maintenance and training for special operational missions.  The RC-135 Program Manager provides the full-range of weapons system management, acquisition oversight, program security and integrated logistics for the RC-135 aircraft, power plant, sensors and associated support and equipment.  Due to the rapidly changing global threat environment, the Program Manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander and Intelligence Community (IC) requirements.

FY21 procurement funding acquires and installs various upgrade and enhancement modifications for ground support equipment associated with the RC-135 program.  This ground support equipment is directly tied to fielded baselines of the RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT, RC-135S COBRA BALL, and the RC-135U COMBAT SENT.  The requirement to maintain commonality with fielded baselines necessitates the continuous modification and installation of upgrades concurrent with RC-135 aircraft entering operational status.  These ground systems are critical to the post-mission processing of highly perishable intelligence information, supporting aircrew proficiency training, virtual simulation exercises that contribute to distributed mission training initiatives, and provide support to indigenous maintenance during aircraft deployments to "bare-base locations.  Additionally, all applicable ground support equipment is required to comply with NSA intelligence data recording formats and requirements due to the nature and sensitivity of the information.

Congressional adds in FY20 added $25.063M of OPAF to replace equipment destroyed during the March 2019 flood at Offutt AFB, NE.

Ground support equipment includes, but is not limited to:  RIVET JOINT Mission Trainer (RJMT), Ground Data Processing System (GDPS), Mission Crew Training System (MCTS), Modular Processing System (MPS), and the Airborne Capability Extension System (ACES).

            <proc:Description>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT, federated weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites and other collection systems.  

AF DCGS is designed to support Joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements and supports the "kill chain across the full range of military operations. Currently, AF DCGS is composed of eight core sites (two active duty worldwide, three active duty regional and three Air National Guard regional), three remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, six SIGINT Distributed Mission Sites (four collocated with National Mission Partner), three Air National Guard full-motion video sites, three support sites, three training sites, and three integration and test sites. AF DCGS currently supports ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS-based locations. AF DCGS provides integrated ISR by providing quality, fused Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.

In alignment with DoD and AF direction, AF DCGS is migrating to an open architecture to rapidly incorporate new technologies and tools to easily integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as provide improved mission applications to meet emerging and urgent operational needs. AF DCGS integrates services and applications from both commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf sources to the maximum extent possible to fulfill operational requirements and data sharing requirements across the DoD DCGS community.   The next iteration will involve transitioning to a hybrid cloud (mix of private on premise and public cloud) architecture.

Program management consists of five ACAT III efforts: GEOINT Transformation, SIGINT Transformation, Multi-INT, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT)

1. GEOINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new GEOINT capabilities, enables quick/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, and command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.

2. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new SIGINT capabilities, enables quick/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates SIGINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.

3. Multi-INT-1: Rapidly integrates new and updated enterprise applications, to include voice/video/chat communications, collaboration and situational awareness, multi-INT fusion, and data analytics capabilities into the open architecture framework.  Also includes Intelligent Modeling and Predictive Analysis of Cyberspace Targeting (IMPACT) program, which develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing ISR and non-kinetic capabilities.  Addressees program office test and evaluation activities.

4. Network Infrastructure Transformation: Modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, commercial-based, architecture, improving data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery. OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture and public cloud represents the AF DCGS hybrid cloud (mix of private on premise and public cloud) architecture.

5. *DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.

NOTES:
*No additional funding planned in FY20 or out years; ACAT will be closed once the capability is installed at all sites

AF DCGS's GEOINT program's main focus is the procurement and fielding of proven technologies for multiple programs including GEOINT Transformation. The GEOINT Transformation leverages an agile infrastructure to use modern information technology (IT) practices and sets the stage from which to accomplish the goals of the AF DCGS architecture roadmap in manageable increments. GEOINT Transformation builds on the GB4.1 foundation to provide enhanced front-end image processing and advanced exploitation tools, which improve the timeliness and quality of GEOINT products, making them more useful to the war-fighter while simultaneously reducing the workload on the DCGS operator.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new SIGINT capabilities, enables quick/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, command and control (C2) capabilities and migrates SIGINT-specific applications into the open architecture framework. Leverages mission partner methods and tools to the maximum extent possible.

Justification:
AF DCGS SIGINT Transformation's main focus is AF DCGS peering connectivity to our National Mission Partner network. In order to accomplish this, SIGINT modernization must take place within the OA DCGS environment. This includes development of windows-based SIGINT application software and decoupling of the legacy SIGINT software baseline to take advantage of open architecture infrastructure and enterprise services.  Efforts also implement infrastructure changes required to ensure compatibility and access to mission partner tools.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>Multi-INT-1: Rapidly integrates new and updated enterprise applications, to include voice/video/chat communications, collaboration and situational awareness, multi-INT fusion, and data analytics capabilities into the open architecture framework.  Also includes Intelligent Modeling and Predictive Analysis of Cyberspace Targeting (IMPACT) program, which develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing ISR and non-kinetic capabilities.  Addressees program office test and evaluation activities.

Justification:
This effort continues to deliver new/modernized Multi-INT capabilities to the operator, and addresses any other issues that are identified with other legacy systems/components that AF DCGS must interface with.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>Network Infrastructure Transformation: Modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, commercial-based, architecture, improving data ingest, transfer and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery. OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture and public cloud represents the AF DCGS hybrid cloud (mix of private on premise and public cloud) architecture.

Justification:
AF DCGS's Network Infrastructure Transformation program's main focus is the procurement and fielding of proven open, scalable infrastructure backbone, technologies for network communications, centralized storage of analyst produced multi-INT intelligence products, communication modernization, demilitarized zone, weapon system trainer, and addresses diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) weapons system issues. This program will continue to deliver an integrated net-centric upgrade to the network communications infrastructure and address any other DMS issues with legacy systems/components that AF DCGS must interoperate/interface with.  Additionally, upgrades will meet the operational need to store and disseminate new and/or improved sensor data, and enhance interoperability by migrating to an open architecture construct and improving data sharing ability in compliance with DoD direction.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

Initial Spares consist of reparable components, assemblies, subassemblies, and consumable items required as initial stock (including readiness spares package requirements) in support of newly fielded vehicles, communications electronics and telecommunications equipment, and other base maintenance and support equipment items.  Requirements are determined by applying established factors against the acquisition cost of the end items.  The factors are based on historical data of similar equipment, employment/deployment concepts, production schedules, and other related information.

The following Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) has funding in this line:</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>ATCALS:  FY21 funding ($1.451M) is required to support the Digital Air Traffic Control Radio ($994K) and the Fixed Base Precision Approach Radar ($457K) programs.  Required initial spares are a combination of complete assemblies, subassemblies, or in special circumstances piece-part items.  Selection is based on the Interim Support Items List, historical data from similar systems or components, and/or sparing models and are sized to ensure system availability requirements are met.  

Combat Training Range Equipment:  FY21 funds ($8.250M) spare parts and equipment to support fielding of Joint Threat Emitters and Advanced Radar Threat System Variant 2. Spares include replacement components, equipment and parts.

Expeditionary Airfield Basing Assets:  FY21 funds (2.268) mission readiness support kits for War Reserve Material (WRM) Unit Type Codes (UTC). These support kits include necessary components to ensure proper operation of equipment within UTC package. These UTC kits packages, but are not limited to, Power Production, Feeding, Water Production, Billeting, Maintenance Facilities, and HVAC. Also, mission essential spare parts are procured utilizing this funding.

Expeditionary Airfield Basing Assets:  FY21 European Defense Initiative (EDI) OCO funds (4.000) mission readiness support kits for War Reserve Material (WRM) Unit Type Codes (UTC). These support kits include necessary components to ensure proper operation of equipment within UTC package. These UTC kits packages, but are not limited to, Power Production, Feeding, Water Production, Billeting, Maintenance Facilities, and HVAC. Also, mission essential spare parts are procured utilizing this funding.

Information Systems Security Program (ISSP):  Starting in FY21 funding for PE 0303140F, Information Systems Security Program (ISSP)Initial Spares moved from 861900 to 861350.

Minimum Essential Emergency Comm Network (MEECN):  FY20 funding (68.795) is required to support Global ASNT Increment 1 fixed and transportable terminals to meet the high threshold Operational Availability (Ao) Key Performance Parameter (KPP) outlined in the Global ASNT Capability Development Document (CDD).  These spares need to be procured at the same time as production terminals in order to support terminal fielding.  Additionally, this program has overarching diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) requirements and will use procurement funding to address these requirements.

Wide Area Surveillance (WAS):  FY21 funding ($1.904) is required to support operational WAS Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) sites.  These spares and repair parts are uniquely site-specific, critical items required to be completed while the initial manufacturing line is set up for each individual fielding location.

Deployable C3: FY21 funding ($1.986M) is required to support initial spares for the Flexible Communications Package(FCP) being incorporated into the Joint Task Force (JTF).  These spares and repair parts are unique and critical items required to be available for each individual fielding location.</proc:Justification>

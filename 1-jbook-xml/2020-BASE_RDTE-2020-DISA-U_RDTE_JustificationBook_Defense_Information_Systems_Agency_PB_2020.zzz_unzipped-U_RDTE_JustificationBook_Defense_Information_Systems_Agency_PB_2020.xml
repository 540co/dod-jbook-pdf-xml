            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System - Joint (GCSS-J), is a key enabler for achieving Focused Logistics and is essential during peace, contingency, crisis, and war in support of the joint warfighter across the full range of military operations. GCSS-J, the Logistics System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture to ensure the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to mobilize, move, and sustain all elements of operating forces within a theater or operational area. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide a fused, integrated, near real-time, multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., supply, deployment and distribution, engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports. GCSS-J provides real time actionable information in the form of watchboards (e.g., fuels and munitions watchboards) and near real time information in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The decrease of -$5.024 from 2017 to FY 2018 reduces Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture (LogCOP) support to the logisticians as they plan, execute, control, and assess in an increasingly complex global environment.  Additionally, the decrease reduces the overall pace and scope of GCSS development efforts to meet Joint Staff logistics operational needs. Part of the overall decrease (-$0.274) is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GCSS-J Program Management Office (PMO) uses various contract types, employs large and small businesses, and is focused on achieving agency socio-economic goals and incorporating DoD acquisition reform initiatives in purchasing. The PMO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews, monthly Contract Performance Reviews, and bi-monthly In-Process Reviews.  

The PMO uses a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for development efforts rather than the traditional Statement of Work, as it provides potential offerors flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet GCSS-J requirements. By stating the requirements in a SOO, the contractor can produce a technical solution methodology to deliver leading edge technology to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>GCSS-J fields capabilities based on functional priorities of the Combatant Command 129 Requirements Document as approved and prioritized by the functional sponsor, Joint Staff J4. These requirements and goals are translated into releases with specific capabilities, which have established cost, schedule, and performance parameters approved by the DISA's Component Acquisition Executive/Milestone Decision Authority.

Metrics and requirements are routinely gathered by the GCSS-J PMO. The metrics from the strategic server sites are analyzed by the PMO to ensure that operational mission threads continue to be met and if system enhancement/capabilities are benefiting the user. Future capabilities include tools that allow GCSS-J to refine and enhance the type of performance metrics that can be gathered and analyzed. These tools become increasingly important as GCSS-J continues to integrate additional data sources and external applications, which allows GCSS-J to continue to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture and directly supports DoD's net-centric vision of exposing and consuming web services. As GCSS-J usage increases and new capabilities are fielded, performance metrics will ensure that the system is meeting user requirements.

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$0.804 in FY 2018 is due to the amount of -$0.652 showing under BA07 PE 0903235K Joint Service Provider (JSP), but are for this same effort.  Funds have since been corrected and moved to this BA06 PE for proper execution, but not in time for yearend lock. Total for FY 2018 should now be $4.961). The decrease amount of -$0.152 is for the transfer to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.

The decrease of -$2.000 in FY 2020 is attributed to a realignment of funding from RDT&amp;E to the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) appropriation to fund sustainment efforts for the Defensive Cyber Insider Threat - User Activity Monitoring (UAM) initiative.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The JAIC was established to preserve and expand our military advantage in support of the Department’s 2018 National Defense Strategy. As a primarily executing body it will accelerate the delivery of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled capabilities, scale the Department-wide impact of AI, and synchronize DoD AI activities to expand Joint Force advantages.  The JAIC mission is to accelerate the delivery of AI to achieve impact scaled across the DoD at relevant speed to transform the DoD and ensure the nation maintains a competitive advantage.  JAIC capitalizes on Project Maven’s efforts as the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD to further critical AI architecture and prototyping to rapidly expand AI to other mission areas. As JAIC efforts prove relevant, they will expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use, and increase Joint Force capability.  Most military data storage, utilization, and analytic tools and systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. JAIC capabilities are commercial technology initiatives that insert commercial AI into existing programs of record. 

JAIC will execute an initial sequence of cross-functional use cases to demonstrate value and create momentum, called National Mission Initiatives (NMI). NMIs will rapidly develop and deploy AI across the Joint Force for selected high-priority, pressing operational or business reform challenges. Additionally, JAIC will work closely with individual components to help identify, shape, and accelerate component-specific AI deployments, called Component Mission Initiatives (CMI). Both NMI and CMI efforts will include selecting commercial and academic partners for prototypes, and develop standardized processes with respect to data, testing and evaluation, and cybersecurity. JAIC will use lessons learned from these initial projects to establish new processes and standards that will be repeatable across additional projects and immediately relevant to the Joint Force. This will be done in collaboration with partners across technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), services, and international partners.

To support the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the JAIC will catalyze and develop AI capabilities to enhance readiness and lethality and ensure DoD maintains an advantage over adversaries.  JAIC will spearhead this unique opportunity to expand the competitive space across all domains with AI. JAIC efforts will directly contribute to increased military readiness towards a more lethal Joint Force, it will strengthen alliances and attract new partners by focusing on global problems, and it will enable Departmental reform to increase performance and affordability.  JAIC will cultivate workforce talent by recruiting, developing, and retaining high-quality personnel to enable the development and delivery of AI.  This will bring critical skills into the department by drawing outside expertise, and leveraging small companies, start-ups, and universities.  Implementing AI at a speed of relevance hinges on the ability to integrate AI better than our adversaries, and the JAIC will enable the Department to adapt AI into how it fights. JAIC will focus on speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and frequent capability delivery sprints. To fully realize this potential, the JAIC will pioneer AI approaches across the full scale of the global enterprise in a manner that is jointly interoperable with allies, partners, military Services, and agencies. Specifically, JAIC will identify and implement new organizational approaches, establish key AI building blocks and standards, develop and attract AI talent, and introduce new operational models that will enable DoD to systematically take advantage of AI at enterprise scale. The JAIC will fulfill the National Security Strategy and NDS to ensure conventional overmatch through dual-use commercial technology and partnered DoD-developed AI. The JAIC will collaborate with non-governmental organizations, corporations, strategic influencers, and partners and allies. JAIC will seize the initiative to lead the world in the development and adoption of transformative defense AI solutions that are safe, ethical, and secure. JAIC will spearhead this effort, engaging with the best minds in government, the private sector, academia, and international community.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JAIC capitalizes on Project Maven’s efforts as the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD to further critical AI architecture and prototyping to rapidly expand AI to other mission areas. As JAIC efforts prove relevant, they will expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use, and increase Joint Force capability.  Most military data storage, utilization, and analytic tools and systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. JAIC capabilities are commercial technology initiatives that insert commercial AI into existing programs of record. 

JAIC will execute an initial sequence of cross-functional use cases to demonstrate value and create momentum, called National Mission Initiatives (NMI). NMIs will rapidly develop and deploy AI across the Joint Force for selected high-priority, pressing operational or business reform challenges. Additionally, JAIC will work closely with individual components to help identify, shape, and accelerate component-specific AI deployments, called Component Mission Initiatives (CMI). Both NMI and CMI efforts will include selecting commercial and academic partners for prototypes, and develop standardized processes with respect to data, testing and evaluation, and cybersecurity. JAIC will use lessons learned from these initial projects to establish new processes and standards that will be repeatable across additional projects and immediately relevant to the Joint Force. This will be done in collaboration with partners across technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), services, and international partners.

To support the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the JAIC will catalyze and develop AI capabilities to enhance readiness and lethality and ensure DoD maintains an advantage over adversaries.  JAIC will spearhead this unique opportunity to expand the competitive space across all domains with AI. JAIC efforts will directly contribute to increased military readiness towards a more lethal Joint Force, it will strengthen alliances and attract new partners by focusing on global problems, and it will enable Departmental reform to increase performance and affordability.  JAIC will cultivate workforce talent by recruiting, developing, and retaining high-quality personnel to enable the development and delivery of AI.  This will bring critical skills into the department by drawing outside expertise, and leveraging small companies, start-ups, and universities.  Implementing AI at a speed of relevance hinges on the ability to integrate AI better than our adversaries, and the JAIC will enable the Department to adapt AI into how it fights. JAIC will focus on speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and frequent capability delivery sprints. To fully realize this potential, the JAIC will pioneer AI approaches across the full scale of the global enterprise in a manner that is jointly interoperable with allies, partners, military Services, and agencies. Specifically, JAIC will identify and implement new organizational approaches, establish key AI building blocks and standards, develop and attract AI talent, and introduce new operational models that will enable DoD to systematically take advantage of AI at enterprise scale. The JAIC will fulfill the National Security Strategy and NDS to ensure conventional overmatch through dual-use commercial technology and partnered DoD-developed AI. The JAIC will collaborate with non-governmental organizations, corporations, strategic influencers, and partners and allies. JAIC will seize the initiative to lead the world in the development and adoption of transformative defense AI solutions that are safe, ethical, and secure. JAIC will spearhead this effort, engaging with the best minds in government, the private sector, academia, and international community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>JAIC will build a new NMI, Cyber Sense-making.  The new NMI will provide artificial intelligence to the Cyber Mission Force to enable enterprise-scale sensemaking for cyberspace operations. Advanced adversarial Cyber actors infiltrate and operate undetected within the DoD Information Network (DODIN). Operating numerous disparate tools and processing the avalanche of data exceeds human cognitive ability for warfighters to detect and understand adversary activity. This hinders military operations, diminishes the security posture of the DODIN, and potentially compromises national strategic assets.  Cyberspace operators and security professionals rely on static signature and rule based techniques combined with manual data correlation processes to detect known threats in the DODIN. They leverage disparate commercial and open source software to enumerate friendly Cyber terrain resulting in a myopic view of the Cyber environment. Due to the dynamic, contested, and congested nature of the DODIN, these capabilities fail to adequately integrate information to provide a Cyberspace Common Operating Picture. Currently, the Cyber Mission Force requires significant man-hours to manage, with varying degrees of success: detect advanced cyber threats in real time, identify adversarial use of compromised accounts, identify novel threat activity, and categorize user behavior trends and anomalies to detect adversary use of compromised accounts. Additionally, overall NMI efforts will augment current network mapping tools to accelerate and enrich Cyber terrain enumeration and improve situational awareness. Finally, this NMI will increase automation in malware and event detection/response to improve human sensing and optimize decision making to apply human judgement where it is most needed and apply machines to do repetitive analysis.

Rapid prototyping models will be developed to detect adversary use of compromised accounts; to understand the DODIN networks and system malware/event detections; and to enhance network mapping. These actions will decrease the time and human effort it currently takes to conduct such cyber efforts, while increasing the accuracy and effectiveness of such efforts at the speed of machine computing. It will return the cognitive bandwidth of cyber defense operators and allow them to better maintain awareness of, and exercise judgement in the cyber realm. This NMI will increase DODIN security, safeguard sensitive information, and give crucial time back to decision makers who can focus on strategic analysis and response, rather than making sense of adversaries’ actions and deterring them.</r2:Text>

• Time – Enable the warfighter to execute processes faster than current capabilities allow. This includes the ability to process more, or higher levels of relevant knowledge and apply human cognitive capital to higher order judgments on a faster pace than previously capable.
• Money – Enable the warfighter to reduce duplication of effort and to prepare and execute events at a more effective and efficient cost than current capabilities allow. This includes finding efficiencies in system lifecycle management, supply chain, replacement and repair, and more accurate requisitions, saving critical limited fiscal resources to be applied appropriately.
• Realism – Enable the warfighter to create an environment that is closer to the real world environment than current capabilities allow.
• Fidelity – Ensure unity of effort throughout the Department and external stakeholders for national imperative focus areas, while catalyzing and accelerating AI capabilities beyond what was previously projected to be accomplished during that time period.
• Transition – Select projects that have the greatest likelihood of adoption and transition to operational capabilities.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$0.928 in FY 2018 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs and -$0.327 is for the reduction costs by employing automation technologies to include cloud services to conduct testing and data analysis in the operational environment.  

The increase of +$3.048 in FY 2020 will provide additional infrastructure, network bandwidth and instrumentation to support development and testing of enterprise systems and Cyber capabilities in a replicated DODIN environment (+$2.748).  This increase is offset by a reduction required to offset civilian personnel requirements for departmental priorities and a transfer of 2 FTEs to the DISA Working Capital Fund in support of the Fourth Estate IT Optimization.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), manages the Department’s Interoperability Test, Evaluation, and Certification process that is structured to provide meaningful and independent test results in order to increase stakeholder confidence.  The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities, are to validate that DISA’s (and the Department’s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&amp;E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA’s T&amp;E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA’s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&amp;E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. 

As the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: 
  •  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.
  •  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical Data systems.
  •  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. 
  •  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.
  •  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD’s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT/NSS). 
  •  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

JITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: 
  •  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  
  •  Conducting assessments during one of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).
  •  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. 
  •  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. 
  •  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).
  •  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
  •  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. 
 
As the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.

JITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) events to determine if IT/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  

JITC focuses its efforts towards core T&amp;E improvements, better T&amp;E policy for IT/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.

The T&amp;E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA’s MRTFB each year are to:  
  •  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.
  •  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. 
  •  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&amp;E on changing or emerging technologies. 
  •  Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As the only non-Service activity of the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) provides the only dedicated Information Technology (IT) environment investing in a single end-to-end infrastructure for testing the Enterprise Edge to the Tactical Edge.  As an MRTFB, Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) provides tested IT infrastructure products to the DoD, Federal/non-Federal Government, Commercial vendors, and Allied partners.  

The DISA MRTFB infrastructure:

  •  Encompasses two geographic locations (Ft. Huachuca, AZ; Ft. Meade, MD). 

  •  116K square feet of raised floor space comprised of multiple test environments and test networks supporting over 100 programs on an annual basis.
  
  •  Complies with multiple levels of security and is scaled to support approximately 1,000 annual testing events to evaluate the DoD's converged information environment, Cyber, Cloud services, Mobility, and National Security Systems (NSS).

  •  Encompasses a significant portfolio of reference implementations, test tools, and supporting IT systems to aid both test execution and data collection/analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration between United States (US) forces, trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  The MNIS program supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with over 80,000 users worldwide.  MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability.  The integration of new technology for CENTRIXS and Pegasus is accomplished through research, integration, and testing using the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network.  

A planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), will provide distinct and permanent transport capabilities; enabling network operation centers to prioritize command and control information more efficiently.  CMNT supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance for integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.  This capability provides a common transport for encrypted traffic.  CMNT will be the established encrypted network to facilitate the movement of virtual private network traffic between segments.

The MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Services (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners providing enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with US Government agencies and non-traditional partners such as, host nations, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The employment concept for the UISS is to implement enterprise Web-based, “non-mil” platform, available to as broad a community as needed to support mission operations, with worldwide, 24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week access, to any user with an Internet connection, including web-enabled mobile personal devices.  Using an Internet-based capability and an integrated suite of commercial-off-the-shelf collaboration tools the UISS capability will enable unclassified information exchanges and ad-hoc communications for shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program is a portfolio of four coalition information sharing capabilities designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence information among United States (US) forces and multinational partners.

1) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), supports intelligence and classified operations at the Secret Releasable level.  There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks/COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  

2) Pegasus connects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the US, using commercial-off-the-shelf security appliances and cross domain solutions that facilitate situational awareness and operational planning/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. 

3) The Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing “sandbox” for the US, CCEB Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other mission essential nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  CFBLNet's direct customers are the CCEB nations’ military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the COCOM and Agency levels.  It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance community to test capabilities prior to deployment.

4) The Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS) extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners, enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with other US Government agencies, host nations, inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Will continue to engineering and integrate the modernization of NMCS capabilities (e.g. transition platforms, data interfaces, security and graphical user interfaces)  as the NMCS Systems Engineer IAW CJCSI 3280 and CJCSI 5119.  Will focus on the improvement of collaborative services, and the integration of new transport mediums that facilitate C3 services. Integrate applicable portions of the NMCS into the National Leadership Commmand Capability (NLCC) portfolio.

The increase of +$1.288 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to application of the NLCC Configuration Management process to applicable NMCS systems and to provide engineering support for Northstar and SATSTAR services transition to new NLCC transport infrastructure. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.079 attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>During FY2018 a full and open competition will be conducted for an NLCC Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract to provided programmed support to Joint System Engineering and Integration Office (JSEIO) in FY2018 as follow-on to the previous contract with Raytheon, Arlington, VA.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The JSEIO conducts regularly scheduled In-progress Program Reviews (IPRs) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings to monitor status of engineering projects/tasks. Each current project/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized. Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.

The NMCS is on track to and met its FY 2018 metrics by delivering suitable products on schedule and within allocated resources 100% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Infrastructure Engineering and Integration effort encompasses two projects: Modeling and Simulation and DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support. There are two major activities under the Modeling and Simulation project: Modeling and Simulation and DODIN Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE).

The DODIN EWSE activity resolves near term (one to three years) high-priority technical issues defined by DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), that impact operational capabilities affecting DODIN End-to-End (E2E) interoperability and performance. 

The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.

The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support project performs discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technologies through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to fill capability shortfalls and technology gaps across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).   The OCTO identifies these gaps/shortfalls, pursues leading innovative solutions from industry, academia, and the Federal sector, and engages industry partners for commercial best practices.  The OCTO Develops technology forecasts and innovation roadmaps for existing and nascent DISA Programs in the following areas:  Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, Communication (DODIN/Mobile/End-User Devices).   The OCTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight of DISA and DoD enterprise products and services.  The OCTO performs early identification of technology needs and explores, develops, and delivers recommended emerging technologies to the DISA Requirements &amp; Analysis Office.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease in FY 2018 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs (-$0.634) and due to completion of the major phases of two projects, QUICKWIN and LIFI.  QUICKWIN delivered tablets with the same DISANet office automation solution, functionality, and security as DISANet laptops, including implementation of the DoD PKI Purebred derived credential concept instead of CAC cards, with key attestation and root of trust (RoT) (-$0.871).  

The decrease in FY 2019 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs (-$0.440).

The increase of +$0.079 in FY 2020 is due to the expansion of technical system engineering reviews and oversight of DISA and DoD enterprise products and services for Return on Investment (ROI) analysis, analysis of alternatives, and mission partner support.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>EWSE uses contractors to assist/supplement the Government lead/team for technical activities. Subject matter experts in both large and small businesses are sought for the engineering support. Firm fixed price contracts with one option year are typically used in open competition. Furthermore, technical work with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) such as MITRE and MIT Lincoln Lab are established and coordinated when the Government can leverage their expertise and R&amp;D in the key technology.  

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects. Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). FFRDCs are also considered depending upon the task.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support project aligns with the updated DISA Strategic Plan, which includes the Chief Technology Officer’s Outlook and a Technology Watchlist. The Watchlist identifies key technology areas that are essential for Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) including:  Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, and Communication (DODIN, Mobile/End-User Devices).   

The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support Project ensure the technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) are in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and the latest Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO) Capabilities Planning Guidance (CPG) through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These strategies will establish the foundation for DISA's technology investments and technical development. The OCTO leverages emerging technology to drive efficiencies and cost savings to the DoD, the Warfighter, and other Federal Agencies, and provides actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.

Cyber security and cloud computing present critical near term challenges, especially the ability to securely leverage commercial cloud service offerings. The OCTO’s partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions. Included are applications with a security wrapper that detect and mitigate cyberattacks; smart routing and managed reputation capability; embedded system defense capabilities; and resilient and intrusion-tolerant network capabilities.

Partnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services. The OCTO will conduct technology assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DODIN architecture and standards. Enabled by the Technology Assessment Framework (TAF) and the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR), the OCTO will perform “quick looks” and deeper technology evaluations to provide critical awareness, characterization, and suitability of specific technologies. These include the assessments of advanced cloud management capabilities; physical containers to enable mobile data center; emerging open source Storage Service Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and/or abstractions and global standards for storage services; analytic platform performance baselines of emerging commercial analytic platform products; advanced approaches to Continuity of Operations (COOP) in a hybrid cloud environment; and the next generation software defined networks for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.  The Agency's internal innovation suggestion program, DISAruptive, previously resourced by available government civilian time, will be revamped in FY2019 with relaunch by FY20 to deliver technical expertise and including training for potential innovators and innovation suggestion technical support including limited test conduct, instrumentation, or test materials.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The CTO will expand its focus on laboratory prototyping known as Software Defined Everything (SDE) which is based on the notion of using software to keep redefining itself, rather than being locked into operating in a specific way.  It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler to leverage capabilities from five principal areas. These five areas are; Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, Communication (DoDIN, Mobile/End-User Devices).   CTO will conduct technical assessments for future cloud computing technologies and innovative service delivery models, mobile devices, application development and vetting best practices, and next generation virtualized Software Defined Networks (SDN) for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.   CTO will partner with commercial partners, academia, technical analysis centers, as well as organizations within the Intelligence Community, to bring state of the art capabilities to the DISA/DoD resulting in better communications and monitoring tools, enterprise services and improved end-user services and capabilities.  CTO will continue to pursue and refine methods, processes and strategies to assist in the acceleration of capability into the operational environment.                  

There is a increase of +$1.771 from FY 2017 to FY 2018.  Funding will be used to morph to an internet 2.0 environment where DoD, other government organizations, coalition members, first responders, private industry, academia and commercial vendors will be able to share secured data and information in such a way that adversaries can be identified, found, brought to Justice before inflicting harm on innocent citizens and allies anywhere in the world.  CTO will aggressively pursue next generation technologies to feed the internet 2.0 environment.  These technologies will be leveraged through the expansion of a CTO futuristic Skunk Works effort known as Software Defined Everything (SDE) which is based on the notion of using software to keep redefining itself, rather than being locked into operating in a specific way.  It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler for the internet 2.0 environment. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.276 is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Federal Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Number of Technology Assessments 

Performance is measured by the number of technologies assessed and the technologies transitioned or presented to DISA decision-making bodies such as the Service Portfolio Council (SPC) for acquisition decisions.  The assessments identify, promote, channel and align technology research and investments.  The objectives are to satisfy warfighter requirements by addressing capability gaps, to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency, and to reduce the time needed to field emerging technologies.   

Measure/Goal:   Number of technology assessments instantiated within the CTO Technology Environment.  Number of research initiatives designed, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned or presented to DISA decision-making bodies such as the SPC for acquisition decisions.

FY 2018 Target:  12 Assessed and 8 transitioned / Actual: 12 Assessed and 8 transitioned.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defenses (DoD's) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) (formerly known as National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes engineering for Networking capabilities and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.

PNVC:  The PVNC provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military, satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   
 
DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Increase in FY 2018 of +$7.662 IS due to the increase to PNVC for radiation and survivable testing requirements for airborne version of the baseband interface group crypto, integration, security and software updates (+$6.416) and an increase of +$2.486 to fund Milestone 4 &amp; 5 of Assured Identity which supports prototype demonstration and assigned attributes (dedicated Security, device attestation, pilot device configuration &amp; purebred application enhancements) for granting mobile access to DoD mission critical information and information sharing systems.  These increases were offset by a decrease of -$1.190 which reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs and a congressional general reduction for Federally Funded Research &amp; Development Centers (FFRDC) of -$0.050.   

Decrease in FY 2019 of -$0.416 is due to the congressional general reduction Federally Funded Research &amp; Development Centers (FFRDC). 

Decrease in FY 2020 of -$3.008 due primarily to the functional transfer of PNVC to the Air Force.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The audio equipment development activities are incorporated into the sole source DRSN sustainment contract.  For the development of the Baseband Interface Group (BIG) cryptographic device, NSA will perform an assisted acquisition for DISA using a competitively awarded fixed price contract. Engineering support for PNVC is provided by task orders competitively awarded on existing DoD contracts and Federally Funded Research and Development Contracts (FFRDC) support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>PNVC project metrics track the development status of program acquisition documents, as required by the component executive. These documents include:  Project Execution Plan, Concept of Operations Acquisition Strategy, Capability Production Document, System Engineering Plan and other documents required by the DISA’s Component Acquisition Executive.  Additionally, for management and system engineering support vendors, monthly reports are critical to tracking overall programmatic and engineering progress and the percent of total deliverables received on time.

For product development activities, effective progress is measured based upon the task order milestones in the form of development reviews and weekly progress meetings.  As end items (hardware and software) become available for test, additional measures will be available.  Specifically, the percentage of successfully verified requirements out of the number tested and the number of critical trouble reports outstanding longer than six months, will be tracked.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DISN Systems Engineering Support project encompasses four activities:

Next Generation Networking Technologies (formally known as Internet Protocol (IP) and Optical Transport Technology Refresh):  Provides engineering technical expertise to support and integrate newer, more efficient technologies required to replace end of lifecycle equipment and to achieve more efficient Networking technologies.  These new technologies provide protected and assured services for critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.	
																								
Element Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).																			
																			
Peripheral and Component Design (Secure Voice Switches):  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multi-level security (i.e., extensive conferencing/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  

DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Engineer with plans and procedures, systems analysis, operational assessments, systems engineering, and development of concepts of operation and architectures. The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war. MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the mission of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Systems Engineer to the Joint Staff and Executive Leadership. It also provides NC3 expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office. Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provide the sole means for verification of NC3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Will continue to identify NLCC capability gaps, and develop engineering courses of action to close those gaps. Will continue to shape plans for future NLCC capabilities, perform end-to-end testing of fielded capabilities, and perform operational assessments of current capabilities to provide quantitative measures of ongoing system performance and operational efficiency. Will continue to develop the NLCC Reference Architecture, its associated NLCC Roadmap, and the technical architecture patterns that will guide future solution architecture development. 

The decrease of +$1.942 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to reduced number of technical assessments required, expansion of the production of architectural artifacts required to complete the NLCC Technical Architecture; development of a NLCC Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability; support engineering and implementation of the NLCC enterprise mobility infrastructure. Part of the overall increase (-$0.297) is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is measured by compliance with contract deliverables schedules for specifically included products, such as: operational assessment plans, operational assessment reports; recommended revisions to the Joint Staff’s Emergency Action Procedures (EAP-CJCS) Volumes VI and VII; updates to NC3 System Description documents and Nuclear C3 Architecture Diagrams. In addition, performance of the NC3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element. These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of Nuclear command and control: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management. Performance of the SLC3S-Airborne fleet is measured by the technical assessment results documented in the assessment reports. Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff and the DoD CIO to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.

Specific performance metrics include the following:

Provide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.			
			
Conduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.

MEECN is on track to achieve the FY 2018, FY 2019, and FY 2020 targets of provisioning the Joint Staff requirements within the allocated resources 90% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) mission focuses on developing Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise solutions to Combatant Commands, Services, and Defense-wide agencies to ensure critical mission execution in the face of cyber attacks.  The ISSP ensures that, the network, the computing centers, and core enterprise services will evolve to better support a joint cybersecurity/information assurance model that has common enterprise-scale perimeter defenses and will support a broad range of sharing policies from completely unclassified to tightly-held within a classified community.  The ISSP will test and develop active-active defensive capabilities; test and integrate software defined networking and orchestration closed-loop security; perform research, development and engineering of emerging cyber situational awareness technologies; harden the network by providing architecture support, systems engineering and analytical functions for Endpoint and Perimeter defense capabilities; cyber IT infrastructure and automation support to deploy enterprise-wide next generation identity technologies; and develop and evolve an integrated cyber domain security workforce to be on the leading edge of defensive capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The increase of +$30.200 in FY 2020 is due to +$36.000 of additional funding for Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) and the Secure Application Development Program. The funding will be used to develop and implement the Automated Account Management data sharing and automation and Master User Record (MUR) for the automated account provisioning effort within ICAM (+$28.000); resource R&amp;D innovation efforts to evaluate commercial meta/virtual directory data synchronization services in alignment with identity management, credentialing, active authentication, federation, and automated authorization for the federalized authentication services within ICAM (+$2.000); and support innovation activities and mission priorities for secure application development and quantitative analysis tools within the Secure Application Development program (+$6.000). This is offset by a decrease of -$5.800 in FY 2020 is due to the implementation of a standard information technology (IT) enterprise patch management capability.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

The GCCS-J Program is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint C2 system of record.  It incorporates core planning and assessment tools required by Combatant Commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs. It provides support for commanders and staffs as they conduct joint and multinational operations by providing a fused picture of the battle space within an integrated system that is supporting joint warfighter needs today.  GCCS-J is currently focused on sustainment, synchronization, and modernization to meet emerging operational needs by modifying and enhancing elements or capabilities in order to implement new requirements, enhance functionality, increase efficiency and lower operating and deployment costs while taking advantage of the progress made by current operational systems and technologies.  The GCCS-J program is also executing incremental modernization of C2 capabilities using the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved needs.

JPES is a portfolio of capabilities supporting joint policies, processes, procedures, and reporting structures. It is supported by communications and information technology used by the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC).  JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor the following activities: planning, execute mobilization, deployment, employment and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization.   At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment. One of the key capabilities residing within the JPES portfolio of sustaining the existing Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) while modernization of JOPES is planned and implemented.  The JPES portfolio also includes a core set of infrastructure services consisting of  the JPES Framework (JFW) and a variety of mission applications to include Joint Force Projection (JFP), Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM) and eventually the capabilities that will replace JOPES.

JC2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns closely to the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture.  The JC2 Architecture describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  It is the authoritative source of information and technical direction for the JC2 arena.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$1.561 in FY 2018 is due to SBIR/STTR transfer (-$1.262) and a 25-28% reduction of the operational capabilities requested by the user community (-$0.299) . 6.0.1.0 reached FOC in 1st quarter FY19, with capabilities that are equal or slightly better than the previous version 4.3 (to be sunset  FY 19/20); there was/is additional operational capabilities identified by the user community (COCOMS and Services) to be built based on changing/emerging threats.  The decrease of -$15.000 in FY 2020 is attributed to a program re-baseline due to contract delays for baseline infrastructure.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) is DoD’s Joint Command and Control (JC2) system of record and provides the foundation for migration of service-unique C2 systems into a Joint, interoperable environment. The Defense Information System Agency’s (DISAs) portfolio includes funding to support GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the JC2 Architecture.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  Additionally, DISA provides critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  

JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DOD’s Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 December 2005) and Adaptive Planning Roadmap II (5 March 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter a fully interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

The JC2 Architecture is a foundational element of JC2 capabilities for the Department.  The JC2 Architecture provides a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  Each year, the DISA architecture team produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities, anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the JC2 community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The GCCS-J program will continue to update and execute the GCCS-J Modernization planning guidance based on operational priorities, and updated DoD guidance.  These updates will support the Joint C2 Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) goals of reducing cost, providing additional capability to the warfighter and sustaining existing C2 capabilities. Planned activities include further prototype, proof of concept and experimental efforts that will focus on transitioning GCCS-J to an open standards architecture deployable in a variety of operational environments (i.e. local, cloud, mobile, etc).  This effort will include development of GCCS-J capabilities to enhance functionality, modernize and enhance the security posture of the application, increase efficiency, and lower operating and deployment costs through the employment of new and emerging technologies.

The increase of +$22.954 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 will modernize GCCS-J into a cloud-based, enterprise system which DISA will use to provide C2 as a service throughout DoD, including the services.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Use of performance-based contract awards is maximized while use of Time and Material contracts is minimized to those providing programmatic support versus software development, integration, or testing.  All development, integration, and migration efforts within the portfolio are primarily supported through Cost Reimbursable Task Orders issued under competitively awarded contracts.  Acquisition Strategies are structured to retain contractors capable of satisfying cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  Contract awards incorporate provisions requiring contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data.  This strategy mitigates risk by requiring monthly Contract Performance Reviews (CPRs) and utilizing award fee contracts where appropriate to incentivize performance.  Both GCCS-J and JPES apply formal acquisition rigor to include reporting requirements, as appropriate, by acquisition program designation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) provides a full array of electromagnetic spectrum services and capabilities, ranging from short notice on-the-ground operational support at the forward edge, to long range planning in pursuit of national strategic objectives. These services/capabilities are in direct support of Combatant Commanders, the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer, Military Services, and Defense Agencies. The DSO is the focal point for electromagnetic spectrum analysis and the development of integrated spectrum plans and strategies to address current and future needs for DoD spectrum access. In addition, DSO serves as DoD's spectrum advocate at national and international forums and conducts extensive outreach to both industry and government. DSO also implements enterprise spectrum management capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency and agility to improve spectrum-dependent capabilities in support of United States and Coalition operations. This includes acquiring, implementing and sustaining the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS) which provides an integrated catalog of joint net-centric spectrum management tools and services. Electromagnetic Spectrum Management enables information dominance through effective spectrum operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$0.373 in FY 2018 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs (-$0.259), a congressional general reduction for the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) of -$0.044, and decrease of -$0.070 that will result in fewer Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) electromagnetic environmental effects surveys conducted. 

The decrease of -$0.113 in FY 2019 is due to a congressional general reduction (FFRDC).
 
The increase of +$12.000 in FY 2020 is to begin foundational efforts in support of electromagnetic (EM) battle management (EMBM) to enable effective joint electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) operations. The funds support the integration of data feeds and analytics with the Joint Spectrum Data Repository (JSDR) to provide holistic spectrum situational awareness and are critical to understanding the EM operating environment and to inform military decision-makers. Spectrum maneuverability will be critical to future military operations engaging near-peer adversaries and will be dependent on a clear understanding of the spectrum operational environment.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Spectrum Center (JSC), which is a division of Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO), designs, develops, and maintains Department of Defense (DoD) automated spectrum management systems, evaluation tools, and databases. The databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment (EME). Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts.
 
Improved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use. This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Engineering support services are provided by the use of a contract. No in-house government capability exists, nor is it practical to develop one that can provide the expertise necessary to fulfill the mission and responsibilities of DSO. Full and open competition was used for the current contract with EXELIS, Inc. GEMSIS' acquisition approach is to obtain capabilities by adopting existing capabilities, buying commercial products, or developing new capabilities by delivering incrementally within the context of a streamlined and adaptive acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>1. Provide engineering support to DoD Components to ensure E3 and spectrum supportability requirements are addressed during the acquisition life-cycle meeting at least 90% of program suspenses. 
2. Execute effective emerging spectrum technologies evaluation process that generates timely and relevant products evaluating at least 3 technologies per quarter.
3. Provide technical E3 and spectrum engineering support upon request from the Combatant Commands, their components and the Military Services with a minimum 98% response rate.  
4. Develop an operational Joint spectrum management system that delivers at least 90% of products on schedule in accordance with objective scheduled events and deliverables as approved in the Acquisition Program Baseline- Schedule Status of systems.

All metric results are classified.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Information Environment (JIE) construct is a consolidated secure and defensible environment across DoD.  This is comprised of unified, consolidated and shared information technology (IT) infrastructure, enterprise services, and standardized security architectures throughout the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) to achieve full spectrum superiority, improve mission effectiveness, increase security and realize IT efficiencies.  

The target objective state of JIE is a DODIN that optimizes the use of DoD's IT assets from the administrative and operational planning at the Pentagon to the tactical edge; to include our mission partners through converging communications, computing, enterprise services, and defense of the DODIN that can be leveraged for all Department missions. 

When implemented, JIE will reduce DoD's Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), improved security by reducing the attack surface of our networks, and enable Combatant Commands/Services/Agencies (CC/S/A) to more efficiently access information to perform their missions from any authorized IT device, any time, from anywhere in the world.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Decrease in FY 2018 of -$0.139 reflects a transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. 

Increase in FY 2020 of +$15.280 primarily due to support architecture development and conduct developmental test and evaluation on pilot capability for the next-generation JRSS. The funding will also support testing of additional enhancements to JRSS 2.0 capabilities, integration/testing of tech refresh items into architecture, as well as development and testing of (DoD Cyber Situational Awareness Analytic Capabilities) CSAAC analytics.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a joint DoD security architecture deployed regionally throughout the world. Each of the 23 NIPR and 25 SIPR stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The savings are realized by coupling the JRSS and JMS. The JRSS collapses replicated IT security functionality for all Department of Defense (DoD) components into relatively few regionally located stacks.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a joint DoD security architecture deployed regionally throughout the world. Each of the 23 NIPR and 25 SIPR stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.															
															
FY 2018 Actual: 100% successful testing of new pre-production capabilities for Full Packet Capture analytics (e.g. ArcSight and Splunk log); JMS 1.5 data orchestrator aggregation; and JRSS 1.5 active stack capabilities through the Joint Interoperability Test Command. MET

FY 2019 Target:  100% successful testing of JRSS tech refresh hardware/software and testing of six medium complexity analytics.													
															
FY 2020 (Estimated):  100% successful testing of JRSS tech refresh hardware/software and testing of six medium complexity analytics.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Decrease of -$8.257 in FY 2018 is due to congressional directed reduction of -$5.000, transfer of funding to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs of -$1.479, and reduction of -$1.778 due a delay in Investigation Management (IM) correcting the investment profile for execution.

Increase of +16.000 in FY 2019 is due to reprogramming funds from Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) to Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to fund Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) capabilities that are part of a larger development effort.

Increase of +$34.445 in FY 2020 is to develop built-in sustainment features and advance metrics, and enhance the secure data warehouse; includes oversight and management product work, specifies the initial hardware, provides requirements for development, provides support for requirement accomplishment, coordination, data protection, conduct testing, and after completion to retain all responsibility of application enhancements (+$13.445).  Also, the increase of +$21.000 is due to the reprogramming from O&amp;M to RDT&amp;E for IM development to provide the business logic, work flow, rules, algorithms, etc. for case initiation through closure.  Funding is required for a new, transformational continuous evaluation (CE) capability that includes machine learning and natural language processing as part of an Artificial Intelligence Platform as a Service.  The full architectural stack includes an underlying Data Brokerage as a Service and is being constructed as a prototype application to replace the DoD’s existing CE application. In addition to development capabilities, additional funding is required for build-out of Agile pipeline that includes Development Security Operations which includes Cyber and Test activities to maintain Agile sprint and increment cadence.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) coordinates with the Military Services and Defense Intelligence Agencies to conduct Joint/Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) testing and analysis, including event coordination, configuration, instrumentation and integration functions on the Distributed Development and Test Enterprise (DDTE).  Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual, operationally-relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue to conduct compliance testing of data, metadata, and web services against established standards to enhance the sharing and promote reuse of net centric solutions.  Continuing to expand TaaS capabilities that enable DCGS entities and other Communities of Interest (COI) to test for standards compliance during the development and acquisition processes. Continue enhancement of instrumentation and automated data collection tools to support testing on multiple network domains and enclaves where the DCGS PoRs, National Agencies and Coalition Partners test and operate.  Plan and conduct testing of enterprise cybersecurity solutions to determine if they comply with standards, support interoperability between the DCGS PoRs, and meet the DCGS Enterprise cybersecurity requirements. Data collected by these assessment efforts are reflected in an annual DCGS Enterprise Assessment Report that delineates how well the DCGS Enterprise shows progress over time in meeting the capabilities and closing the gaps reflected in the 2016 DCGS Enterprise Initial Capabilities Document. 

The increase of +$0.019 in FY 2018 will provide for the implementation of enhanced data analytics for DCGS.  This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.114 attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The DCGS T&amp;E FT performs a minimum of six DCGS Enterprise assessments per year, and the results are consolidated into the T&amp;E FT Enterprise Assessment Report annually.  The T&amp;E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team's State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time.

The T&amp;E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity. Of the six DCGS PoR systems, two hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, &amp; Computers/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases. One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending. Of the three remaining PoRs, two are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&amp;E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events. Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&amp;E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year.

1. Metric: T&amp;E FT will perform a minimum of nine (9) DCGS Enterprise assessments in FY 2018 and ten (10) DCGS Enterprise Assessments in FY 2019 and FY 2020.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Teleport Program Office (TPO) uses the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS equipment when possible. The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated through post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes. These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE). Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2018, FY 2019 and FY 2020.

Generation 1/2 Metric: Percentage of system changes resulting in interoperability certification

FY 2018 Target: 100% / Actual 100%
FY 2019 Target: 100%
FY 2020 Target: 100%</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

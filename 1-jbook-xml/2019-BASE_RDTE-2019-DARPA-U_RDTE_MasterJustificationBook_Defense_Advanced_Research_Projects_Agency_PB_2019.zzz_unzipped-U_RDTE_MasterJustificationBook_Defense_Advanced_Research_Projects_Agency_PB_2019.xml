                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences.

The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security requirements.  Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk.  This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation.  The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national security and homeland defense.

The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security.  Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Meanwhile, cyber threats grow in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk.  The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project will produce breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.

The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. The Beyond Scaling programs in this project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. 

The Beyond Scaling Sciences project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. This Project is not a new start. It aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in Projects ES-01 and CCS-02 in this same Program Element.

The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems.

The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in computing and the computing-reliant subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk.  This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation.  The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national security and homeland defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD.  However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD.  One focus area of the Human Social Systems thrust is to develop and validate new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems.  Another focus area is to identify methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress.  This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at city scale.</r2:Description>

Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics and integrated circuits.  In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and synthetic chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models.  The SD2 program is developing tools to enable robust design despite the lack of complete scientific models.  This involves collecting raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, developing computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and creating data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design.  SD2 application domains include synthetic biology, solar cell chemistry, and protein design.</r2:Description>

Rigorous mathematical theories are also being developed to address uncertainty in the modeling and design of complex multi-scale physical and engineering systems, incorporating capabilities to handle noisy data and model uncertainty that are well beyond the scope of current capabilities.  Other work in this thrust focuses on developing the mathematical and computational tools required to generate and better manage the enormous complexity of design, ultimately allowing designers to more easily discover non-intuitive (yet realizable) designs that fully leverage new materials and advanced manufacturing approaches now available.

                                                    <r2:Description>The World Modelers program is creating explanatory models for natural and human-mediated systems at regional and global scales.  The world is highly interdependent, and disruption of natural resources, supply chains, and production systems can have severe consequences.  The World Modelers capability is focused on regional and global systems with the goal of generating timely indications and warnings of impending catastrophe.  Water and food security are application domains of particular interest, as persistent drought may cause crops to fail, leading to migration and regional conflicts.  The World Modelers program is developing techniques for automating the creation, maintenance, and validation of large-scale integrated models using publicly available news and analyst reports as a structuring mechanism, and government and commercial data as quantitative inputs.  One critical issue involves determining when correlations are strictly statistical versus when they result from causal relationships; in the latter case, models can reveal effective interventions.  Advances in machine reading and learning, semantic technologies, big data analysis, geo-spatial and economic modeling, and environmental simulation bring this strategic capability within reach.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Communicating With Computers (CWC) program is advancing human-computer interaction by enabling computers to comprehend language, gesture, facial expression and other communicative modalities in context.  Human language is inherently ambiguous, so humans depend strongly on perception of the physical world and context to communicate.  CWC will provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense the physical world, encode the physical world in a perceptual structure, and link language to this perceptual encoding.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding, which are essential for human communication.  CWC will also extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts such as virtual constructs in the cyber domain.  CWC advances will impact military application areas such as robotics and command and control.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) program is developing an automated framework that permits software systems to seamlessly adapt to changing resource conditions in an evolving operational environment.  Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.  The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continued operation.  BRASS will create tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes.</r2:Description>

Current learning machines are fully configured in advance of deployment, meaning that they have difficulty accounting for in-the-field mission changes or for unexpected deviations in the data being processed.  To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge.  Areas of research will include network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.  These capabilities would impact a broad array of military applications that require processing and understanding data in real-time, often have limited data sets for training, and must be deployed in environments where unpredictable events may occur.</r2:Description>

Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in exciting new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and two-person strategy games (Chess, Go).  But in all of these application domains, the machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized; broad, commonsense reasoning by machines remains elusive.  The program will create more human-like knowledge representations, for example, perceptually-grounded representations, to enable commonsense reasoning by machines about the physical world and spatio-temporal phenomena.  Equipping AI systems with more human-like reasoning capabilities will make it possible for humans to teach/correct a machine as they interact and cooperate on tasks, enabling more equal collaboration and ultimately symbiotic partnerships between humans and machines.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Big Mechanism program is creating new approaches to automated computational intelligence applicable to diverse domains such as biology, cyber, economics, social science, and intelligence.  Mastering these domains requires the capability to create abstract, causal models from massive volumes of diverse data.  Current modeling approaches are heavily reliant on human insight and expertise, but the complexity of these models will soon exceed the capacity for human comprehension.  Big Mechanism will create technologies to extract and normalize information for incorporation in flexible knowledge bases; reasoning engines that can infer general rules from a collection of observations; and knowledge synthesis techniques to create models of extreme complexity consistent with huge volumes of data.  Big Mechanism applications will accommodate an operator-in-the-loop to clarify ambiguities and reconcile detected inconsistencies.  The program has focused on cancer modeling due to the availability of experimental data.  The complexity of this problem is representative of challenges facing the DoD in areas such as cyber attribution and open-source intelligence.</r2:Description>

This capability increases the number of people who can effectively contribute, makes experts more productive, and enables the creation of new tactical applications that are inconceivable given today's tools.  The key enabling technology is a radically new programming paradigm called probabilistic programming that enables developers to quickly build generative models of phenomena and queries of interest which a compiler then converts into efficient applications.  PPAML technologies were designed for application to a wide range of military domains including Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) exploitation, robotic and autonomous system navigation and control, and medical diagnostics.</r2:Description>

At present, adversaries can extract sensitive information from stolen software, which could include cryptographic private keys, special inputs/failsafe modes, and proprietary algorithms.  Today's state-of-the-art in software obfuscation adds junk code (loops that do nothing, renaming of variables, redundant conditions, etc.) that is not resilient against automated tools.  Recent breakthroughs in theoretical cryptography have the potential to make software obfuscation into a mathematically rigorous science, very much like what the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm did for the encryption of messages in the 1970s.  In its present form, cryptographic obfuscation incurs too much runtime overhead to be practical.  The SafeWare program will take this very early-stage obfuscation theory and increase its practicality and efficiency.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program is developing techniques to detect algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities and side channel attacks in software.  Historically, adversaries have exploited software implementation flaws through buffer and heap overflow attacks.  Advances in operating systems have largely mitigated such attacks, so cyber adversaries are now finding new ways of compromising software.  Algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks are emerging as a new generation of attacks since they depend on intrinsic properties of software algorithms rather than implementation flaws.  The STAC program seeks to develop analysis tools and techniques to detect vulnerabilities to these new attacks in the software which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend.</r2:Description>

In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.

Within this project, Beyond Scaling programs will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling).  Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems.  Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon.  Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory.  Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Beyond Scaling programs move to Project ES-02, Beyond Scaling Sciences, in FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications, sensing, and radar systems.  HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  HAVOC will fund basic research in vacuum electronics to improve understanding of the various phenomena governing vacuum electronic amplifiers operating at mm-wave frequencies above 75 GHz.  Focus areas will include modeling and simulation techniques, advanced manufacturing methods, novel beam-wave interaction structures, high current density and long-life cathodes, and other relevant topics.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to identify, investigate, and demonstrate inertial sensor technologies for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  Applied research efforts are funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Signal Processing at RF (SPAR) program will investigate advanced analog components to process radio frequency (RF) signals for communications, radar, and electronic warfare applications.  Today, electronic components are limited in their ability to distinguish between two or more signals operating at the same frequency when one signal is strong enough to jam the others.  The jamming signal, in this case, saturates the receiver electronics much like loud music drowns out a quiet conversation.  By using advancements in new semiconductor materials, processing, and novel signal interaction mechanisms, SPAR components will be able to pick out friendly RF signals from both intentional and unintentional jamming signals, even when those signals sit on top of one another in frequency.  This capability would enable a range of new applications including communications in contested battlefield RF environments, jamming the RF spectrum while maintaining communication, and full-duplex radio communication.  Other potential applications include equipping mobile radios with SPAR-enabled front ends for simultaneous jam-resistant two-way communication and electronic warfare.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Magnetic Miniaturized and Monolithically Integrated Components (M3IC) program aims to integrate magnetic components onto semiconductor materials, improving the size and functionality of electromagnetic (EM) systems for communications, radar, and electronic warfare (EW).  Current EM systems use magnetic components such as circulators, inductors, and isolators that are bulky and cannot be integrated with electronic circuitry.  This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function.  Reducing the Size, Weight, And Power (SWaP) of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials and provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals.  For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.  The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) program seeks to develop efficient radio frequency (RF) transmitters operating in the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) ranges, for portable applications in underground and underwater communications.  For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal.  This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide.  Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF.  This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size.  AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system.  This new capability would enable a range of applications including hard-to-jam wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links.  Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Short Range Independent Microrobotics Program (SHRIMP) will develop microrobots with the ability to clandestinely enter tactical environments and perform close-proximity (within 10cm) functions.  These ant-sized microrobots could obtain local sensing data, such as visual, audio, or chemical trace data, whereas similar capabilities today would require hand-placed sensors or not be performed at all.  SHRIMP microrobots should be able to self-navigate to an objective location and operate indefinitely from harvested energy.  The primary technical developments needed are in the efficiency, robustness, and control of millimeter-scale actuators, which allow the robots to move using new materials, processing, and sensor integration techniques.  Recent advances in the strength, efficiency, and robustness of small actuators points to the possibility of efficient land microrobots capable of carrying their power source and traveling nearly 0.5 kilometers on a single battery charge.  Successful execution of the SHRIMP program will advance the micro-robotics field, allowing for practical national security applications such as clandestine tactical data collection or strategic communication disruption enabled by colonies of deployed microrobots.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will investigate high-performance photonic components for a compact, robust, and highly-accurate optical frequency synthesizer suited to various mission-critical DoD applications.  Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities.  Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers.  DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers.  The program could lead to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, and high-resolution detection of chemical/biological threats at a distance.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

The program sponsored academic research teams focused on technology areas, determined by government and industry experts that impact long-range DoD needs.  The sponsored academic research base included approximately 46 universities, 188 faculty researchers, 628 students, and more than 112 industry associate personnel.  Industry provided 60% of program funding, while DARPA provided the remaining 40% of funding.  STARNet research was divided into three centers that focused on system issues (design architecture and system design) and three centers that focused on device and materials issues (high-performance and low power devices).  As the projects in the device and materials centers matured, they were expected to be utilized by the system centers to enhance improvements in system design and fabrication.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will investigate the innovative technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years.  Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  To enable this possibility, N-ZERO's basic research component will consider highly innovative sensors and sensor architectures as well as signal processing and digitization technologies with near-zero power consumption.  In particular, the program will explore and develop a fundamental understanding of the trade space between power consumption, the minimum detectable signal, and the probability of falsely detecting a trigger.  An applied research component is budgeted under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

Historically, the DoD provided leadership in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  These basic explorations include: novel mechanisms for computation based on inherent material properties, new methods to accelerate the identification and utilization of emerging materials, and innovative processes to vertically integrate these materials with others to realize superior computational mechanisms.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Architectures and Design program will investigate application-specific circuit architectures that ensure continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of continued scaling in silicon transistors (Moore's Law).  Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components.  As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization.  This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits.  Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems.  Further research would also develop tools to create exact representations of physical hardware.  Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide benefits by improving electronics systems that do not depend on continued rapid improvements in silicon transistors.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Beyond Scaling Sciences project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. This Project is not a new start. It aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in Projects ES-01 and CCS-02 in this same Program Element.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will investigate new materials to support next-generation logic and memory components.  Historically, the DoD provided leadership in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  These basic explorations include: novel mechanisms for computation based on inherent material properties, new methods to accelerate the identification and utilization of emerging materials, and innovative processes to vertically integrate these materials with others to realize superior computational mechanisms.

Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components.  As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization.  This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits.  Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems.  Further research would also develop tools to create exact representations of physical hardware.  Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide benefits by improving electronics systems that do not depend on continued rapid improvements in silicon transistors.

Current learning machines are fully configured in advance of deployment, meaning that they have difficulty accounting for in-the-field mission changes or for unexpected deviations in the data being processed.  To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge.  Areas of research will include network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.  These capabilities would impact a broad array of military applications that require processing and understanding data in real-time, often have limited data sets for training, and must be deployed in environments where unpredictable events may occur.</r2:Description>

The JUMP program will not only push fundamental technology research but also establish long-range microelectronic research themes with greater emphasis on end-application and systems-level computation.  By discovering the science underlying new technologies and overcoming engineering challenges, JUMP will enable DoD applications to exploit the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio frequency (RF) to terahertz (THz) and to employ both distributed and centralized computing with embedded intelligence and memory.</r2:Description>

The Biological Complexity (BioCom) program seeks to enhance the understanding of the basic processes associated with biological network interactions, communication, and control to enable novel approaches and technology development to improve warfighter readiness and military platform resilience.  Key advances expected from this research will include the identification of approaches to create stable, predictable, and dynamic control mechanisms of biological networks.  Such information will allow the determination of a biosystem's state and enable the prediction of state.  Applications range from infectious disease mitigation or prevention, to maintain warfighter health, to predicting and leveraging biological systems for managing communities of microorganisms to prevent biofouling on maritime military systems.</r2:Description>

The Engineered Living Materials program will pursue new approaches to engineer complex, multi-cellular systems for enhanced capabilities and functional materials to improve military infrastructure design and logistics. Complex biological materials and systems have unique properties (e.g., controlled porosity and high strength-to-weight ratios) not only because of the inherent components but also because of how those components are assembled together across length scales.  Engineering biology tools and techniques are now at a stage to pursue the organization and function of multi-cellular systems for a new class of improved capabilities.  This program will develop underlying technological platforms to enable information-driven assembly of hierarchical multi-cellular systems for the development of advanced materials.  Advances in this program will impact military approaches to infrastructure design in austere environments as well as established methods for manufacture and maintenance of military platforms (e.g., tanks, planes, ships).</r2:Description>

This program will investigate approaches for identifying pathogens based on specific behaviors, or phenotypes, such as niche finding or cell toxicity.  Unlike current methods, which rely on a priori knowledge of the pathogen and cannot detect or otherwise analyze unknown threats, this approach will handle scenarios involving engineered or undiscovered bacterial pathogens that do not have known hallmarks.  Advances in this area will produce a completely new capability to assess the emergence of pathogens and to detect pathogens that have been specifically engineered to evade detection by traditional methods.  Resulting systems may be used to alert deployed military personnel operating around the world to new biothreats, or in response to a U.S.-based discovery, outbreak, or pandemic.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale and adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.

Living Foundries will develop tools to simplify, abstract, and standardize the biological production pathway optimization process.  Additionally, Living Foundries will identify the fundamental design rules that govern the construction and organization of underlying genetic elements in the production pathways.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities, and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation, and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality.  Applied research for this program is budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Biological Robustness in Complex Settings (BRICS) program will leverage newly developed technologies to enable radical new approaches for engineering biology.  An emerging field, engineering biology is focused on developing the tools to harness the powerful synthetic and functional capabilities of biology.  These tools will facilitate design and biological production of new chemicals and materials, sensing capabilities, therapeutics, and numerous other applications.  This rapidly developing technological capability opens the door to new applications that have previously been out of reach, and offers substantial potential advantages in terms of cost and novel functionality.

Fundamental work in this area will focus on understanding the underlying principles for engineering robust and safe microbes and microbial communities that perform as designed over the long-term.  This program has applied research efforts funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in warfighter care related to health monitoring and preventing the spread of infectious disease.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling, and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  To enable in-theater, continuous analysis and treatment of warfighters, this project will explore multiple diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including the use of bacterial predators as therapeutics against infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens; developing techniques to enable rapid transient immunity for emerging pathogens; exploring methods to slow damage from pathological infection or traumatic injury; and identifying fundamental biological mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Advances in this area may be used as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research efforts in this area will apply recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness.  One approach to achieve this goal is identifying the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species may be combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival.  By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, one may formulate a survival blueprint to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection.  This approach is orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention.  Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Military readiness and national security depend on the health and well-being of military service members.  Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance.  Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness.  The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust will investigate fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen.  Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants.  Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a National Security risk as a potential pandemic.</r2:Description>

Many emerging infectious disease outbreaks have origins in animal reservoirs and occur in areas where DoD personnel are deployed, putting them at high risk of endemic and emerging diseases.  The Preventing the Emergence of Disease (PED) program will investigate how animal pathogens are transmitted to humans and explore novel approaches to prevent these events.  Tools such as detailed molecular analysis and bioinformatics will be leveraged. Researchers will develop models to quantify the probability of pathogen disease transmission from animals to humans.  Promising intervention approaches will be developed to prevent viral species jumps from animal reservoirs to humans. Predicting such jumps is a key capability to mitigating outbreaks originating in animal reservoirs.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Based on initial research conducted under the Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience program, the Early Battlefield Interventions (EBI) program will explore new methods to slow and limit damage caused by acute trauma and infection often suffered by our warfighters under far-forward conditions.  Research efforts will apply advances in molecular and cellular biology, cell signaling, and biomaterials to develop new tools to alter the time course of pathological processes associated with infection and tissue damage.  This tactic is a departure from traditional therapeutic approaches that seek to control symptoms associated with active infections or innate physiological responses to tissue trauma.  Advances in this area may be applied to the creation of both prophylactic and therapeutic medical countermeasures to forward-deployed service members.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program will develop the underlying technologies to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing capabilities which are currently available only in centralized laboratories in the U.S. to non-tertiary care and individual settings.  ADEPT will develop and exploit biological tools for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop techniques that will enable the rapid establishment of transient immunity through stimulation of the production of components of the immune system to impart effective but temporary protection.  This transient immunity would bridge the time gap between the delivery of a vaccine and the development of a long term protective immune response.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Harnessing Biological Systems program explored fundamental approaches to applying the advantages of nature's building blocks and principles in the design of biological technologies and systems.  Rather than creating biomimetic designs that imitate naturally evolved capabilities this program sought to transition to a biocentric design approach, developing tools and understanding mechanisms to leverage evolutionary advances from the start.  Key advances from this research included identifying approaches to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  One example was the identification of the underlying mechanisms by which predatory bacteria prey upon and consume other antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic to humans.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antibacterial therapies that rely on small molecule antibiotics.  Advances in this area may be applied to a range of biological technologies including the autonomous control of epidemics.</r2:Description>

Successful battlefield medical and neural interface technologies developed within this Program Element address a broad range of DoD challenges to ensure warfighter readiness, including both resilience to infectious disease and neurotechnology for improved warfighter performance.  To maintain warfighter health, battlefield medical technologies research in this project will investigate disease forecasting, detection, and therapeutic response.  Example projects include a predictive platform for forecasting disease outbreak, identification of early infection biomarkers to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater, new methods to rapidly develop medical countermeasures in response to an emerging biothreat, and in-theater manufacturing capabilities for field-relevant pharmaceuticals to reduce the logistical burden and infrastructure requirements.  To improve warfighter performance, this project will develop new neural architectures and data processing algorithms to interface the nervous system with multiple devices, enabling control of robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  Additionally, advanced evidence-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Neuro-Adaptive Technology program will explore and develop advanced technologies for real-time detection and monitoring of neural activity.  One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior.  Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders.  Efforts under this program will specifically examine the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders.  The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices.  These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel.  Technologies of interest under this thrust include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Wounded warriors with amputated limbs get limited benefit from recent advances in prosthetic-limb technology because the user interface for controlling the limb is low-performance and unreliable.  Through investments in the DARPA Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, novel interface systems have been developed that overcome these issues and are designed to last for the lifetime of the patient.  The goal of the Prosthetic Hand Proprioception &amp; Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program is to create the first bi-directional (motor &amp; sensory) peripheral nerve implant for controlling and sensing advanced prosthetic limb systems.  With a strong focus on transition, the HAPTIX program will create and transition clinically relevant technology in support of wounded warriors suffering from single or multiple limb loss.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Generalizing Complex Biological Signals

As part of their daily duties, many military personnel must handle large volumes of data and interact with complex systems.  These tasks could be made less difficult with advanced neurotechnology platforms, but all such devices currently require invasive surgery to implement.  The Neural Signal Interfaces and Applications (NSIA) program will develop non-invasive neurotechnologies able to interface with the nervous system with high resolution and precision without surgery.  NSIA will utilize recent advances to transduce neural signals through tissue.  Resulting technologies will facilitate standard human-machine interfaces for improved workload balance between man and machine.</r2:Description>

In both instances, the DoD needs effective countermeasures to protect its deployed forces and maintain warfighter readiness.  The Pandemic Prevention program will focus on novel methods to rapidly accelerate countermeasure discovery, pre-clinical testing, and manufacturing.  This program seeks to advance and integrate newly developed approaches including bioinformatics assessment of genetic sequencing and nucleic acid-based vaccines and to address technology bottlenecks associated with each stage of medical countermeasure development.  Additional research will investigate new methods improving the manufacturability, distribution, and delivery of novel therapeutics.  Pandemic Prevention will enable an integrated therapeutic development platform that leverages state-of-the-art technologies to prevent disease outbreaks.</r2:Description>

ADEPT will focus on the development of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-based vaccines, potentially eliminating the time and labor required for traditional manufacture of a vaccine while at the same time improving efficacy.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop methods to transiently deliver nucleic acids for vaccines and therapeutics, and kinetically control the timing and levels of gene expression so that these drugs will be safe and effective for use in healthy subjects.  ADEPT will also focus on advanced development of key elements for simple-to-operate diagnostic devices.  A companion basic research effort is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust developed new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield.  Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method, other than surgical intervention, can effectively treat intracavity bleeding.  A focus in this thrust was the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of hemostasis and wound control for non-compressible hemorrhage in the abdominal space, regardless of wound geometry or location within that space.  This thrust also investigated non-invasive techniques and equipment to use laser energy to treat intracranial hemorrhage through the skull and tissues in a pre-surgical environment.  Finally, in order to address logistical delays associated with delivering necessary therapeutics to the battlefield, this thrust developed a pharmacy on demand that will provide a rapid response capability to enable far-forward medical providers the ability to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information and Communications Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  

     The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.

     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the core computing and networking technologies required to protect DoD's information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems.  The technologies will provide cost-effective security and survivability solutions that enable DoD information systems to operate correctly and continuously while under attack, and to be rapidly recovered/reconstituted in the aftermath of an attack. 

   The Language Understanding and Symbiotic Automation project develops technologies to enable computing systems to understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events; and to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as partners to human operators. Enabling computing systems in this manner is of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act. Incorporating these technologies in military systems will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems to operate safely with high degrees of autonomy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications.  Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.  The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems.  Advances in these areas could allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations.  Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, should help develop new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) program seeks to catalyze the development of systems, called Collaborative Intelligent Radios (CIRs) that intelligently share and optimize wireless spectrum usage without prior knowledge of each other's operating characteristics.  SC2 will address the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access.  Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack.  First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized.  Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack.  SC2 will address this challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time.  In particular, SC2 participants will be challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies.  SC2 will conduct two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years.  The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The RF Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS) program will address the performance limitations of conventional radio frequency (RF) systems such as radar, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, or communications.  Currently, the capabilities of these systems are fixed at the time of design and limited by their designer's vision.  Conversely, a generic RFMLS system would learn how to reconfigure its circuits and processing to meet the requirements of a desired application in a specific environment.  The relevant RF features are hand crafted and human specified today, and would instead be learned through machine learning algorithms applied within the RF system itself.  The RFMLS system would later learn to adapt to changing conditions and requirements, making a much more robust RF system solution.  This flexibility should reduce the time and cost of continually re-designing and upgrading new systems and extend RF system performance beyond the limits of human designers.  RMFLS exploits recent advancements in machine learning that have not previously been applied to RF systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Adversarial AI for RF program aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with applications for national security, particularly in areas such as electronic warfare. Given that U.S. and potential adversaries are developing AI technology with potentially revolutionary capabilities, DoD must prepare for conflicts that include offensive and defensive AI actors. Adversarial AI will develop methodologies for protecting AI-enabled DoD systems from adversary attempts to elicit an erroneous response (spoofing) and for significantly increasing AI system reliability and safety. The resulting AI algorithms should also ensure that AI-enabled DoD devices offer human-understandable explanations for their suggested course of action, to the maximum extent possible. To enable this future, the Adversarial AI program will leverage and advance newly formed links between machine learning and security and look to extend these emerging techniques to military specific domains that are emerging such as cognitive Electronic Warfare (EW) systems.  Finally, the program may inform the correct mechanism to train AI systems for use in adversarial situations.</r2:Description>

To develop operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today watch live battlefield feeds to detect items of interest, fusing together and interpreting information from multiple sensors and sources.  The amount of information gathered, however, is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.  Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlefield in real time.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Electronic Globalization effort aims to develop advanced capabilities for validating the function of digital, analog, and mixed-signal integrated circuits (IC) given limited design specifications.  These ICs are critical to nearly all military systems.  Globalization and rapid growth in the commercial electronics industry have limited DoD's ability to influence and regulate IC fabrication.  DoD today accounts for a relatively small portion of the overall IC market and the vast majority of IC manufacturing capacity lies overseas.  As a result, parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet the stated specifications for performance and reliability.  Electronic Globalization will pursue the technologies required to address this and other risks to DoD IC's, such as reverse engineering, counterfeiting, and the theft of U.S. intellectual property.  The effort will support the development of key risk-reduction techniques including advanced imaging and computational methods for identifying an IC's functional elements.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Cortical Processor program developed algorithms and hardware that can better handle the increasingly large and diverse sensor data streams used by battlefield systems.  By leveraging advances in machine learning, the program yielded systems with the flexibility to understand and adapt to new contexts and new types of sensed data (e.g. new radio frequency or infrared signals).  Current sensor platforms, conversely, are pre-programmed only to interpret specific data types and require a laborious coding effort to accommodate new types of data or contexts.  Cortical Processor developed hardware implementations that gracefully handle multiple data streams and limit the programming burden required for sensing and interpreting a complex scenario.  The program was enabled by bio-inspired algorithms that benefit from research into biological learning and data processing.  Cortical Processor's applied research component investigated silicon circuit designs that are most suitable for high-performance, low-power, real-time sensing and data processing.</r2:Description>

The potential for a cyber-enabled attack on the U.S. power grid is a national security issue, as the ability of the military to deploy and project force is dependent on the effective and efficient functioning of civilian logistics and supply systems.  RADICS will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, establish secure emergency communications networks, characterize attacks, and detect sensor spoofing.  RADICS technology development is coordinated with and will transition to U.S. government elements responsible for defense of critical infrastructure.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Dispersed Computing program is developing techniques to distribute computing tasks across network computing elements to enable more efficient utilization of enterprise and Internet-based storage, processing, and networking resources.  At present, enterprises and Internet-based Information Technology (IT) service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers, which brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing.  The Dispersed Computing program will develop a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources.  A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements.  These dual-purposed network-compute elements will be used to eliminate bottlenecks/chokepoints, and mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data given network conditions and available network-compute elements.  With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so.</r2:Description>

Brandeis will resolve the tension between maintaining privacy and being able to tap into the huge value of data.  In the civilian sphere, there is a recognized need for technologies that enable the controlled sharing of information between commercial entities and U.S. government agencies.  Similarly, the U.S. military is increasingly involved in operations that require highly selective sharing of data with a heterogeneous mix of allies, coalition partners, and other stakeholders.  Brandeis technologies are being designed to work with the virtualization, cloud computing, and software-defined networking technologies now widely used in both civilian and military environments.</r2:Description>

DDoS attacks include both high-volume flooding attacks and more subtle low-volume attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems while exhausting server processing and memory. These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls; attackers will assimilate poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets. XD3 will develop defensive architectures that use maneuver, deception, dispersion, and on-host adaptation to increase adversary work factors, boost resilience of mission critical services such as command and control, and ultimately thwart DDoS attacks.</r2:Description>

Social engineering attacks, such as phishing and spear-phishing, typically gain user trust via impersonation to induce behaviors or elicit sensitive information that compromise security of an information system.  At present, defending against social engineering attacks falls entirely to users.  ASED aims to prevent social engineering attacks by creating counter-social-engineering bots that act on behalf of users to mediate and aggregate communications, and auto-identify attackers.  If successful, ASED will greatly reduce the effectiveness of adversary social engineering attacks and improve the security of DoD information systems.</r2:Description>

U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, but at present no tools exist to efficiently extract the right data from the right device at the right time to analyze these attacks for DoD-scale information networks. For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit would require detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack would require summary data from millions of devices. CHASE will develop novel algorithms and analysis tools to dynamically collect data from across the network, actively hunt for advanced threats that evade routine security measures, and disseminate protective measures that automatically bolster the collective cyber defense posture.</r2:Description>

The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering.  The CASE technical approach will be to formulate cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering.  CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber physical systems.  If successful, CASE technologies will enable the design of cyber physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries.</r2:Description>

The Symbiotic Cyber Operations program will develop a semi-automated cyber operations system to enable operators to create and analyze cyber effects more rapidly and accurately than unaided human operators.  The program envisions high-intensity cyber operations executed by computers under human supervision.  To accomplish this, the program will combine automated cyber defense capabilities, such as those developed in DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge, with human-centric cyber operations planning and execution capabilities, such as those developed under DARPA's Plan X program.  This technology will automatically evaluate the defensive posture of software and networks during operations; triage and verify system security issues; determine adversary intent; and guide operator responses.

The Configuration Security program will develop technologies to analyze, monitor, and modify the configuration of composed cyber-physical-human systems to identify system vulnerabilities and minimize the attack surface while maintaining functionality and performance.  Complex cyber-physical systems, such as ships, airplanes and critical infrastructure increasingly consist of commodity information technology components.  The manual configuration necessary to enable each component to interoperate introduces exploitable cyber vulnerabilities, as do the standard operating procedures that system operators follow.  The Configuration Security program will develop capabilities to automate the appropriate configuration of such systems within the operational context.  The resulting capability will ensure secure configuration settings and prevent malicious changes to these settings.</r2:Description>

Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems.</r2:Description>

The program is creating algorithms and software prototypes for use exclusively at the network edge, specifically on end hosts and/or on proxy servers fronting groups of such end hosts within a user enclave.  EdgeCT systems will sense and respond rapidly to network failures and attacks by dynamically adapting protocols utilized to exchange packets among these hosts, thereby implementing fight-through strategies that restore networked communication.  This will enable highly reliable networked communication for the military in the face of a wide variety of common network failure modes as well as cyber attacks against network infrastructure.  EdgeCT technologies are being developed in coordination with operational commands.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Supply Chain Hardware Integrity for Electronics Defense (SHIELD) program aims to develop a technology capable of confirming the authenticity of electronic parts at any time and place.  Authenticating parts or detecting counterfeit components by current means has proven expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness.  An alternative solution, maintaining complete control of the global supply chain using administrative controls, can also incur substantial costs.  SHIELD instead seeks to incorporate a small, inexpensive silicon chip ("dielet") into the packaging of genuine components.  The dielet would provide unique and encrypted component identification, enabling authentication from very close proximity.  Since counterfeit electronic components pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of both commercial and DoD systems, SHIELD would fulfill a large, pressing, and evolving need for anti-counterfeit technologies.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) program developed and demonstrated technologies to secure mission-critical embedded computing systems.  The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices are within reach at reasonable costs.  The program developed, matured, and integrated these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications.  Additionally, the program explored the use of formal methods to bring high levels of inherent assurance to Internet-enabled applications, in particular, applications involving remote update, access, management, authorization, and control.</r2:Description>

CGC technology monitored defended software and networks during operations, reasoned about flawed software, formulated effective defenses, and deployed defenses automatically.  Technologies developed and integrated included anomaly detection, Monte Carlo input generation, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CGC capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  DARPA incentivized competition through a Grand Challenge in which CGC technologies competed head-to-head.</r2:Description>

Enabling computing systems in this manner is of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act.  Incorporating these technologies in military systems will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems to perform critical missions safely and with high degrees of autonomy.  The technologies developed in this project will lay the foundation for a new generation of human-machine systems for the U.S. military.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to produce a rationale to explain the conclusions they reach.  If current trends continue, future U.S. military autonomous systems will need to perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions, and AI will be critical to such systems. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust.  Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, or not meaningful to a human user.  XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models meaningful to end-users.  XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation autonomous and decision-support systems.</r2:Description>

AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from multiple sources into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends.  If successful, AIDA will provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program is developing technology to rapidly field machine translation and other language processing capabilities for low-resource foreign languages.  The U.S. military operates globally and frequently encounters low-resource languages, i.e., languages for which few linguists are available and no automated human language technology capability exists.  Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets.  As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand.  LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources.  These capabilities will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response.</r2:Description>

Currently, the state of art for test, evaluation, verification and validation is only applicable to non-learning systems operating in well-characterized environments.  As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance.  Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, machine learning, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems.  The technologies being developed in Assured Autonomy will enable the DoD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain environments.</r2:Description>

If successful, HMS technologies will enable machines to do more than execute pre-programmed instructions.  Rather, HMS-enabled machines will understand speech; extract information contained in diverse media; learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; identify and work to fill knowledge gaps; extrapolate causal phenomena to anticipate predictable developments; respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events; and exhibit behaviors that are typically believed to require common sense.

A key DEFT emphasis is to determine explicit and implicit meaning in text through probabilistic inference, anomaly detection, and other techniques.  To accomplish this, DEFT will develop and apply formal representations for basic facts, spatial, temporal, and associative relationships, causal and process knowledge, textually entailed information, and derived relationships and correlated actions/events.  DEFT inputs may be in English or in specific foreign languages, and sources may be reports, messages, or other documents.  DEFT technologies will extract knowledge at scale for open source intelligence and threat analysis.  Transition partners include the intelligence community and operational commands.</r2:Description>

Efforts to counter existing and emerging biological, chemical and radiological threats included: countermeasures to stop the pathophysiologic processes that occur as a consequence of an attack; host immune response enhancers, medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms; collection of environmental trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological, chemical, and radiological sensors; and integrated defense systems.  This project also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Challenges in reducing U.S. vulnerability to these attacks include developing new sensors and systems that afford early warning and opportunities to interdict these threats before they can be employed in urban areas and other population centers.  A major goal of this program is to develop new sensors and sensing networks that can economically and reliably provide these wide-area monitoring capabilities for WMT threat signatures.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology program element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Advanced Tactical Technology, Aeronautics Technology and Network Centric Enabling Technology.

The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications.

The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  This project will also explore novel design technologies for the manufacture of ground vehicles and new tools for systems assessments of emerging DARPA technologies.

The Advanced Tactical Technology project focused on broad technology areas including compact, efficient, frequency-agile, diode-pumped, solid-state lasers for a variety of applications including infrared countermeasures, laser radar, holographic laser sensors, chemical sensing, communications, and high-power laser applications.

The Aeronautics Technology project will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications.

The Information Analytics Technology project develops applications for analyzing data and information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems. Technical challenges include the need to process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data in tactically-relevant timeframes. Efforts address problems related to conditioning of unstructured data, content analysis, behavioral modeling, pattern-of-life characterization, economic activity analysis, social network analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization. Operational benefits include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon. Promising technologies are evaluated in the laboratory and demonstrated in the field to facilitate transition.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long range sensors, MAD-FIRES will advance fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs.  MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned.  MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new system and as an upgrade to existing gun systems with applications to various domain platforms across a multitude of missions to include: ship self-defense, precision air to ground combat, precision ground to ground combat, counter unmanned air vehicles (C-UAV), and counter rocket and artillery and mortar (C-RAM).</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The undersea domain has significant importance to national security and military operations.  Fiber optic cables, military seabed infrastructure, mines, submarines, unmanned vehicles and oil and gas infrastructure are all within this potentially contested environment.  Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, marine fouling and corrosion.  The Lobster program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state of the art.  These robotic systems would be able to execute inspection, characterization, repair, manipulation, recharging, data exfiltration, re-tasking and other high value services without the need for continuous human control and high risk surface ship launch and recovery.  Key Lobster technical challenges include scene recognition through visual and acoustic modalities, autonomous behaviors, environmental robustness, vehicle endurance, universality for all unmanned underwater systems, energy storage and interaction with the maritime domain.  The anticipated transition is to the Navy.</r2:Description>

When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provided a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas included unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system.</r2:Description>

The goal of the Squad X program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad with substantial combat overmatch.  The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.  The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve unit level overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create an advanced, dismounted small unit.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program is to develop and demonstrate an integrated system capable of defeating a raid of self-guided small unmanned aircraft (sUAS) attacking a high value convoy on the move.  By focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program will emphasize low footprint solutions, in terms of size, weight, power (SWaP), and manning, which will benefit other counter UAS missions and result in more affordable systems.  Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to sense, decide and act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage.  The program seeks to develop solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats.  The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability.</r2:Description>

The Precision Kinetic Light Strike program will seek to develop a small, lightweight, guided kinetic weapon for lightweight maneuver forces.  Current short-range weapons are used against a variety of target sets using different munitions without the benefit of active guidance.  Current long-range weapons are highly effective against a specific target set at range, but are too large or heavy to employ in needed numbers, have a high cost per shot/procurement cost, and often require burdensome logistics or dedicated specialized systems to use.  The program goal is to improve on the existing, lightweight unguided munition systems by increasing range, accuracy, and lethality, while reducing cost.  These improvements will leverage advances in miniaturization, precision guidance and warheads.  Precision Kinetic Light Strike seeks also to take advantage of commercial technologies whenever possible to provide a low-cost, multi-use, and multi-function precision engagement capability.  The Precision Kinetic Light Strike program could significantly increase the combat power of small units with reduced burden, while significantly reducing cost relative to near-peer and peer adversaries.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly part of Urban Operations

The goal of the PDUE: Autonomous Building Search Persistent Deterrence in Urban Environments program is to generate capabilities which would allow distributed forces to operate effectively in dense urban areas (e.g. megacities).  Military operations in dense urban environments require massive investments in materiel and manpower to clear and hold terrain.  Past urban operations indicate the pressing need to maintain security of cleared areas to prevent the enemy from reoccupying or moving freely through these areas.  This program seeks to allow the ability to gain, hold, and control areas of the dense urban combat zone over extended periods without the physical presence of warfighters.  Just as police units perform presence patrols in neighborhoods to create a pervasive presence that ultimately deters crime within an area, this program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms that monitor an area overtly to deter enemy operations in a designated area.  Extending this analogy, police and military follow strict rules of engagement that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior; this program will demonstrate the capability to escalate in force to allow future operations in the presence of civilians as well as the enemy.  This mission will require the integration and maturation of novel sensors, urban air vehicles with lethal and non-lethal capabilities, and potentially ground platforms capable of navigating and maneuvering through urban environments.  Enabling capabilities would focus on enhanced tactical situational awareness, precise control of destructive and non-destructive effects, cyber- and electronic warfare robustness, and predictive capabilities to analyze avenues of approach and freedom of movement.</r2:Description>

The DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge will develop novel integrated solutions capable of mapping and navigating complex and dynamic terrains (tunnel systems, urban underground and cave networks); sensors and computation for perception in austere conditions; distributed information sharing in degraded communications environments; and collaborative autonomy enabling extended operations with minimal human interventions. The core objective of the SubT Challenge is to find the solution(s) which best outperforms current approaches for manually and laboriously mapping and searching subterranean environments. Newly developed capabilities will span across four technology focus areas in autonomy, perception, networking, and mobility technologies.  The program will increase the diversity, versatility, and robustness of relevant system technologies, capable of addressing the multi-faceted needs of a wide range of environments.  Innovations will be explored in the context of a public-facing, broadly inclusive DARPA Challenge.</r2:Description>

This program seeks to develop an advanced booster capable of delivering a variety of payloads at a variety of ranges.  Additional considerations include the need for compatible mobile ground launch platforms enabling integration with existing ground forces and infrastructure, and specific system attributes required for rapid deployment and redeployment.  The OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility, and culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests.  OpFires will leverage and integrate ongoing investments in hypersonic tactical boost glide vehicles (e.g., DARPA's Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program) to achieve these objectives.</r2:Description>

ALIAS intends to enable reduction of aircrew workload and/or the number of on-board aircrew to improve performance.  The program will develop hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interface with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems.  The program will also develop tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors.  To accomplish this, ALIAS will leverage recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS will culminate in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to multiple aircraft and execute simple missions.  This reliability enhancement capability will enable new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allow a reduction in the number of aircrew required.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Gremlins program is to develop platform technologies that enable a new class of distributed warfare.  The Gremlins concept envisions small air-launched unmanned systems that can be responsively dispatched in volley quantity from commodity platforms, fly into contested airspace, conduct a moderate duration mission, and ultimately be recovered.  Key enabling technologies for the concept include smaller developmental payloads that benefit from multiple collaborating host platforms.  The Gremlins program will conduct risk reduction and development of the host platform launch and recovery capability and develop and demonstrate a recoverable Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) platform concept.  Enabling platform technologies will include precision relative navigation, advanced computational modeling, variable geometry stores, compact propulsion systems, and high speed digital flight control.  The program will leverage these technologies, perform analytic trade studies, conduct incremental development, and ultimately demonstrate the potential for an integrated air-launched Gremlins unmanned platform.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Causal Exploration of Complex Operational Environments program is developing advanced modeling, analysis, simulation, and visualization tools to enable command staffs to rapidly and effectively design, plan and manage missions in complex, hybrid operational environments.  The U.S. military increasingly operates in remote and unstable parts of the world where mission success depends heavily on cooperation with a wide variety of stakeholder groups on civil, economic, and military matters.  These groups typically include host nation government organizations, local civilian groups, and non-governmental organizations, each of which has priorities, sensitivities and concerns that may differ significantly.  Current mission design and planning technologies do not adequately model the range of options or the inherent uncertainties.  This program will develop tools to create causal, computational models that represent the most significant relationships, dynamics, interactions, and uncertainties of the operational environment including political, military, economic, and social factors.  These tools will enable command staffs to design and quantitatively assess potential courses of action in complex operational environments.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program is developing automated model discovery techniques and tools that enable non-expert users to create empirical models of real, complex processes and phenomena.  The ability to understand the battlespace is driven increasingly by analysis of sensor and open source data.  The DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC) are fundamentally limited by a shortage of expert data scientists to construct empirical models that predict behaviors and anticipate contingencies during tactical and strategic planning.  D3M will address this need by creating technologies that automate the construction of complex empirical models.  D3M technologies will include a library of data modeling primitives that are automatically selectable; automated approaches for composition of complex models from modeling primitives; and intuitive mechanisms for human-model interaction that enable curation of models by non-experts.  D3M technical development will focus on the types of empirical modeling problems commonly encountered by the DoD and IC.</r2:Description>

The military is turning to networked weapons and sensors on-board a heterogeneous mix of multi-purpose manned and unmanned systems.  In contested environments, it is a challenge for BM networks to communicate with subordinate platforms due to extensive adversarial cyber and electronic warfare operations, anti-satellite attacks, and the need for emissions control in the face of a formidable integrated air defense system.  The Distributed Battle Management program will seek to develop a distributed command architecture with decentralized control of mission-focused asset teams.  The architecture will enable rapid reaction to ephemeral engagement opportunities and maintain a reliable BM structure, despite limited communications and platform attrition in continuously evolving threat environments.  The program will incorporate highly automated decision making capability while maintaining vital human-on-the-loop operator approval.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Modeling Adversarial Activity (MAA) program is developing technologies for generating high-confidence indications and warnings for weapons of mass terror (WMT) activities.  WMT pathways consist of networks or links among individuals, groups, organizations, and other entities that act to promote or enable the development, procurement, possession, transportation, or proliferation of WMTs and related capabilities.  Monitoring and controlling WMT pathways is essential to denying access to WMT technology, knowledge, materials, expertise, and weapons.  MAA will create graph models reflecting prototypical WMT pathways, develop methods for creating merged activity graphs by aligning entities across multiple intelligence modalities, develop algorithms to match empirical activity graphs with pathway models, and create synthetic data sets at scale to support development and testing of WMT activity detection techniques.  MAA research will be coordinated with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Memex program is developing search technologies to revolutionize the discovery, organization, and presentation of domain-specific content.  Current search technologies have limitations in search query format, retrieved content organization, and infrastructure support.  These current technologies impose an iterative search process that is time-consuming and inefficient, typically producing only a fraction of the available information.  Memex is creating a new domain-specific search paradigm to discover relevant content and organize it in ways that are more immediately useful to specific missions and tasks.  In addition, Memex domain-specific search engines will extend the reach of current search capabilities to the deep web and non-traditional content.  Memex technologies will enable the military, government, and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical information on the Internet and in large intelligence repositories.  Anticipated mission areas include counter-terrorism, counter-drug, anti-money-laundering, and anti-human-trafficking, with transition partners from DoD and other U.S. Government activities.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Materials Processing and Manufacturing thrust is exploring new manufacturing and processing approaches that will dramatically lower the cost and decrease the time required to fabricate DoD parts and systems.  It will also develop approaches that yield new materials, materials capabilities and parts that cannot be made through conventional processing approaches, as well as address efficient, low-volume manufacturing.  As a result of recent advances in manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing and manufacture on demand, and the push towards programmable hardware in embedded systems, the development cycle from design to production of both hardware and software is severely bottlenecked at the design phase.  Integration of advanced materials with superior properties into manufacturing approaches is also complex and slow, hampering new materials integration and evolution of design.  Research within this thrust will create methods to translate natural inputs into software code and mechanical design, as well as reduce manufacturing complexity through new material feedstock formats with reconfigurable processing technologies.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments, and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.

Research thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments).  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01.</r2:Description>

This program will aid the warfighter by improving immune response, minimizing inflammation, and restoring critical organ function post trauma.  One approach to achieve this capability will require the development of new tools to stimulate and measure responses of the nervous system in order to harness the bioelectric code, enabling targeted therapy without the need for pharmacological products, ultimately reducing logistical requirements.  An additional approach involves characterizing the host response in patients with severe infections, which provides a quantitative framework to guide therapy.  Algorithms will be developed to evaluate and predict various physiological conditions for military personnel.  Advances made under the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program will improve the response capabilities against severe biological threats and offer new avenues for treating disease or organ function to improve force readiness.</r2:Description>

The Defend Against Crop System Attack program will develop a platform technology aimed at increasing the speed of DoD response to state or non-state actor release of biological threats directed at our crop systems. Conventional methods to defend against these threats are generally slow and ineffective.  This program will leverage recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology to enable rapid delivery of genes to plants for large-scale trait modification, improving resilience against adversary attack or emerging natural threats.  Research within this program will develop an agnostic, scalable capability for protecting entire crop systems from emerging threats posed to food security by U.S. adversaries.</r2:Description>

This program will develop engineered biological sensor platforms capable of detecting land-based threats (e.g., chemicals, radiation, explosives) and relaying unique signals to existing DoD ground, air, and space assets.  Unlike conventional methods that passively monitor threats and are limited by sensor energy needs, these biological sensors are effectively energy independent, increasing the potential for wide distribution and environmental robustness.  Resulting platforms developed within this program will enable a variety of remote, persistent monitoring and reporting capabilities to address threat scenarios relevant for national security, including detecting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and protecting infrastructure.  These sensors will provide a flexible suite to complement conventional sensor systems within the DoD.</r2:Description>

The Transient CBRN Threat Defense program will create a transient, near immediate prophylaxis to protect military personnel against chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear (CBRN) threats.  Currently, military personnel rely on physical barrier technology (i.e., personal protective equipment) to mitigate the harmful effects of CBRN stressors.  This program will include research to develop novel transient and reversible epigenetic therapies for prophylactic and therapeutic protections against a broad range of CBRN threats (e.g., nerve agents).  In addition to overcoming constraints of traditional countermeasures to threat agents, successful work within this project will extend upon the DoD's limited protective capabilities (e.g., vaccines, anti-virals) to respond to re-emerging (e.g., Ebola, Zika), newly emerging, or engineered biothreats.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Persistent Aquatic Living Sensors program will develop novel capabilities to sense and surveil submersibles (e.g., submarines, unmanned underwater vehicles) and divers in littoral waters using living organisms present in the environment.  This effort will focus on characterizing marine biological behavior in response to targets of interest and developing the hardware, software, and algorithms that will translate organism behavior into DoD actionable information.  By harnessing the unique capabilities of biology, including adaptation, response, and replication, work in this program will enable persistent surveillance in contested waters.  Results from this research will enhance security for maritime activities and provide DoD naval operations with new sensing paradigms to complement current sensor technologies used in traditionally challenging regions across the world.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.  The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority.  The Electronic Technology project therefore supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures.  Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors.  Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards.

The Electronic Technology project will also investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful devices, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low-cost, reliable, fast, and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  Rapid design and utilization of these new technologies will be a critical focus of ELT-01, as DoD looks for mechanisms to speed the development and fielding of advanced technologies.

This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.

The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that phenomenal advancements in electronics will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, presenting a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include leveraging materials, architectures, and designs that are designed to suit a specific need. Programs within the Beyond Scaling Technology project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware. They will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit  architectures, for instance by exploiting chip-scale heterogeneous integration of differing material technologies, using "sticky logic" devices that combine computation and memory functions, and vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices. This Project is not a new start. It aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in PEs/Projects 0602716E/ELT-01 and 0602303E/IT-02 and IT-03.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority.  The Electronic Technology project therefore supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures.  Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors.  Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards.

The Electronic Technology project will also investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful devices, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low-cost, reliable, fast, and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  Rapid design and utilization of these new technologies will be a critical focus of ELT-01, as DoD looks for mechanisms to speed the development and fielding of advanced technologies.

This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications and sensing systems.  HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  Opportunities for transferring HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the execution of the early phases of the program.  Technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The WIRED program addresses the need for low-cost, high-performance imaging sensors in the short-wave and mid-wave infrared (SWIR/MWIR) bands.  These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.  WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time.  Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in the Long-Wave Infrared Thermal (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available.  However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR/MWIR bands.  WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR/MWIR.  The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art.</r2:Description>

These systems enable applications such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), laser communications, laser illumination, navigation, and 3D imaging.  Specifically, MOABB will construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices.  These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems.  MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components.  These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in the steering rate of optical systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) program aims to develop extremely stable chip-scale atomic clocks for unmanned aerial vehicles and other low size, weight, and power (SWaP) platforms with extended mission durations.  Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare (EW); and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled.  By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations.  ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments.  Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) program aims to demonstrate long-wave infrared (LWIR) detector technologies with both high performance and low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C).  The resulting technologies would enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems.  Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and low response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP-C reductions at lower performance.  LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger cameras in terms of higher sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and lower response time required to avoid image blur.  These technologies will allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets.</r2:Description>

Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities.  Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers.  DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of a ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers.  The program could lead to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, and high-resolution detection of chemical/biological threats at a distance.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program will develop novel magnetic sensors capable of providing high-sensitivity signal measurements in the presence of ambient magnetic fields.  In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis.  Practical application, however, has been limited.  Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities.  The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources.  The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal.  This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications.  In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and Ultralow Frequency (ULF) communications.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) program aims to develop intrinsically linear (ideal) radio frequency (RF) transistors with improved power efficiency and extremely high dynamic range.  Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals. Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  Traditional RF transistor designs typically require a trade-off between linearity and broadcast power, and poor linearity results in undesired interference.  DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new transistor materials, architectures, and designs.  The resulting DREAM-enabled technologies will allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum and while consuming less system power.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Wireless Autonomous Vehicle Power Transfer (WAVPT) program will develop small footprint, efficient receivers to enable power beaming from a ground-based transmitter to a remote unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  UAVs are currently powered by large, heavy chemical batteries or an engine, with associated liquid fuel.  This consumes a large percentage of the UAV's weight budget and places strict limitations on its range.  Wireless power transfer represents a paradigm-changing solution to power distribution by alleviating the need to carry all energy sources on-board, drastically reducing UAV weight, and increasing aircraft endurance.  Additional power can also be made available for the UAV's payload, allowing use of higher-functionality sensing and computing systems and enabling better data exploitation and threat response.  Previous wireless power transfer experiments have demonstrated delivery of over 30 kilowatts of power over a distance of one kilometer but have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitively large, meter-sized receivers required.  WAVPT will leverage recent advances in directed energy sources and beam-forming capabilities and develop new receiver architectures to demonstrate efficient wireless power transfer in a small form-factor.  Advanced semiconductor materials and processing techniques will be used to develop low-cost, centimeter-sized receivers with high efficiency and energy densities, enabling integration within a small platform.  The program will culminate with a demonstration of hundreds of watts of power being transferred from a ground-based transmitter to a UAV at least one kilometer away.  The technology that is developed within this program can break the inherent tradeoff between mission duration and weight for unmanned vehicles and transform next-generation military systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop standardized, fully digital phased array system components to enable rapid upgrades to DoD communications, electronic warfare, and radar systems.  Phased arrays, which control and steer radio signals, have helped the DoD maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict.  However, current phased array components are based on custom analog electronics, making them expensive to develop, difficult to upgrade, and time-consuming to deploy.  ACT will address this challenge by leveraging programmable, commercial-off-the-shelf, digital components that can undergo yearly technology refreshes in response to a continually changing threat environment.  This approach can dramatically reduce the time and cost required to develop and update DoD phased arrays.  Further, the ongoing cost reductions and performance improvements typical in the commercial sector could enable the DoD to place phased arrays on inexpensive platforms such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles where they have previously proven prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain.</r2:Description>

Goals of the ART program included (1) developing a technology base enabling future radios to survey and adapt to the electromagnetic environment; (2) enabling the rapid deployment of radios in response to changing operational requirements; and (3) significantly reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of such radios.  ART enabled the use of a single design pathway for multiple, unique radio frequency (RF) systems, thus dramatically reducing military procurement and sustainment costs.  ART also advanced the hardware and software used in radio frequency (RF) systems by developing a flexible, reconfigurable architecture that can adapt to various RF waveforms.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) program developed the design and manufacturing capabilities required to seamlessly integrate various semiconductors, microelectromechanical systems, photonic (light-manipulating) devices, and thermal management structures into true systems-on-a-chip (SOC).  This capability enabled dramatic size, weight, and volume reductions and higher performance for DoD electronic warfare, communications, and radar systems.  Historically, chip designers had to decide between the availability, development, and low cost of silicon circuits or the high performance of compound semiconductor (CS) materials.  DAHI, however, built on previous DARPA and commercial efforts, which demonstrated that heterogeneously integrating CS and silicon can yield significant performance improvements over silicon or CS alone.  DAHI's applied research program focused on developing and demonstrating high-performance SOC for DoD-specific applications.  The program also enhanced the manufacturing yield and reliability of heterogeneous integration capabilities and demonstrated innovative, advanced microsystems that leveraged heterogeneous integration.  Relevant manufacturing processes were made available to a wide variety of designers from the DoD laboratories, federally funded research and development centers, academia, and industry.  This program had advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program created microelectronic and mechanical systems capable of physically vanishing in a controlled, triggerable manner.  This advance helped avoid problems associated with unrecovered devices, including their potential use by unauthorized individuals and the compromise of intellectual property.  The resulting technologies enabled a range of applications including vanishing sensors for monitoring large areas of the environment and transient airborne vehicles for emergency resupply without requiring pack out of the air delivery vehicle.  To support this new class of electronics and mechanical structures, VAPR developed and established an initial set of transient materials and components along with the required manufacturing processes.  The resulting systems performed comparably to commercial-off-the-shelf systems while demonstrating system transience that can be programmed, adjusted, triggered, or made to respond to the deployment environment.  VAPR technologies were demonstrated through two final test platforms.  A vanishing air delivery vehicle capable of precise, gentle drops of small payloads (~3 lbs.)  demonstrated the feasibility of transient structural materials.  A sensor with a wireless link demonstrated the manufacturability of transient electronics.  Both demonstrations were intended to fully function on their own and to serve as a leading indicator of the potential systems and concepts-of-operation that VAPR could enable.</r2:Description>

CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in the form of prefabricated chiplets.  The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years.  Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.  A basic research component is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) program will develop novel integrated circuit (IC) design flows to reduce by ten times the design and verification effort required for high-performance military electronics.  CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months.  The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics.  To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies.  These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs.  CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes.  Finally, CRAFT will develop and validate various techniques for obscuring sensitive information during the IC manufacturing process, allowing DoD to leverage more of the available onshore semiconductor market.  These capabilities can help to ensure that the DoD has multiple potential suppliers for critical ICs and help keep military electronics at the leading edge.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will demonstrate the integration of novel materials into next-generation logic and memory components.  Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  This program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  Research areas will include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, "sticky logic" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies.  The program aims to demonstrate the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system.  Previous DARPA work on unconventional computing, integration, and reprogrammable memory give confidence in this approach.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Architectures and Designs program will significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics hardware.  As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics cost, speed, and power derived from silicon scaling, the DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies by using design tools that enable circuit specialization. This program will develop and demonstrate the tools required for rapidly designing and deploying specialized circuits. Research efforts will explore technologies and techniques such as new domain-specific circuit architectures; co-design of electronics hardware and software; tight integration of chip-scale processing blocks and artificial intelligence-enabled processing controllers; and open-source circuit designs.  Further research will also develop tools to create exact representations of outdated hardware in the field and to rapidly, cheaply, and safely upgrade these systems with next-generation electronics.  Two fundamental goals of this program include (1) reduce the barrier to entry for Complex System on a Chip (SoC) design and (2) manage the utilization of the specialized hardware by enabling the writing of a common code base on top of the customized hardware.  Advances under this program will demonstrate a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide benefits by improving electronics systems that do not depend on continued rapid improvements in silicon transistors.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that phenomenal advancements in electronics will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, presenting a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include leveraging materials, architectures, and designs that are designed to suit a specific need. Programs within the Beyond Scaling project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware. They will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit  architectures, for instance by exploiting chip-scale heterogeneous integration of differing material technologies, using "sticky logic" devices that combine computation and memory functions, and vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices. This Project is not a new start. It aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in PEs/Projects 0602716E/ELT-01 and 0602303E/IT-02 and IT-03.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will demonstrate the integration of novel materials into next-generation logic and memory components.  Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  This program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  Research areas will include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, "sticky logic" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies.  The program aims to demonstrate the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system.  Previous DARPA work on unconventional computing, integration, and reprogrammable memory give confidence in this approach.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-02.</r2:Description>

CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in the form of prefabricated chiplets.  The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program seeks to secure DoD and commercial electronic systems against cybersecurity threats by developing novel hardware/firmware security architectures and hardware design methodologies.  Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program will pursue new hardware architectures and algorithms for rapidly integrating information from a variety of sources, increasing battlefield situational awareness.  To develop operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today watch live battlefield feeds to detect items of interest, fusing together and interpreting information from multiple sensors and sources.  The amount of information gathered, however, is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.  Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlefield in real time.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) program will develop novel integrated circuit (IC) design flows to reduce by ten times the design and verification effort required for high-performance military electronics.  CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months.  The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics.  To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies.  These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs.  CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes.  Finally, CRAFT will develop and validate various techniques for obscuring sensitive information during the IC manufacturing process, allowing DoD to leverage more of the available onshore semiconductor market.  These capabilities can help to ensure that the DoD has multiple potential suppliers for critical ICs and help keep military electronics at the leading edge.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years.  Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.  A basic research component is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Ensured Communication Link for Identification Friend or Foe (ECLIFF) program aims to provide communication links for Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capabilities with a reduced radio frequency (RF) signature, improved performance against jamming and interference, and a compact form factor.  ECLIFF will address the challenge of identifying friendly assets and personnel in congested electromagnetic environments and in environments where there is a strong penalty for stray radio emissions.  The current IFF system operates with a limited instantaneous RF bandwidth (IBW), which makes hiding signals from adversaries difficult and leaves the system vulnerable to jamming and interference.  ECLIFF will explore alternative technologies to enable ~25 times greater IBW. These technologies should also enable IFF systems to use alternate channels at higher frequency bands.  The resulting ECLIFF system could employ DARPA-developed technologies such as high-speed data converters, heterogeneous integration, and envelope-tracking transmitter technology.  The novel combination of these technologies in the final ECLIFF system will be critical for dramatic size, weight, power, and cost reduction and performance improvements.  The miniaturization realized with the ECLIFF platform should make the capability useful for both large platforms and portable applications such as unmanned air vehicle, man-portable, and even hand-held devices.  The ECLIFF program will culminate with a demonstration of the technology in a relevant environment, lowering the risk for transition to a fielded system.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Digital RF Battlespace Emulator (DRBE) program aims to develop a large-scale, interactive, emulated radiofrequency (RF) environment, providing DoD with the much needed capability to cost-effectively evaluate adaptive, intelligent, and spatially distributed next-generation RF systems.  Current U.S. test infrastructure is no longer able to successfully exercise RF systems in relevant environments, which should account for hundreds of DoD systems coordinating against hundreds of adversary systems.  Due to the critical dependency of nearly all platforms and missions on the RF spectrum and the increasingly advanced RF capabilities of peer adversaries, current infrastructure limitations represent a critical capability gap.  Existing test approaches are either: 1) small-scale laboratory tests under well controlled but unrealistic conditions or 2) massive training exercises, which occur at most annually due to the required cost and manpower and do not fully collect necessary data.  To overcome these limitations, DRBE will leverage advances in massively multi-core computing hardware and high-bandwidth digital cross connects to emulate realistic RF environments that account for RF platform movement, signal propagation effects and delays, signal interference, and interactions between RF systems.  DRBE will pursue three technical thrust areas: architecture, massively multi-core computing, and scenario modeling.  The resulting test environment should allow plug-and-play connections for hundreds of RF systems in a 100 km battlespace test.  Multi-system exercises could then be quickly executed through many different combat scenarios and variations, with RF systems employing war reserve modes forbidden during open-air testing.  DRBE should therefore serve to develop CONOPS, inform battle plans, and fine-tune the performance of both individual and large groups of RF systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program is to enhance mission performance, reduce cost, confound adversaries, and reduce reliance on space assets for navigation and communication by distributing mission functions such as sensing, communication, precision navigation, kinetic, and non-kinetic effects to small platforms and increasing their level of autonomy.  Collaboration of multiple assets offers new possibilities to conduct military missions using smaller air platforms to enhance survivability, reduce overall acquisition cost, create new effects, increase communications range and robustness in denied environments, increase search area, increase areas held at risk, reduce target prosecution reaction time, and provide multi-mission capabilities by combinations of assets.  This effort will specifically focus on developing and demonstrating approaches that will expand the mission capabilities of legacy air assets through autonomy and collaborative behaviors, within a standard based open architecture.  Potential transition partners include the Air Force, Army, and Navy.</r2:Description>

The program will also consider traceability, compatibility, and integration with the Navy Vertical Launch System (VLS).  The metrics associated with this objective include total range, time of flight, payload, accuracy, and impact velocity.  The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a hypersonic boost glide system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic and aero-thermal performance, controllability and robustness for a wide operational envelope, (2) the system attributes and subsystems required to be effective in relevant operational environments, and (3) approaches to reducing cost and improving affordability for both the demonstration system and future operational systems.  TBG capabilities are planned for transition to the Air Force and the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Operational Fires (OpFires) program is to develop and demonstrate a novel ground-launched system enabling advanced weapons to penetrate modern enemy air defenses and rapidly and precisely engage critical time sensitive targets.  This program seeks to develop an advanced booster capable of delivering a variety of payloads at a variety of ranges.  Additional considerations include the need for compatible mobile ground launch platforms enabling integration with existing ground forces and infrastructure, and specific system attributes required for rapid deployment and redeployment.  The OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility, and culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests.  OpFires will leverage and integrate ongoing investments in hypersonic tactical boost glide vehicles (e.g., DARPA s Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program) to achieve these objectives.  In FY18, this program was funded from PE 0602702E, Project TT-07.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Aircraft and Vehicle IntegrAted Team (AVIATE) program will design, develop and demonstrate an advanced capability Unmanned Air System (UAS) that is an organic extension of tactical ground vehicles.  Current fielded UAS systems require significant infrastructure and manpower to launch and recover, exposing friendly troops to threats while stationary.  As a result, small units suffer degraded situational awareness with no overhead capability or delays in air support.  A UAS that is an integrated subsystem of a ground vehicle with features to autonomously land, attach, stow, detach, and take-off from its parent ground vehicle while it is on the move would enable on-demand capabilities and drastically improved protection.  Ground vehicles could perform traditional UAS missions such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and fires support, as well as unique missions such as electronic attack, sensor emplacement, infrastructure attack, and active protection without having to rely on brigade and theater level assets.  This effort will explore design interfaces between the air and ground vehicle, attributes to allow for launch and recovery on the move, and design considerations to enable operations in contested environments.  The Army, Navy and Marines are all seeking UAS designs to meet their expeditionary needs and provide runway independence.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program, a joint effort with the Office of Naval Research, is to develop a systems approach for, and perform technical demonstration of, a Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MALE UAV) capability from smaller ships.  The program will demonstrate the technology for launch and recovery of large unmanned aircraft capable of providing persistent 24/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  By extending the ISR/strike radius and simultaneously increasing time on station beyond current capabilities from smaller ships, TERN will enable novel operational concepts including maritime surveillance and responsive, persistent deep overland ISR and strike, without requirement for forward basing.  To achieve these goals, the program will create new concepts for aircraft launch and recovery, aircraft logistics and maintenance, and aircraft flight in regimes associated with maritime operating conditions.  The program will culminate in a launch and recovery demonstration.  Application of TERN technologies and operational concepts will enable a novel and cost efficient approach for multiple mission sets.  The transition partner is the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Current and future land and ship-to-shore operations require rapid and distributed employment of U.S. forces on the battlefield.  The Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES) program developed a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), modular unmanned air vehicle that can carry a 3,000 lb. useful load at a range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel.  ARES will enable distributed operations and access to compact, high altitude landing zones to reduce warfighter exposure to hostile threats and bypass ground obstructions.  ARES modular capability allows for mission modules to be quickly interchanged and deployed at the company level.  This enables the flexible employment of many different capabilities including: cargo resupply, casualty evacuation, reconnaissance, weapons platforms, and other types of operations.  ARES vehicles could be dispatched to resupply isolated small units.  ARES is well suited for enhanced company operations concepts that would provide the warfighter/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.  The enabling technologies of interest developed under the ARES program included vertical and translational flight, conversion between powered lift and wing borne lift, ducted fan propulsion systems, lightweight materials, tailless configuration, modularity, and advanced over-actuated flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  Additionally, the program explored opportunities for the design, development, and integration of new, key technologies and capabilities.  These included adaptable landing gear concepts to enable operations from irregular landing zones and moving launch/recovery platforms, and autonomous take off and landing.  ARES is transitioning to the Marine Corps.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions.

A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets.  The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.

Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; unique manufacturing or assembly processes, and precision control of multi-payload systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the XSP program is to develop and flight demonstrate a prototype booster and expendable upper stage with responsive aircraft-like operations.  Past efforts have identified and demonstrated critical enabling technologies including composite or lightweight structures, propellant tanks, thermal protection systems, rocket propulsion and advanced avionics/software.  A critically important technology gap is integration into a flight demonstration able to deliver aircraft-like operability.  The program will validate key technologies on the ground, and then fabricate an X-Plane to demonstrate: 1) 10 flights in 10 days, 2) design the objective system for >3000-lb payload at a reduced cost, 3) fly the demonstration system one time with an orbital payload of 900-lbs, and 4) fly to a high staging speed (Mach 3-10).  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force, Navy and commercial sector.</r2:Description>

The enabling technologies of interest are extremely lightweight and space capable deployable antenna structures.  Current deployable antenna options have not been sufficiently developed to be dependable on small payload launches, leaving current capabilities trending to large and more costly satellite systems.  These satellite systems are expected to have long operational lifetimes, which can leave them behind the pace of state-of-the-art technical developments.  The technologies developed under Radar Net will enable small, low-cost sensor payloads on short timescales with rapid technology refresh capabilities.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), providing persistence and enabling ground station antennas to point in a fixed direction.  Technologies for servicing of GEO spacecraft would involve a mix of highly automated and remotely operated (from Earth) robotic systems.  The Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program seeks to establish the capability to acquire robotic services in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners and national security space operators, and with sufficient propellant for several years of follow-on capability.  Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams.  The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer.  To support the development of a broadly accepted satellite servicing capability, DARPA is using the consortium for execution of rendezvous and servicing operations (CONFERS) approach to bring together experts from the private sector and Government to develop and publish non-binding, consensus-based standards for safe operational approaches.</r2:Description>

The Blackjack program will develop space technologies demonstrating a proliferated smallsat constellation capability in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  Capabilities demonstrated will provide constant custody of very large numbers of concurrent targets; target identification, tracking, and characterization; architectural resilience via massive proliferation; and rapid on-orbit technology refresh and experimentation.  Blackjack will leverage commercial industry plans to build constellations in LEO to provide global commercial broadband internet service.  Key efforts include low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) multi-modality smallsat sensor payloads, algorithms for autonomous payload and architecture command and control, algorithms for satellite on-board processing and data fusion, and advanced manufacturing for military payload mass production.

In order to increase resolution, conventional telescopes have to grow in size and weight.  The Planar Imager program will eliminate this constraint by using computational interferometric techniques to replace conventional optics with digital processing, providing dramatic improvements in weight and enabling novel form factors for military imaging systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Advances in technology, including networking and computing, have significantly increased the utility of small (&lt;300kg) spacecraft that would previously have been of limited military value. For the simultaneous purposes of responsiveness and resiliency, these spacecraft are envisioned to be built on dramatically faster timelines (weeks instead of years) than are executed today. The current practice for space launch generally favors large launch vehicles with complex, one-of-a-kind infrastructure. This architecture has been matched to the large, heavy spacecraft, which compose most of DoD's space architecture today. Small spacecraft, which offer large potential value for resiliency and tactical employment, are typically required to rideshare for access to space which requires programmatic, technical, and schedule entanglement with other programs. The U.S. commercial sector has promising developments for small launch vehicles that are designed for launch on rapid timescales with minimal fixed infrastructure. To incentivize industry to deliver capability that can meet emerging DoD needs for rapid, responsive launch of small payloads, the DARPA Launch Challenge will reward competitors who can demonstrate the ability to launch a payload to orbit with minimal notification time and unknown pre-conditions regarding the payload configuration, required orbit, and launch site. The U.S. Government can make future use of commercial contracting mechanisms for rapid space launch with successful performers. The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and NASA.</r2:Description>

A major goal of the SST program, to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance has been achieved.  This capability enables ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The SST Australia effort developed advanced algorithms, equipment, and concepts of operation to achieve comparable telescope performance in the more challenging Australian atmosphere.  This enhanced capability was demonstrated at White Sands Missile Range, allowing estimates of the performance in Australia to be validated.  This program addressed technical challenges which arise from an Australian site, including adaptations to a different telescope environment.  The system, algorithms, and concepts of operation transitioned to Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronics Technologies program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and  microelectronic devices, sensor systems, integrated photonic-electronic components that have military applications and potential commercial utility. Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.

The Mixed Technology Integration project funds the advanced development and demonstration of selected basic and applied electronics research programs.  Examples of technologies with funded development and demonstration activities include, but are not limited to: (1) self-contained laser weapon systems to protect airborne platforms from emerging surface-to-air missiles; (2) integrated photonic-electronic components for positioning, navigation and timing in GPS-denied environments; (3) flexible, software-defined cameras that enable real-time image analysis of complex scenes to provide more actionable information; and (4) component programs that integrate mixed signal (analog and digital) or mixed semiconductor technology to substantially improve the capability of existing components and/or reduce their size, weight and power.  Funding under this project is intended to advance transitioning novel technologies to use, providing advanced components compatible with mid-term and other future warfighting requirements.

The Beyond Scaling Advanced Technologies project is a continuation of DARPA's basic and applied research in this area and will support activities in large scale co-development with leading industry players to enable and accelerate transformative computing interactions with industry. Additionally, funding under this project is intended to secure the design and capture of advanced intellectual property (IP) and architectures, IP sharing and re-use, and limited access to state-of-the-art (SOTA) and state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries for microelectronics fabrication runs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems.  Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process and relay image information. This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC.  Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates.  These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame.  Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements.  Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame.  The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs.  Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information.  The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band.  By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs should enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Rapid Array Development (RAD) program seeks to leverage recent developments in flexible and adaptive radio frequency (RF) hardware, access to a larger variety of more powerful computing platforms, and advances in software virtualization to radically change the development and deployment cycle for electromagnetic (EM) arrays. EM arrays, which enable communications, radar and electronic warfare (EW), are currently high performance but slow and costly to create.  In contrast, they must evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats.  However, the available design and test infrastructure is not flexible enough to support testing and fielding new EM array algorithms across a wide variety of military platforms.  Furthermore, EM software and hardware are often developed in separate silos; as a result, implementing new EM applications in hardware tends to require a lengthy and expensive development process with extended cycles of iteration between the two areas.  RAD will therefore focus on three core areas: (1) making ultra-flexible testbeds for existing and future EM arrays accessible to the DoD community; (2) reducing the complexity of phased array hardware through high level abstraction; and (3) speeding up EM system development time through hardware/software co-design.  In light of changing requirements, the resulting technologies would also enable DoD greater reuse of its available hardware resources while minimizing the need to modify specialized EM systems, leading to improved and simplified upgrade cycles.  Technologies developed under the RAD program are planned for transition to the services through a series of demonstrations proving the radically shorter time scale of development.</r2:Description>

The Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) program will develop a common millimeter wave phased-array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18-50 GHz with element-level digital beamforming.  Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor.  We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35.  One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile.  This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery and when transmitting, multiple beams can be used to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously.  This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages.  To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block.  The program will be executed in two primary technical areas.  First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems.  Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Efficient Ultra-Compact Laser-Integrated Diodes (EUCLID) program aims to significantly reduce the size of laser diode pump modules (DPMs) while increasing their electrical-to-optical efficiency.  DPMs are a critical component of fiber-laser array weapons systems, which combine light from many lower-power lasers to engage targets at tactically-relevant distances.  Commercial DPMs, which cater to the laser manufacturing industry, feature large cooling systems and are too cumbersome for integration into many small DoD platforms.  EUCLID plans to leverage advances in thermal management components to design, build, test, and demonstrate densely packageable, prototype DPMs that are less than half the size of their commercial counterparts.  The program will also pursue improved optical components that can more efficiently focus light from individual laser diodes.  The resulting EUCLID DPMs are intended to be available for procurement and integration into ultra-low size, weight, and power fiber-laser array weapons systems, enabling integration into a variety of Air Force, Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency platforms.</r2:Description>

With its modular, scalable architecture, future systems could be built with output power levels in the hundreds of kilowatts, enabling a broad set of offensive mission capabilities, many of which are not possible with current technology.  To accomplish its program goals, FLASH pursued two major thrusts.  First, FLASH greatly reduced the size and weight of high-power fiber laser amplifiers, increased their power efficiency and improve their resistance to shock, vibration and acoustic stresses found on military platforms.  Second, FLASH fabricated an array of these amplifiers and integrated them into a transportable system with advanced battery power, thermal management and coherent-beam combination sub-systems.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) program developed the design and manufacturing capabilities required to seamlessly integrate various semiconductors, microelectromechanical systems, photonic (light-manipulating) devices and thermal management structures into true systems-on-a-chip (SOC).  This capability enabled dramatic size, weight and volume reductions and higher performance for DoD electronic warfare, communications and radar systems.  Historically, chip designers have had to decide between the availability, development and low cost of silicon circuits or the high performance of compound semiconductor (CS) materials.  DAHI, however, built on previous DARPA and commercial efforts, which demonstrated that heterogeneously integrating CS and silicon can yield significant performance improvements over silicon or CS alone.  DAHI's advanced technology development effort focused on establishing a technologically mature manufacturing path for integrating a wide array of materials and devices, including CS, on a common substrate.  Relevant manufacturing processes are made available to a wide variety of designers from the DoD laboratories, federally funded research and development centers, academia and industry.  DAHI supported demonstrating increasingly complex circuits that leverage heterogeneous integration.  DAHI technologies are intended for transition to national security and semiconductor manufacturing partners.  This program has applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Access program will demonstrate the design and fabrication of advanced electronics through collaborations with leading industry players. Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics since its inception and is home to three of the five leading-edge foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD has led to a cost barrier in meeting its future technology needs. In some cases, the inability to place orders in volume has created a lack of access to advanced technology nodes entirely. To address this, the DoD must participate in more industry partnerships that not only leverage investments in the commercial industry but also provide access to SOTA facilities in the U.S. This program will build on existing relationships and forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD. Activities include securing advanced IP and electronics architectures, IP sharing and re-use, and limited access to SOTA and SOTP foundries for microelectronics fabrication runs.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Radio Frequency Collaborative Unmanned Distributed System (RF CLOUDS)

The Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) program will develop a common millimeter wave phased-array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18-50 GHz with element-level digital beamforming.  Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor.  We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35.  One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile.  This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery and when transmitting, multiple beams can be used to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously.  This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages.  To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block.  The program will be executed in two primary technical areas.  First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems.  Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

The success of military operations depends on timely, reliable, secure, and synchronized dissemination of command and control and relevant situational awareness information to every military echelon. While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users. The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces. Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:
- High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability.
- Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, and scalability.
- Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in very high-threat environments.
- Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users.  The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.  Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:
-  High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability.
-  Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, and scalability.
-  Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in very high-threat environments.
-  Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters/features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations.  The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability.  The Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Federal Government is working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications.  The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked data/sensor capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor/radar bands.  The program will leverage technical trends in cooperative sharing to exploit radar anti-jam and interference mitigation technologies that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems, and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program will be made available to the Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA).</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield is driving a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms.  The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking requirements of deployed military forces.  DARPA's hybrid Free Space Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system has broken the 10 Gb/s wireless network boundary using free-space optical links, but all-weather Ku band components are currently limited to much less than 1Gb/s capacity.  Furthermore, the hybrid optical/RF system exhibits size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption characteristics that preclude deployment on many SWaP-limited platforms.  Moving to a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency, but presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers.  This program seeks to develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gb/s backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current ORCA system.  The 100 Gb/s RF Backbone program is intended for transition to multiple Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Geospatial Cloud Analytics (GCA) program will develop technology to access and analyze global scale, multimodal geospatial data and pilot an analytics-as-a-service business model.  Exploiting multiple sources and modalities at a global scale requires the development of technologies and systems that provide common access points to commercial data, computational power to preprocess data and make it exploitable by analytical tools, and new models supporting sensing and analytics as services including sharing of tools and results between individuals and consortiums.  GCA creates a capability for near real time monitoring of global events and change detection across various environments and warfighting domains, building upon the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) coalition warfighter information sharing program, also in this Program Element.  By exploiting the vast amounts of geospatial information from new commercial satellite constellations and other sources, GCA will create the technology foundations needed to provide global awareness of gray-zone activities.  It will do so by augmenting commercial capabilities with defense assets, not vice versa, and thereby improve speed, agility, and scalability.  Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies to meet their needs for global situational awareness.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link.  This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades.  In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take more than two minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established.  During these network outages, data transmission is not possible.  Building on technologies explored in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also in this PE, the Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments.  Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost.  The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links.  The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons.  These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command.  The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries.  This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links.  The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication system to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation.  PFC builds on technology developed in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also in this Program Element.  PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC).  The PFC program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Communication in Contested Environments (C2E) program will seek to address communications problems anticipated in networked airborne systems in the mid-21st century. Expected growth in sensor systems, unmanned systems, and internetworked weapons systems will strain the size of networks that our current communications technology can support in the contested environment.  As adversary capabilities advance, the DoD will need new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability.  As part of Advanced Networking technologies efforts, the C2E program addresses these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, to develop heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems.  Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Anti-Jam (AJ), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols will be developed.  Second, to create a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that draws from commercial communication architectures.  The defense contractor community can build specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture.  Finally, C2E will create a government controlled development environment to allow rapid refresh of communications technology and allow third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies.  Technologies from this program are planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of collection assets and the required level of signal processing inhibits our capability to pervasively sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action.  To address these Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) challenges, the Advanced RF Mapping program developed and demonstrated new concepts for sensing and manipulating the RF environment based on distributed rather than centralized collection.  This approach took advantage of the proliferation of RF devices, such as radios and cell phones, on the battlefield.  To leverage these existing devices effectively, the program developed new algorithms that map the RF environment with minimal communication load between devices.  The Advanced RF Mapping program also developed approaches to exploit our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of RF devices to provide reliable and assured communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks.  The Advanced RF Mapping program enabled both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments.  Advanced RF Mapping technology transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

Accomplishing this depends on providing reliable wireless communications to all U.S. forces, platforms, and devices in all phases of conflict.  As part of the Advanced Networks technologies effort, the Wireless Network Defense program increased wireless network capacity and reliability for tactical users, with the ultimate vision of making high quality data services pervasive throughout the DoD.  The primary focus was mitigation of advanced threats particular to the security of wireless networks.  The program leveraged the capabilities of the dynamic network to identify sources of misinformation, whether malicious or due to poor configuration, across the functional components of the complex system, and mitigated the corresponding effects.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.

The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  

The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program seeks to implement an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments.  Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to properly leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities.  The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to further streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment.  To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications) while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification, as well as tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) techniques.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic replanning capability, and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  The RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The System-of-Systems-Enhanced Small Unit (SESU) program will develop and demonstrate adaptive kill-web capabilities based on a system-of-systems architecture that enables a small unit of U.S. forces to prevail against a much larger near-peer adversary force in a contested environment. SESU-developed capabilities will provide the small unit with improved awareness of enemy force composition, disposition, and intent.  It will also provide the means to deter escalation of threat, and, if deterrence fails, the ability to destroy enemy combat systems.  The goal of the fight will be to push enemy decision makers beyond loss tolerance before they achieve operational objectives.  Technologies to accomplish this include command, control, &amp; communications (C3) that operate in a contested environment and interoperate with host-nation forces; distributed sensing, including the ability to leverage indigenous information sources; and hybrid effects that include a mix of kinetic, non-kinetic, and information operations capabilities.  A major thrust within the SESU program will be systems architecture and technology to enable manned-unmanned teaming with a focus on C3 and autonomy of the unmanned platforms.  SESU technologies will be integrated using system-of-systems principles developed under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, also budgeted in this Program Element/Project.  A Campaign of Learning (CoL) will be conducted in partnership with the Army, and technologies produced by this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

PROTEUS will provide the tools and automation to enable small tactical units to compose force packages optimized to specific urban combat objectives and challenges.  These tools will support planning and force composition for all missions relevant to the urban environment: command &amp; control, fires, maneuver, logistics, intelligence, force protection, and medical.  PROTEUS will be adaptive to an inherently dynamic and fluid environment that will extend to the social complexity of urban combat as well as kinetic warfighting.  Technologies will be integrated using systems of systems principles developed under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, also budgeted in this Program Element/Project.  To support concept development, testing, and warfighter interaction, the program will also develop a supporting virtual testbed.

                                                    <r2:Description>Worldwide advancements in signal processing and electronics have decreased the effectiveness of single-platform, power-based Electronic Warfare (EW) as a viable technique in the future.  The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program is to develop and demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to direct high-power spatially resolved radio frequency (RF) beams to a single location.  ReACT will achieve this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single aperture.  The key technical challenge is to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  The ReACT system will sense the target's emissions and then optimally configure the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area of interest.  The ReACT technology is planned to transition to the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships, and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them, and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

By exploiting promising new developments in unmanned platforms, seafloor systems, and emerging long-range weapon systems, the program will develop an advanced, integrated undersea and above sea warfighting capability.  The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program will establish an analytical and experimental environment to explore architecture combinations in terms of operational effectiveness as well as engineering feasibility and robustness.  The program will leverage enabling technologies needed for command, control, and communication (C3) between physical domains in order to support the architecture constructs.  Through experimentation, the program will not only demonstrate integrated system performance, but also develop new tactics that capitalize on features created by the heterogeneous architecture.  The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program will invest in technologies that will reduce cost, manage complexity, and improve reliability.

The MOCCA program will nullify submarine signature reduction trends with active sonar projectors deployed from a mobile unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) and cooperatively processed with onboard submarine acoustic receive sonar systems.  The off-board UUV sonar projector will operate, under positive control, at a significant distance from the cooperative submarine using communication links. The program seeks to achieve breakthrough capability for long-range submarine detection and precision target tracking.  The program will develop compact, high output acoustic transducers and novel low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) communication signaling.  In addition, the MOCCA system will be integrated into submarine onboard sonar and weapons control systems.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) program will provide continuous, Global Positioning System (GPS)-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in ocean basins over extended periods of time.  Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around the ocean basin.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain, maintain, and re-acquire, if lost, an initial location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus trilaterate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Systems fighting as a network are vulnerable to a loss of connectivity in a contested environment.  This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operating standards; and rapid, cost effective deployment technologies.  The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to temporarily restore connectivity for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will emphasize early risk reduction with future scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) program will provide the capability to coherently combine acoustic energy from a distributed network of underwater acoustic sources to improve signal transmission in an undersea environment.  The ability to cohere multiple underwater sensors will have a transformative impact on a number of compelling applications including surveillance, communications, and vehicle positioning.  For all of these applications, coherent sensor gain is currently achieved by deploying large, costly, and cumbersome cabled arrays.  Based on technologies explored in the Mobile Offboard C2 and Attack (MOCCA) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, the TEAC program will create the opportunity to deploy groups of low unit-cost sources that work cooperatively and semi-autonomously to focus energy undersea.  This concept would provide an extensible, affordable, and flexible method to harness the rapid development of undersea vehicles, ocean energy sources, and new acoustic source technologies.  Technologies developed under this program are intended to transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

Ocean of Things builds upon advances made in the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program, which is also in this Program Element.  Ocean of Things will develop large numbers of heterogeneous sensing and effects platforms to cover large ocean areas.  These platforms will leverage satellite communications to populate a large data repository with sensor outputs for shared processing.  Ocean of Things will apply advanced analysis techniques to the stored data to synthesize and discover new signals and behaviors in the ocean environment.  The program will research the spatio-temporal composability of sensors and develop applications for distributed platform behavior using an internet of things architecture deployed across the world's oceans.  Further research will examine additional platform capabilities and system impacts of various communication rates and platform behaviors.  The Ocean of Things program will improve ocean awareness and provide access to areas not covered by existing platforms.

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full Scale Demonstration (HyDem) program is to dramatically improve U.S. Navy submarine superiority.  HyDem will apply breakthroughs in materials and material system technologies, and multi-disciplinary design methods to a Virginia Class submarine propulsor, a critical component in submarine performance.  The U.S. Navy's ability to operate their submarine fleet with improved capability allows for the creation of strategic surprise.  Submarines could exploit expanded areas that were previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions.  The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class submarine.  The Navy will evaluate this component in sea trials.  It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement submarines, and back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class submarines.  Technology developed under this program is transitioning to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Undersea platforms have inherent operational and tactical advantages such as stealth and surprise.  Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.  The Blue Wolf program seeks to provide a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges to be addressed include: dynamic lift and drag reduction, hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification, and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment.  The program will leverage Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies. Under an existing Memorandum of Agreement, following vehicle integration and initial testing, the program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  

The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.

The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of friendly assets.  Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other movers.  Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use.  Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms.  The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows an Aerial Dragnet to rapidly detect, track, and classify UAS incursions, thus enabling multiple defeat options.  This program focuses on the development of payloads, to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation.  The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-sized areas.  Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army and Marines with particular relevance to missions in the EUCOM and CENTCOM Area of Responsibilities (AORs).</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The proliferation of Radio Frequency (RF)-based countermeasures, such as Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM), has presented challenges to the effectiveness of data sensors.  The Multi-Optical Sensing (MOS) program will enable an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter class and long-range strike aircraft.  This program leverages emerging high-sensitivity Focal Plane Array (FPA) and compact, multi-band laser systems technology in the near/mid/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-optical sensing system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multi-band, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The MOS program seeks to advance the state of the art of components and technology to support an all-optical airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As a corollary to time synchronization, this program will also enable GPS-independent positioning to maintain precise time synchronization between collaborating mobile users.  Key attributes of this program are global availability, minimal and low cost infrastructure, anti-jamming capability, and performance equal to or better than GPS through recent advances in optical clocks and time transfer.  Demonstrations on relevant platforms in relevant environments will be used to validate the technology.  This program will transition to the Services, emphasizing platforms that operate in GPS-denied environments.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data.  Current ATRs are typically designed for specific sensors and static due to pre-programmed target lists and operating mode, limiting mission execution capabilities.  Extending ATR Technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets can be costly and time consuming.  The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operation limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life cycle maintenance costs.  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, sparse representations, manifold learning, and embedded systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR Technology.  The program will focus on three core areas: (1) development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR technology; (2) recognition technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and (3) technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software footprint of ATR systems.  ATR technology developed under the program is planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

The development objectives are technologies and systems with small Size, Weight and Power (SWaP), low recurring cost, applicability to a wide range of weapons and missions such as small unit operations, suppression of enemy air defenses, precision strike, and time-sensitive targets.  The technical approach for the sensing/processing hardware is to use both passive electro-optical infrared (EO/IR) sensors, which have evolved into very small and inexpensive devices in the commercial market, and a reconfigurable processing architecture, such as the architecture developed in DARPA's Adaptable, Low Cost Sensors (ADAPT) program.  The program will also develop a Government-owned open architecture for the seeker with standardized interfaces between components (both hardware and software).  The technical approach to target recognition will start from "deep learning" and 2D/3D machine vision algorithms pioneered for facial recognition and the identification of critical image features.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

Experimental payloads will be flown on small satellites, and data will be collected to validate new operational concepts.  Small satellites provide a low-cost and quick-turnaround capability for testing new technologies and experimental payloads.  Operationally, small and low-cost satellites enable the deployment of larger constellations which can provide greater coverage, persistence, and survivability compared to a small number of more expensive satellites, as well as the possibility for launch-on-demand.  This program seeks to leverage rapid progress being made by the commercial sector on small satellite bus technology, as well as investments being made by DoD and industry on low-cost launch and launch-on-demand capabilities for small satellites.  The program will focus on developing, demonstrating, and validating key payload technologies needed by DoD that are not currently being developed for commercial space applications.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Dominance of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum is critical to successful U.S. military operations.  Radar systems, Electronic Warfare (EW) systems, and communication systems require custom software and hardware that is costly and time consuming to build and integrate onto platforms.  The Dynamically Composed RF Systems program addresses these challenges by developing adaptive, converged RF array systems.  This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner.  This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and airframe integration and the associated wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; (3) a heterogeneous signal processing complex implementing hardware-agnostic RF operating modes (the RF Virtual Machine); (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance (a system and sensor resource manager (SSRM)).  This capability can be adapted to address diverse missions.  Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms such as the AC-130J aircraft in support of ground forces.  Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments, the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program will develop a real-time spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging sensor that provides imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program is anticipated to transition to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).</r2:Description>

Building on technologies explored under the Dynamically Composed RF Systems program, also in this Program Element/Project, the objective of ASTRAL is to provide a factor of at least 1000 times improvement over current signal awareness processing speed over broad spectral coverage.  The program will use technology that supports a development path leading to a mobile, tactical capability.  The development objectives of the ASTRAL program are to (1) develop a hybrid processor that provides real-time processing of the most challenging Low-Probability-of-Intercept (LPI) threat signals across a wide bandwidth, and (2) identify exploitation algorithms for military applications that are well-suited to this type of hybrid processor.  Several strategic and tactical spectrum awareness applications addressed include (a) real-time exploitation of optical communications, (b) city-wide wireless device geo-location, (c) broadband LPI radar warning, and (d) theater-wide spread-spectrum LPI radio geo-location.  ASTRAL will transition to the Services and Intelligence Community.</r2:Description>

Building on ideas explored in the System of Systems Enhanced Small Units (SESU) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), 3DNow will leverage the latest trends in image processing algorithms, embedded systems, portable devices, and assured separation kernel software to build an interface layer that securely connects the latest commercial hardware to the rest of the military infrastructure.  In order to mature and demonstrate the concept, 3DNow will conduct several development cycles focused on supporting tactical level urban warfare.  New technologies to be developed include mapping algorithms, image processing algorithms, and interoperability software and hardware.  This new technology will interface with commercial drones, Software Defined Radios (SDR), advanced sensors such as those found in self-driven cars (miniature radars and lidars), high-resolution imagers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  3DNow will transition the framework and sample systems to the Services.</r2:Description>

The tools produced by Cognitive Maneuver will automate gray zone information operations, and help U.S. Forces adapt to changing conditions and adversary responses. Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, Cognitive Maneuver will employ active sensing, and recommend actions U.S. forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and reveal any hostile strategies. To achieve this goal, Cognitive Maneuver will build and demonstrate tools to 1) develop a dynamic model of hostile activities in a gray zone environment, 2) assess the decision space to recommend which actions may provide the highest value information, and 3) monitor execution of these actions to assess incremental progress toward reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments.  Cognitive Maneuver will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program will pursue new algorithms for rapidly protecting DoD systems against new or unknown radar-based threats.  Protecting these systems currently relies on uniquely identifying an enemy radar and applying an appropriate, pre-programmed Electronic Countermeasure (ECM), which can take years to develop.  The emergence of digitally-programmed radars that exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics, however, has made this approach to countering radar-based threats increasingly challenging.  Developing new ECM over several years is no longer sufficient.  ARC will therefore pursue new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  Using techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, ARC will learn the behavior of the threat system and then choose and implement an appropriate countermeasure strategy.  The program is planned for transition to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps airborne electronic warfare systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Scanning Technology for Imaging Radars (ASTIR) program provided immediate benefit to applications that are constrained by power, weight, and the complexity limits of production.  The goal of this program was to demonstrate a new imaging radar architecture using an electronically scanned sub-reflector to produce a more readily available, cost-effective sensor solution that does not require platform or target motion.  Key system attributes included: (1) high-resolution 3D imaging for enhanced identification and targeting, independent of platform or target motion; (2) video frame rates to provide well-focused images even when there is platform or target motion; (3) beam steer with a single transmit/receive chain to reduce system complexity resulting in lower cost, power, and weight; and (4) millimeter-wave (mmW)/terahertz (THz) electronic component advancements from other DARPA programs for transmit and receive functions.  This program resulted in a more readily available, cost-effective imaging radar technology that works in concert with a wide area surveillance system to provide target identification at video frame rates in all conditions where existing sensors do not work.  Candidate military applications include efficient terminal seekers, imaging systems for defense of shipping in ports and littoral environments, base perimeter monitoring, and screening of personnel passing through access control points.  Technology developed under this program transitioned to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Multifunction RF (MFRF) program enabled U.S. rotary wing aircraft forces to fight effectively in all forms of severely Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) when our adversaries cannot.  The program went beyond landing aids in DVE to address all elements of combat to include landing, takeoff, hover/taxi, in route navigation, lethality, and survivability.  Building on previous RF sensors advancements, the program sought to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently developed situational and combat support systems to provide multifunction capability with flexibility of adding new mission functions.  This reduced the overall Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) of subsystems and protrusive exterior antennas on military aircraft, enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.  The program approach included: (1) development of synthetic vision for pilots that fuses sensor data with high-resolution terrain databases; (2) development of Advanced Rotary Multifunction Sensor (ARMS), utilizing silicon-based tile arrays, for agile electronically scanning technology at low SWaP-C; and (3) implementation of software development kit to re-define modes as required by mission or platform needs, and ease of adding new modes via software without hardware modifications.  Technology developed under this program transitioned to the Army.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>- Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate, formally Capability Package Directorate, underwent a name change to better reflect its mission to not only deliver systems and capabilities but also assist in the analysis of future system of systems architecture.  Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate remains the Army?s System of Systems Integration Team responsible for planning, managing, executing, and supporting the design, integration, interoperability, issuing, and technical assessment of the diverse systems and capabilities that are part of the Army?s modernized network. Over the past fiscal year Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate has collaborated with several Program Executive Offices and 14 Program Managers. Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate takes their systems, aligns and validates them based on the Army?s priority of standing up a communication network that is robust and resistant to vulnerabilities. This was accomplished through modernization efforts during Joint Warfighter Assessment 18.1 (JWA 18.1).  JWA 18.1 utilized new and recurring exercises in Germany to provide the required assessment environments.  European Command?s Blue Flag 18 was combined with Joint Modernization Command?s multi-national command post exercise at Grafenwoehr, Germany to provide a venue for joint and multi-national system of systems assessment.  Modernization efforts for United States Army Brigades were conducted at the Combined Arms Training Center, Hornfels, Germany, in conjunction with 2/1 ID?s Combined Resolve X.  The year-long planning and preparation for JWA 18.1 culminated with field operations in May 18.  Although field operations for Network Integration Evaluation 18.2 were conducted by 3/82 ABN at Fort Bliss in October 18, Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate executed numerous events to facilitate network planning and design, execute platform design and physically integration, ensure system integration and interoperability, and issue required equipment at Fort Bragg, North Carolina during Fiscal Year 18.  

- Moving modernization forward depends on a holistic approach to the interoperability of necessary systems and equipment. Over the year, Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate?s platform integration of fleets added up to approximately 1,200 hours of work to design and integrate 27 vehicles derived from 10 unique golden vehicles and prototypes, equipped with some of the most advanced technology, integrated alongside current force equipment, and instrumented to support objective test results.  During each event, on a daily basis Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate must manage approximately 150 Field Service Representatives, Field Service Engineers, Logistic Assistant Representatives, and Direct Support Engineers on servicing approximately 25 trouble tickets a day. The team assisted with the training of more than 1,212 Soldiers. 

- The Army Warfighting Assessment 18.1 was the first of its kind, conducted OCONUS and continued to develop, without formal testing constraints, advance solutions to the Army Warfighting Challenges in a Multi-Domain Operation (MDO).  Assessed were 18 concepts and capabilities that included robotics, expeditionary mission command, counter-unmanned aerial systems, Command Post Computing Environment, and autonomous vehicle operations.  Future force development priorities included Joint and Multinational interoperability and integration. For Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate, this meant hundreds of systems were loaded, established and validated. Multinational partners came together from Austria, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, France and Germany. 

- Network Integration Evaluation 18.2 was assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82st Airborne Division.   As the NIE mission was new to 82 ABN, soldiers and unit leadership once again faced a steep learning curve.  This was the second time the Fort Bliss team took the, ?show on the road? traveling to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to work offsite and complete the various phases vital to the execution of events at Fort Bliss.  In addition to the offsite work challenges, work was also complicated by the arrival of Hurricane Florence during the NIE validation exercise. MEAD conducted Platform Integration, where engineers configure the vehicles with radio and test equipment, the Golden Vehicle Build, where prototype vehicles are built and used to replicate the fleet of vehicles for the exercise, and the Validation Exercises that ensure the equipment is integrated and working properly offsite. For Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate, this meant 380 systems were loaded, 18 threads were validated, and 217 trouble tickets were resolved.</r2:Text>

These funds provide for Close out of NIE 18.2; Planning, Preparation, Execution, and Close-out for JWA 19; and initial planning for JWA 20. Planning and Preparation are expected to occur at Ft Bliss, TX, while, Execution and Close-out are expected to occur at various locations such as the unit?s home station or a Combined Arms Training Center. 

Planning:
These funds support the development and implementation of horse blanket architecture, conducting design activities for integration of capability onto unit vehicles, exercise planning and coordination, to include:
Developing a Validation Exercise (VALEX) plan that configures and checks out the system of systems prior to the exercise; assigning unit locations within the VALEX location; identifying and resolving security issues associated with running classified and/or coalition network operations; validating all Information Assurance Accreditations for networked C4ISR systems, and developing of technical mission threads used to validate the capabilities.
These funds also support defining the network system configurations and routing schemes for each event. 

Preparation: 
These funds support efforts leading up to the execution of the assessment exercise, to include LBRR, vehicle integration design and build, safety release, and conducting of VALEX. 
The LBRR risk reduction efforts are conducted in controlled laboratory environments to identify and resolve integration, configuration and interoperability issues prior to assessments. Reports delivered by the LBRR document the results of network functional testing, routing, and thread testing.
These funds provide for integration efforts such as design of installation kits on tactical platforms; fabrication of specialized cables, metal plates, racks, and brackets to enable platform installation/integration; and safety release testing.  The scope of the integration effort also includes planning for Field Service Representatives (FSRs) and other technical support personnel, coordination and movement of the Fleet vehicles, and inventory management of systems.
Following completion of platform integration efforts, these funds support a structured network VALEX consisting of four subordinate efforts: Load Exercise (LOADEX), ESTABLISH, INTEGRATE, and VALIDATE. 
-LOADEX; Support unit installation of new network capabilities into existing network, to include setting Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and configure network systems changes; modify radio mission plans, system configuration files and system parameters; and perform test/fix/test processes at the system and component levels.
-ESTABLISH; Verification of new hardware and software performance at the platform level. Troubleshoot issues associated with network system configurations and verify that each integrated platform can perform its mission while operating on the network.
-INTEGRATE; Verification of networked related hardware/software performance and networked communications at each echelon. Troubleshoot issues found with new capabilities and ensure tactical unit information exchange will enable units to support their intended missions. 
-VALIDATE; Support unit conduct of mission threads to verify the correct routing of messages and information transfer among critical nodes in the network. 

Execution:
Funding supports all management and synchronization of field operations and support personnel during the events, and coordination with the supported command. It also includes monitoring of network operations in the field, trouble ticket management, continued LBRR support to troubleshoot technical issues, deployment of mobile facilities, and replacement parts/components required to effectively support concepts and capabilities under assessment.

Closeout:
These funds support all activities associated with the de-installation and recovery of systems, components, A-kits, cabling installed on platforms, and restoration of platforms to baseline configurations.  Removal, inspection, repair/replacement, shipping, and storing of all materiel and infrastructure used to enable the unit to execute the event.  Conduct AARs for process improvements.

                                        <r2:Text>JWA 20; and initial planning for JWA 21:
These funds provide for execution, close-out and assessment for JWA 20; and initial planning for JWA 21.  Execution of JWA 20 is expected at Grafenwoehr, Germany with JWA 21 planning expected to occur at Ft Bliss, TX and to be determined location supporting Pacific area.  As the Army Future Command matures, Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate also expects to support planning, preparation, execution, close-out, and assessment of other exercises within the JMC portfolio. 

Planning: These funds support the development and implementation of horse blanket architecture; conducting design activities for integration of capability onto unit platforms; development, engineering, and documentation of network; and exercise planning and coordination, to include: developing a Validation Exercise (VALEX) plan that configures and checks out the system of systems prior to the exercise; assigning unit locations within the VALEX location; identifying and resolving security issues associated with running classified and/ or coalition network operations; validating all Information Assurance Accreditations for networked C4ISR systems and developing of technical mission threads used to validate the capabilities. 

These funds also support defining the network system configurations and routing schemes for each event.

These funds support efforts to provide technical input on candidate systems at the Concepts and Capabilities Review Board and Strategic Planning Reviews for future events.

Preparation: 
These funds support efforts leading up to the execution of the assessment exercise, to include lab based risk reduction (LBRR), platform integration design and build, safety release, and conducting of VALEX.  The LBRR risk reduction efforts are conducted in controlled laboratory environments to identify and resolve integration, configuration and interoperability issues prior to assessments. Reports delivered by the LBRR document the results of network functional testing, routing, and thread testing.

These funds provide for integration efforts such as design of installation kits on tactical platforms; fabrication of specialized cables, metal plates, racks, and brackets to enable platform installation/integration; and safety release testing. The scope of the integration effort also includes planning for Field Service Representatives (FSRs) and other technical support personnel, coordination and movement of the Fleet vehicles, and inventory management of systems.

Following completion of platform integration efforts, these funds support a structured network VALEX consisting of four subordinate efforts; Load Exercise (LOADEX), ESTABLISH, INTEGRATE, and VALIDATE:
- LOADEX; Support unit installation of new network capabilities into existing network, to include setting Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and configure network systems changes; modify radio mission plans, system configuration files and system parameters; and perform test/fix/test processes at the system and component levels.
- ESTABLISH; Verification of new hardware and software performance at the platform level. Troubleshoot issues associated with network system configurations and verify that each integrated platform can perform its mission while operating on the network.
- INTEGRATE; Verification of networked related hardware/software performance and networked communications at each echelon. Troubleshoot issues found with new capabilities and ensure tactical unit information exchange will enable units to support their intended missions.
- VALIDATE; Support unit conduct of mission threads to verify the correct routing of messages and information transfer among critical nodes in the network.

Execution: 
Funding supports all management and synchronization of field operations and support personnel during the events and coordination with the supported command. It also includes monitoring of network operations in the field, trouble ticket management, continued LBRR support to troubleshoot technical issues, deployment of mobile facilities, and replacement parts/ components required to effectively support concepts and capabilities under assessment.

Closeout: 
These funds support all activities associated with the de-installation and recovery of systems, components, A-kits, cabling installed on platforms, and restoration of platforms to baseline configurations. Removal, inspection, repair/replacement, shipping, and storing of all materiel and infrastructure used to enable the unit to execute the event. Conduct AARs for process improvements.
Assessment:  These funds support activities associated with providing documentation and technical assessment of the system of systems architecture to include interfaces between systems, compare and contrast between architecture characteristics, and compliance with published network standards.

In FY2020 the Joint Warfighter Assessment (JWA), a key component of the Army's Force 2025 Maneuvers, will occur in Europe in support of US Army Europe and US European Command. The JWA is used to assess interim solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges. The JWA concept maximizes collective resources to advance joint and multinational interoperability, future force development, and unit training readiness priorities. Concepts and capabilities are embedded in a live, virtual, and constructive Multinational Division (MND) exercise that is representative of current and future operational environments. The JWA provides a unique opportunity to increase innovation, improve interoperability, and enhance unit readiness. JWA offers the triple pay-off with future force development, training readiness, and Joint / Multinational interoperability assessment opportunities. These funds support the following major efforts associated with an assessment:

- Planning: Coordination with multiple stakeholders on the participation and resourcing of personnel, services, equipment and prototypes, and other deliverables needed for risk reduction events, capability and platform integration, training, field support and logistics, event battle rhythm/schedule, and developing network data products.
- Preparation: Conduct risk reduction, complete system integrated designs and builds, build prototype vehicles for safety release, conduct system installation and checkout, validate the network, and obtain Information Assurance certifications. A key preparation task is the full scale live network validation event, which includes Cyber Vulnerability and Penetration Assessment of the network. This ensures the technical architecture and security procedures are place to support an exercise of this scale and complexity. Additionally, preparation efforts will supports new system user training.
- Execution: Technical and logistics support during soldier-led assessments, trouble ticket management and closeout, and field support management.
- Close-out: Inventorying platforms/systems, de-installing equipment, returning platforms to their original configurations. All unit equipment will be returned to original configuration following the exercise to ensure unit is fully prepared to execute wartime mission. The final close out task is conduct of After Action Review (AAR) and capture of lessons learned both for systems and architecture, as well as process and procedures for support exercises. 

These funds may also be used for procuring limited equipment and materials (to include prototypes, when required), event infrastructure, field services, personnel support (government and contractor), and travel. These funds may also support similar activities for smaller assessment events leading up to the Joint Warfighter Assessment. Additionally, these funds will support initial planning for the Joint Warfighter 21, scheduled to support US Pacific Command and US Army Pacific. Planning events may occur at home station or require travel to support unit locations. Planning activities will include things such as concept and capability solicitation, initial architecture considerations, and logistics planning.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>- Developed project schedules and developed integrated assessment architecture for Electronic Warfare capabilities for Phases I and II supporting the USAREUR (United States Army Europe) ONS (Operational Needs Statement).  Conducted performance analysis and documented critical capability deliveries, integration timelines, operational assessments, and fielding plans enabling a rapid fielding of Phase I capabilities in Europe in January 2019.

- Creatively developed a new approach from the ground-up to document a new series of Army End-to-End (E2E) Architecture products.  Approach took on issues in research, data gathering, information consolidation, and standardized simple-but-effective diagramming techniques. A series of architecture products documented the logical network structure, down to the individual router / switch / firewall / network device, of the entire Army network.  Networks include individual soldiers at the tactical level up to the enterprise network edges owned by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and the many Army-specific Multi-protocol Label Switching networks.  Completed products included an E2E Baseline Architecture, E2E PACOM (Pacific Command) Architecture, and E2E EUCOM (European Command) Architecture delivered to Army community to support and inform on various Army decisions and acquisitions efforts.

- Executed an analysis that took the holistic Army and DISA networks and identified gaps in security coverage that required an increased Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) presence in for Garrison DCO Platform (GDP) placement.  Analysis required research on cyber operations from both the Cyber Center of Excellence and the Cyber Protection Brigade to understand stakeholder concepts of employment in cyberspace.  Results informed on the quantity of GDP acquisitions, potentially saving the Army millions of dollars.  Additionally, the outcome provided the DCO community at the O6 and GO (General Officer) level with a new and unique perspective with the OCSE subject matter expertise to make better informed decisions.

- Conducted a series of quick turn-around analysis that informed ASA(ALT) on the feasibility of new systems (Move-Out Jump Off (MOJO), Architecture, Integration, Design and Engineering (AIDE), Windows Tactical Assault Kit (WINTAK)/Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK), Threat System Management (TSM), Handheld Link 16 (HHL16)) to meet existing Army capability gaps.  Analysis included independent research on each system and their subject matter experts, requirements breakdown within the gaps being addressed, integration, and finally potential overlap with existing and future Program of Record systems.  Results identified key pros and cons with each technology and informed up to the GO level. 

- Conducted an analysis exploring employment of Model Based System Engineering into RCO/OCSE processes to aid in developing new systems.  Completed a model that lays the foundation for application of future RCO and OCSE work, specifically in the areas of electronic warfare and precision fires, providing a more thorough, disciplined, and engineering process-oriented approach for RCO/OCSE.   Completed its pilot developing a plugin used to analyze potential single modes of failure in system of system data flows.  This Electronic Warfare (EW) plugin correlates threads against configurable unavailable spectrum ranges (possibly blocked due to EW) and identifies nodes that don?t have alternative means of communications in such conditions.  This pilot work can be preconfigured for specific enemy jammer threats in a classified environment to provide first-order analysis during architecture development.

- Framed and developed the approach for identifying the Army's Blue Force (BLUFOR) electronic signature for quick turnaround analysis.  Due to the project timeline limits, identified tradeoffs in BLUFOR signature focuses and scoped the analysis execution within the Army's Coalition Joint Spectrum Management Planning Tool (CJSMPT).  Results informed the RCO/OCSE leadership on the vulnerability of the Army's brigade combat team to enemy signal detection.

- Established the integrated architecture team between OCSE, TRADOC, and G-6 to lead in the Network Cross Functional Team's (N-CFT) development of a disciplined system of systems engineering process to develop and document the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN). Synchronized requirements across PEOs, G-6, and TRADOC on architecture efforts of Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) necessary to achieve Mission Command Network Modernization (MCNM) during FY18 and FY19. These products were delivered to the N-CFT Director (2-star GO) and are currently being used to engage continued ITN development to fulfill specific communities of interest (e.g. fires, aviation, etc.) and also being served as an ongoing documentation of the evolving ITN as new solutions are made available for the network. 

- Developed Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) roadmaps by leveraging the ASA(ALT) IMS data to support decisions on Program of Record (PoR) fielding and risk reduction efforts by capturing critical path analysis to identify analysis/design, decision and PoR delivery and fielding requirements for risk reduction, evaluation and fielding.  Completed initial recommendations for white paper and modeling &amp; simulation (M&amp;S) analysis to inform on the ITN. These recommendations identified the need for an ITN Design Book with parallel white paper development efforts to inform on topics such as regions a Secure but Unclassified (SBU) network would be unusable.  The analysis was presented at the Network Synchronization Working Group.

- Spearheaded an effort across PEO/PM and Cross Functional Team (CFT) Network to support the development of the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) Design Book identifying the design of the ITN, with emphasis on the new systems, their implications, and challenges to be addressed.  It is collaboration between members of ASA(ALT) to capture many of the design considerations, risks, and future analysis opportunities in the current iteration of the ITN as a technical snapshot in time.  It is a living document and will continue to evolve as analyses and data-informed decisions occur. 

- Led the SoS engineering and Integration for LTG Richardson, AFC/Office of Program Innovation &amp; Integration (OPII), with an integrated architecture team of AIMD (ARCIC), Officer of the Chief System Engineer (ASA ALT), and Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G6 to establish architecture as a mechanism to integrate capabilities across CFTs enabling senior leader decision making, analysis, and trades.  The team will deploy to all CFTs within 90 days to gather architecture data for integrated mission threads across the CFTs and provide a prototype for the use of architecture as an integrating tool.  Successfully developed integrated architecture from CFT STE and CFT SL for IVAS and provided a set of emerging SoS dependencies between the two CFTs.  The briefing was well received by CFT General Officers / Directors.

*Project FG7 Emerging Technology Initiatives was created in support of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO). This project was realigned to PE 0605054A Emerging Technologies Initiatives in FY 2019 for greater transparency of the Army RCO efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced Soldier, ground, aviation, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence &amp; Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems and equipment.

The Primary goal is to take technologies to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 and 8 through a collaborative and accelerated acquisition process. Technologies will be demonstrated in relevant environments, performing tactical/operational scenarios. Efforts will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability within one to five years. Efforts will include accelerated material development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs in Cyber; Electronic Warfare (EW); Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Survivability and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical Program of Record capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements, and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.

The Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders' needs. The Army RCO was established per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT: Establishment of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, signed by the Secretary of the Army: Eric K. Fanning, dated 11 August 2016.

The RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally. Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.   

The RCO capabilities focus areas are:
Cyber
Electronic Warfare (EW)
Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT)
Survivability
Operational Needs Statements (ONS)
Any other operational needs that become a priority as designated by the Army Board of Directors (BOD)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>These funds were used to identify, develop, procure, modify, and evaluate prototypes providing capability prioritized by the Board of Directors (BOD) in the areas of Cyber, EW, PNT, Survivability, and Other critical capability gaps. Funding supported infrastructure, procurement of prototypes, engineering and material for integration, field support representation, early acquisition documentation, system modification, and development and operational testing needed to transition a procurement ready solution to an acquisition program for execution. 

Electronic Warfare Phase 1 Requirements (In support of USAREUR ONS ? 16-21509) -  continued integration and assessment that began in FY 2017 for Ground EW capability with enhanced and networked capability for Prophet, Versatile Radio Observation &amp; Direction Finding (VROD) / Modular Adaptive Transmitter (VMAX) and Sabre Junction. 

Electronic Warfare Phase 2 Requirements (In support of USAREUR ONS ? 16-21509) - continued integration and assessment that began in FY 2017 of air EW capability. Funding acquired long lead prototypes, conducted non-recurring integration engineering and risk reduction exercises, and enabled further development of ground EW prototype capabilities.

Positioning, Navigation and Timing Phase 1 Requirements (In support of USAREUR ONS ? 16-21509) - continued integration and assessment of the DAGR Distributed Device Enhancement (D3E) w/Anti-Jam (AJ) Antenna and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Sensors. Non-recurring engineering and integration of the D3E/AJ onto the Bradley, Abrams, Stryker and Paladin platforms was conducted in FY 2018 to obtain a Capabilities and Limitations (C&amp;L) report to enable Urgent Materiel Release (UMR).

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army RCO capitalizes on current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to address emerging threats and high impact capability opportunities of U.S. Army Forces deployed globally. This is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and 2) developing emerging deployable capability through research and development organizations, academia, and industry. The RCO uses streamlined acquisition methods, processes and techniques to rapidly acquire capability; these methods vary by project. The Rapid Capabilities Office will have a dedicated contracting staff, with the flexibility to use both traditional and non-traditional contracting approaches. To reach non-traditional vendors, RCO will use non-standard contracting methods, such as Other Transaction Authority instruments. Where practicable, prototypes will be acquired using competitive procedures. Projects will be transitioned to an approved acquisition program for production and sustainment. Operational assessments will be conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation, prototype maturation, and future capability development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds multiple efforts for engineering development of weapons and munitions systems.

Project 613, Mortar Systems: This Project supports Fire Control Modernization (FCM) and High Explosive Guided Mortar (HEGM).

The Fire Control Modernization (FCM) Project funds engineering development of Common / Universal Fire Control Systems applicable to Indirect Fire mortar weapon systems.  This includes a modernized digital pointing system that will be integrated with the M120A1 120mm mortar weapon systems, M121 120mm mortar weapon systems, and potentially digitize the M252 81mm mortar weapon systems.  Fire Control Modernization will replace the current M67 sight unit and upgrade the M95 and M150 fire control systems with modernized pointing device and mount.  The modernized pointing device will enhance responsiveness, survivability, mobility, maintainability, and minimize mortar crew exposure to enemy fire. Fire Control Modernization intends to include the addition of round counting capabilities, muzzle velocity sensing, reduced power draw, streamlined communication, and employ a common fire control software solution across mortar systems.  FY 2020 funds will support engineering initiatives and prototyping of fire control line replaceable units (LRU) and software.  

The High Explosive Guided Mortar (HEGM) Project funded engineering development of precision guidance systems applicable to Indirect Fire mortar weapon systems.  HEGM provides a precision capability to support the close fight in urban and complex terrain, while at the same time, reducing collateral damage.  HEGM provides precision accuracy and effectiveness for 120mm mortar systems using precision guidance systems that will effectively reduce target delivery error.  The HEGM capability will be developed through the use of improved guidance and control components and advanced airframe design that allow sufficient maneuver of the cartridge in flight to correct for induced error providing the ability to engage targets without the need to adjust fire.  The HEGM Project was terminated in FY 2018 with close-out completion in FY 2019.

Project EC4,  Non-Standard Simulator Munitions: The Non-Standard Simulator Munitions Project will standardize various pyrotechnics that simulate battlefield effects. The Army's Combat Training Centers (CTCs) are currently using non-standard munitions to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield effects. These modified commercial-off-the-shelf products have not been type classified, material released, and are not safe or sustainable for use by Soldiers. This effort will develop and demonstrate various pyrotechnics/simulators to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield affects such as: Black smoke signature (burning vehicles, buildings, and equipment); Yellow smoke signature (chemical, biological or nuclear effects); Macro pyrotechnics to simulate hostile fire and small Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during mounted operations in urban terrain; Micro pyrotechnics to simulate indoor hostile fire and IED effects that are capable of being integrated into existing facilities; Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) on a wire to replicate the flight of a Rocket Propelled Grenade; High Order Blast Effect (HiOBE) used to replicate a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED), building explosions, and other significant explosive events; Artillery airburst (LA45) simulator to replicate indirect fire; simulator to replicate a STINGER (LA47) firing; Tracer Fire-back simulator to replicate enemy small arms fire and anti-aircraft fire. Standardization will reduce training costs, eliminate redundancies between systems, mitigate environmental concerns and safety risks associated with realistic scenario based training.

Project ED7, Advanced Multipurpose (AMP) Cartridge: The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) Project is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  AMP has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay, and airburst.  AMP is the materiel solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m threshold and 50m to 4500m objective, a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battle carry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including Anti Tank Guided Missile teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015.  FY 2020 funds supports continuation of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts and testing in preparation for Milestone C and transition into Procurement.

Project EL9, Ammunition Logistics Prototyping: The Ammunition Logistics Prototyping Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. FY 2020 funding will be used to continue integrating the munitions health monitoring system with additional ammunition items and conduct qualification tests and continue to integrate passive time/temperature exposure sensors with additional ammunition items and conduct qualification testing.

Project EP2, Shoulder-Launched Munitions:  This project previously funded the one-time acceleration of the Tandem Warhead type classification and completion of development and testing for use in the Shoulder Launched AT-4 Single-use 84mm Anti-Tank Weapon.  The AT-4 Tandem Warhead provides a single shot solution with increased lethality for infantry crew formations against anti-armor and to defeat hardened structures.  The AT-4 effort was part of the Secretary of Defense's Close Combat Lethality task force.

The Individual Assault Munition (IAM) will be a lightweight Shoulder Launched Munition (SLM) capability for combat units at the individual Soldier level. As an improvement over existing Shoulder Launched Munitions, the solution will allow Soldiers to conduct Urban Operations with an ability to defeat the enemy protected by a variety of field expedient, structural and lightly armored vehicles. This solution will be effective day or night at close ranges with an ability to safely engage targets from within enclosures using single hearing protection. This solution will combine the capability of multiple existing shoulder-launched munitions which will allow for reduced Soldier load, training complexity and logistics burden for Light Infantry, Combat Engineers and Special Operations Forces. FY 2020 funding will provide the Army the opportunity to evaluate various prototype munitions to achieve emerging increased capability as an Individual Assault Munition. The Individual Assault Munition Capabilities Development Document (CDD) was approved on 11 March 2016. The Individual Assault Munition effort is a new start in FY 2020.  

Project EP3, Reduced Range Ammunition - Small Caliber: The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of Reduced Range Ammunition is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas.  Reduced Range Ammunition will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The  Reduced Range Ammunition cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. FY 2020 funding supports continuing Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts and performing design/verification testing on the 7.62mm variant. FY 2020 funds also support Milestone (MS) B activities to include Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Contract Award for the .50 caliber variant. FY 2020 funds also supports  Reduced Range Ammunition concept development/evaluation for the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) systems.

Project EP4, One-Way Luminescence for Small Caliber Ammo: The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 Caliber Munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL projects objective is to develop and field a full day/night tracer round, replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability. 7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm OWL cartridges and later followed by .50 Caliber cartridges and Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition. FY 2020 funding will support continuing Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts, conducting a Critical Design review (CDR), performing development tests, and a User Assessment (UA) for the 7.62mm variant. FY 2020 also supports concept development/evaluation of OWL tracer solutions for .50 Caliber weapons and NGSW.

Project EP5, Adv Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Caliber Ammo: This Project supports both the Advanced Armor-Piercing ammunition and the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) Family of Ammunition.

 - Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP): The ADVAP project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158. The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) both 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge for the M240 machine gun and ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm. The ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm for the Next Generation Squad Weapons is referred to as the Special Purpose ammunition. The objective is to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges. No funding has been requested for ADVAP in FY 2020.

 - Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) Family of Ammunition: The NGSW ammo is a new ammunition technology under development for use in the Next Generation Squad Weapon systems. The objective is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) the new ammunition. No funding requested in FY 2020.

Project EP7, Aviation Airborne Expandable Countermeasures: The Aviation Airborne Expandable Countermeasures Project will support Integrated System Design (ISD), System Capability (SC) and Manufacturing Process Demonstrations (MPD) on current pyrotechnic munitions and tunable pyrotechnic aircraft counter measures and decoys. The project will also support ISD, SC and MPD on new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided missile threats. Activities include modeling and simulation, flight testing, qualification testing, engineering to reduce size and weight, environmental considerations, safety enhancements, manufacturing enhancements, qualification of other service and foreign munitions that could meet current requirements, product improvements, insertion of new technologies to increase performance, and enhancement of current flare solutions for new and existing aircraft. Systems include impulse cartridges and aircraft expendables (to include Radio Frequency (RF) expendables).

Project EU4, 40mm HV Improved High Explosive Dual Purpose: 40mm High Velocity (HV) High Explosive Dual Purpose - Airburst (HEDP-AB) is a new capability identified in the 40mm High Velocity Improved High Explosive Dual Purpose Cartridge Capability Development Document (CDD) and will provide the Mk19 Mod 3 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG) an airburst capable cartridge with the ability of achieving required lethal effects against enemy targets in the open and in defilade while maintaining the capability to defeat unarmored and lightly armored vehicles.  FY 2020 funding supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities including Design Engineering Test (DET) 1, DET 2, Soldier Touch Point (Limited User Evaluation), Family of Weapon Sights - Crew Served (FWS-CS) Integration, and preparation for the contractor down-selection.

Project EU6: The XM1113 High Explosive Extended Range Artillery Projectile is a critical munition that supports the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.  The XM1113 is a government owned materiel solution for long-range cannon artillery projectiles that will attain ranges of 40km in 39 caliber weapon systems and 70km in future systems.  The XM1113 will provide 33% increased range over obsolete and aging M549A1 Rocket Assisted Projectile using a larger, modern rocket motor and optimized aerodynamic airframe.  The XM1113 will leverage enhanced lethality cannon munition technologies to compensate for increased rocket motor volume.  The projectile body is filled with an insensitive munition (IM) high explosive (HE) and a supplementary charge to aid in soldier survivability.  FY 2020 funds will support fuze performance evaluation and confirmation with XM1113 for Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) in FY 2021, as well as the continued engineering efforts of the XM1113 maturation in support of a Milestone C in FY 2022.

Project EU7: The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) Project will evaluate, develop, and qualify new lethality technologies for 155mm cannon artillery munitions and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to production. The ELCM Project supports testing and assessment of the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Systems M999 advanced anti-personnel munition and also accelerates the qualification of the 155mm XM1128 High Explosive Projectile including the evaluation of Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT); both of these initiatives support the Army Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the replacement of the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM). FY 2020 funds will support fuze performance evaluation and confirmation with XM1128, as well as continued Insensitive Munitions (IM) testing, Sequential Environmental Test - Safety (SET-S), and Military Standard Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests (MIL-STD-810). Engineering efforts will support the evaluation of the XM1128 test data to determine that the Program is safe, suitable and operationally effective, as well as the gathering of all statutory and regulatory requirements in support of a Milestone C in FY 2021.

Project EU8:  The Improved Multi-Option Fuze Project (MOFA II/iMOFM) is a technology refresh and modernization effort that provides an incremental capability with technology advancements and performance improvements on the current non-precision artillery and mortar ammunition proximity multi-option fuzes that will increase robustness to electronic countermeasures (ECM), eliminates the susceptibility of reverse engineering (RE), incorporates power source advancements, improves delay mode reliability, and integrates safe &amp; arm improvements. This will develop and qualify safe, affordable, reliable Proximity Height of Burst fuzing solutions with robust Defense Exportability Features (DEF) for non-precision conventional Cannon artillery and Mortar munitions that are resistant to adversary exploitation via ECM and RE threats. FY 2020 will support the preparation and incrementing of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts, the fabrication of MOFA II and iMOFM hardware to conduct developmental verification tests and Product Qualification Tests (PQT), the iMOFM Critical Design Review (CDR), and the preparations for transition into production.

Project EW1: The 40mm Low Velocity High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The 40mm Low Velocity HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to engage targets at increased effective ranges using the 40mm M320 Grenade Launcher. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge. The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability. FY 2020 will support Design Engineering Test (DET) 2 and DET 3 build, Soldier Touch Point (Limited User Evaluation), Test Readiness Reviews (TRRs) and DET 2 Testing. 

The 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Door Breach (DB), XM1167, cartridge allows the grenadier to conduct a ballistic breach of an existing door to create an entry point into a building or other structure. This capability is critical during Urban Operations, while having stand-off ability to conduct ballistic breach at ranges up to 50 meters away, with a single-shot, and without pause between actual breach and entry of initial force. The 40mm DB cartridge will provide the small unit with the capability to conduct efficient breaching operations; allowing the Warfighter to create an entry point into a structure for an assault element to enter and begin clearing operations, one of the most difficult types of operations that Soldiers may face in an urban environment. The 40mm DB cartridge will reduce collateral damage and friendly casualties associated with breaching operations.  The deployment of 40mm Door Breach cartridges will enable the small unit to gain and maintain a tactical advantage through efficiency of combat power and momentum. No funding requested in FY 2020.

Project FA6: The 30mm Lethality project funds the development of a suite of 30x173mm caliber cartridges, which includes anti-personnel tactical and training cartridges and anti-materiel tactical and training cartridges as well as Airburst Munition cartridges for Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) and Full Materiel Release (FMR). The objective is to enhance the operational effectiveness and lethality of the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV), Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV), and any Army Fighting Vehicles that are equipped with a 30x173mm weapon system. The tactical cartridges will provide an organic direct fire capability to support infantry at a greater range and will improve lethality when engaging dismounted infantry and light armored vehicles. The training cartridges will be ballistically matched to the tactical cartridges, allowing the Warfighter to train in a cost effective manner. The Airburst munitions will provide the Warfighter with increased lethality against troops in the open, counter defilade and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM). This project will leverage earlier efforts in support of the Stryker Operational Needs Statement (ONS) for Increased Lethality for the 2nd Calvary Regiment (2CR), United States Army Europe (USAREUR) (HQDA ONS 15-20590).  FY 2020 funding will support three Design Engineering Tests (DET) and a Design Verification Test (DVT) for the non-airburst 30x173mm suite of ammunition. FY 2020 will also support Milestone B and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award for the 30x173mm Airburst munition.

Project FL4: Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) Family of Ammunition: The Small Caliber Ammo for Next Gen Squad Weapons project is a critical technology development in response to the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) Initial Capability Document (ICD) for the ammunition required to support the rapid prototyping, development, and fielding of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) under Section 804 Authority. The objective is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) the new ammunition. The NGSW ammunition is split into two initial variants, the General Purpose (GP) and the Special Purpose (SP). FY 2020 funding supports continuing rapid prototyping/development of the GP projectile, building prototypes and maturing prototypes to provide to the weapon system contractors for performance evaluation, conducting a Critical Design Review (CDR), and conducting prototype testing. FY 2020 also supports continuing rapid prototyping for the SP projectile, conducting a Preliminary Design Review (PDR), conducting an Initial Product Review (IPR), and performing activities to increase prototype capacity to support planned weapon system testing. Follow-on NGSW ammunition types include: tracer ammunition, blank ammunition, reduced range ammunition, and Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK) ammunition. Development efforts on the follow-on NGSW ammunition variants are scheduled to begin in FY 2022. FY 2020 supports initial activities to evaluate potential solutions/prototypes and concepts to satisfy follow-on NGSW ammunition requirements.

Project S36: The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a course correcting fuze that provides precision accuracy and efficiency for current and future 155mm High Explosive (HE) projectiles by eliminating a portion of the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions which effectively reduces the number of projectiles required to execute fire missions. PGK utilizes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and internal Guidance and Navigation Computer to accomplish its mission with point detonating and height of burst fuzing functions. The PGK M1156E1 effort will incorporate and qualify state of the art technologies to increase the functionality of PGK in GPS degraded environments as well as compatibility with the Army's new long range cannon (Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA)) and projectiles which will be fielded during the PGK Life Cycle. PGK Anti-Jam (PGK-AJ) supports future 155mm projectiles and M777 Long Range Cannon (LRC) initiatives and Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.  FY 2020 funding supports the award of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract initiating system design and prototype development for PGK Anti-Jam.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Fire Control Modernization (FCM) Project funds engineering development of Common / Universal Fire Control Systems applicable to Indirect Fire mortar weapon systems.  This includes a modernized digital pointing system that will be integrated with the M120A1 120mm mortar weapon systems, M121 120mm mortar weapon systems, and potentially digitize the M252 81mm mortar weapon systems.  FCM will replace the current M67 sight unit and upgrade the M95 and M150 fire control systems with modernized pointing device and mount.  The modernized pointing device will enhance responsiveness, survivability, mobility, maintainability, and minimize mortar crew exposure to enemy fire.  FCM intends to include the addition of round counting capabilities, muzzle velocity sensing, reduced power draw, streamlined communication, and employ a common fire control software solution across mortar systems.  FY 2020 funds will support engineering initiatives and prototyping of fire control line replaceable units (LRU) and software.  

The High Explosive Guided Mortar (HEGM) Project funded engineering development of precision guidance systems applicable to Indirect Fire mortar weapon systems.  HEGM provides a precision capability to support the close fight in urban and complex terrain, while at the same time, reducing collateral damage.  HEGM provides precision accuracy and effectiveness for 120mm mortar systems using precision guidance systems that will effectively reduce target delivery error.  The HEGM capability will be developed through the use of improved guidance and control components and advanced airframe design that allow sufficient maneuver of the cartridge in flight to correct for induced error providing the ability to engage targets without the need to adjust fire.  The HEGM Project was terminated in FY 2018 with close-out completion in FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project will standardize various pyrotechnics that simulate battlefield effects.  The Army's Combat Training Centers (CTCs) are currently using non-standard munitions to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield effects.  These modified commercial-off-the-shelf products have not been type classified, material released, and are not safe or sustainable for use by Soldiers.  This effort will develop and demonstrate various pyrotechnics/simulators to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield affects such as:  Black smoke signature (burning vehicles, buildings, and equipment); Yellow smoke signature (chemical, biological or nuclear effects); Macro pyrotechnics to simulate hostile fire and small Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during mounted operations in urban terrain; Micro pyrotechnics to simulate indoor hostile fire and IED effects that are capable of being integrated into existing facilities; Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) on a wire to replicate the flight of a Rocket Propelled Grenade; High Order Blast Effect (HiOBE) used to replicate a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED), building explosions, and other significant explosive events; Artillery airburst (LA45) simulator to replicate indirect fire; simulator to replicate a STINGER (LA47) firing; Tracer Fire-back simulator to replicate enemy small arms fire and anti-aircraft fire.  Standardization will reduce training costs, eliminate redundancies between systems, mitigate environmental concerns and safety risks associated with realistic scenario based training.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  AMP has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay, and airburst.  AMP is the materiel solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m threshold and 50m to 4500m objective, a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015.  In FY 2020 the program will transition into Procurement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  FY 2020 funding will be used to continue integrating the munitions health monitoring system with additional ammunition items and conduct qualification tests and continue to integrate passive time/temperature exposure sensors with additional ammunition items and conduct qualification testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Individual Assault Munition effort is a new start in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EP2, Shoulder-Launched Munitions:  This project previously funded the one-time acceleration of the Tandem Warhead type classification and completion of development and testing for use in the Shoulder Launched AT-4 Single-use 84mm Anti-Tank Weapon.  The AT-4 Tandem Warhead provides a single shot solution with increased lethality for infantry crew formations against anti-armor and to defeat hardened structures.  The AT-4 effort was part of the Secretary of Defense's Close Combat Lethality task force.

The Individual Assault Munition (IAM) will be a lightweight Shoulder Launched Munition (SLM) capability for combat units at the individual Soldier level. As an improvement over existing Shoulder Launched Munitions, the solution will allow Soldiers to conduct Urban Operations with an ability to defeat the enemy protected by a variety of field expedient, structural and lightly armored vehicles. This solution will be effective day or night at close ranges with an ability to safely engage targets from within enclosures using single hearing protection. This solution will combine the capability of multiple existing shoulder-launched munitions which will allow for reduced Soldier load, training complexity and logistics burden for Light Infantry, Combat Engineers and Special Operations Forces. FY 2020 funding will provide the Army the opportunity to evaluate various prototype munitions to achieve emerging increased capability as an Individual Assault Munition. The Individual Assault Munition Capabilities Development Document (CDD) was approved on 11 March 2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber Reduced Range technology applies to multiple calibers.  The effort under Budget Activity 04, Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EL7, Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA), transitions in FY 2019 to Budget Activity 05, PE 0604802A, Project EP3, Reduced Range Ammunition - Small Caliber. PE 0604802A, Project EP3, RRA funding continues the development work of 7.62mm and supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2019 and the .50 Caliber EMD effort beginning in FY 2020.  RRA technologies will be assessed for adaptability to the new Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition; which will be further developed and fielded under a separate funding line in the future.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions.  The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas.  RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ.  This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges.  The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns.  FY 2020 funding supports continuing Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts and performing design/verification testing on the 7.62mm variant.  FY 2020 funds also support Milestone (MS) B activities to include Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Contract Award for the .50 caliber variant.  FY 2020 funds also supports RRA concept development/evaluation for the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber One Way Luminescence (OWL) technology applies to multiple calibers. In FY 2019, Budget Activity 4 Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EB8, 7.62mm OWL transitions to Budget Activity 5 (BA5) PE 0604802A, Project EP4, 7.62mm OWL.  OWL technologies will be assessed for adaptability to the new Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition; which will be further developed and fielded under a separate funding line in the future.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 Caliber Munitions CDD.  Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter.  The OWL projects objective is to develop and field a full day/night tracer round, replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm OWL cartridges and later followed by .50 Caliber cartridges and Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition.  FY 2020 funding will support continuing Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts, conducting a Critical Design review (CDR), performing development tests, and a User Assessment (UA) for the 7.62mm variant.  FY 2020 also supports concept development/evaluation of OWL tracer solutions for .50 Caliber weapons and NGSW.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>One Way Luminescence (OWL) is a new tracer technology that will be applied to multiple calibers.  The initial focus was on 7.62mm ammunition in FY 2015 followed by 5.56mm in FY 2018; and later followed by the .50 Caliber and NGSW ammunition.  As the technology matures the effort transitions from Budget Activity 4 (BA4) Program Element 0603639A, Project EB8 to Budget Activity 5 (BA5) Program Element 0604802A, Project EP4 in FY 2019 for 7.62mm, and FY 2021 for 5.56mm.  The OWL cartridge will be compatible with all Army Small Caliber weapon systems, but optimized for Machine Guns and will provide improved lethality/target effects over the current tracer munition.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The OWL concept will be developed through Government and Industry prototyping efforts. A Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) was conducted in FY 2015 and FY 2016 to measure the progress of the designs.  The FY 2017 and FY 2018 TRAs were conducted to evaluate the industry and Government concepts in order to proceed with the 7.62mm Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). The 5.56mm, NGSW, and .50 Caliber cartridges will follow the 7.62mm schedule with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) starting in FY 2021 for the 5.56mm variant. The new tracer cartridges will replace legacy tracers in each of the various small caliber configurations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) technology applies to multiple calibers. In FY 2017, Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EC2, Adv Armor- Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Cal Ammo transitioned to PE 0604802A, Project EP5, Adv Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Cal Ammo for development of the 7.62mm ammunition. The follow-on effort for ADVAP ammunition calibers below 7.62mm begins in FY 2019.  In FY 2020, PE 0604802A, Project EP5, Adv Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Cal Ammo transitions to PE 0604802A, Project FL4, Small Caliber Ammo for Next Gen Squad Weapons (NGSW) to continue development efforts on ADVAP ammunition for the NGSW.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP):  The ADVAP project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158. The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) both 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge for the M240 machine gun and ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm.  The ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm for the Next Generation Squad Weapons is referred to as the Special Purpose ammunition.  The objective is to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.  No funding requested in FY 2020.

Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) Family of Ammunition:  The NGSW ammo is a new ammunition technology under development for use in the Next Generation Squad Weapon systems.  The objective is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) the new ammunition.  No funding requested in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The project will also support ISD, SC and MPD on new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided missile threats. Activities include modeling and simulation, flight testing, qualification testing, engineering to reduce size and weight, environmental considerations, safety enhancements, manufacturing enhancements, qualification of other service and foreign munitions that could meet current requirements, product improvements, insertion of new technologies to increase performance, and enhancement of current flare solutions for new and existing aircraft.  Systems include impulse cartridges and aircraft expendables (to include Radio Frequency (RF) expendables).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 40mm High Velocity High Explosive Dual Purpose Airburst (HEDP-AB) cartridge will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. Milestone B approval will be followed by a competitive award for up to two EMD contractors for Design Engineering Test (DET) 1 and DET 2 to qualify the design to support requirements with sufficient confidence to enter into Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E). The contractors will develop an Airburst capable fuze to be retrofitted onto the currently fielded, High Explosive Point Detonating cartridges and develop a Programming Unit. Shortcomings and deficiencies will be corrected prior to subjecting the final design to DT&amp;E. Down-select to a single contractor will occur before DT&amp;E and production options. Test results will support the documentation for Milestone C and Type Classification-Limited Procurement (TC-LP). After Milestone C is achieved, a contract will be awarded for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and two production year options.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The XM1113 High Explosive Extended Range Artillery Projectile is a critical munition that supports the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.  The XM1113 is a government owned materiel solution for long-range cannon artillery projectiles that will attain ranges of 40km in 39 caliber weapon systems and 70km in future systems.  The XM1113 will provide 33% increased range over obsolete and aging M549A1 Rocket Assisted Projectile using a larger, modern rocket motor and optimized aerodynamic airframe.  The XM1113 will leverage enhanced lethality cannon munition technologies to compensate for increased rocket motor volume.  The projectile body is filled with an insensitive munition (IM) high explosive (HE) and a supplementary charge to aid in soldier survivability.  FY 2020 funds will support fuze performance evaluation and confirmation with XM1113 for Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) in FY 2021, as well as the continued engineering efforts of the XM1113 maturation in support of a Milestone C in FY 2022.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The XM1113 Project is utilizing four DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) initiatives for early development and prototyping:  One DOTC OTA will be with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) at Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Scranton, PA for the projectile body, the second with Savit Corporation in Rockaway, NJ to procure multiple small components and conduct the Load, Assemble, and Pack (LAP) with American Ordnance (AO) at Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAP), the third with Northrop Grumman in Plymouth, MN for fuze compatibility efforts, and the fourth with Nammo Talley in Mesa, AZ for the rocket grains.  The parts will support test activities in Yuma, Arizona.  In FY 2019, the U.S. Government is evaluating a single DOTC OTA to cover the XM1113 system to support the accelerated timeline and Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) of 2,000 projectiles in 3Q FY 2021, as well as the maturation XM1113 to meet Milestone C requirements in FY 2022.  The Program will transition to a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based production contract after Milestone C for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The ELCM Project supports testing and assessment of the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Systems M999 advanced anti-personnel munition and also accelerates the qualification of the 155mm XM1128 High Explosive Projectile including the evaluation of Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT); both of these initiatives support the Army Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the replacement of the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM).  FY 2020 funds will support fuze performance evaluation and confirmation with XM1128, as well as continued Insensitive Munitions (IM) testing, Sequential Environmental Test - Safety (SET-S), and Military Standard Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests (MIL-STD-810).  Engineering efforts will support the evaluation of the XM1128 test data to determine that the Program is safe, suitable and operationally effective, as well as the gathering of all statutory and regulatory requirements in support of a Milestone C in FY 2021.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 40mm Low Velocity High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The 40mm Low Velocity HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to engage targets at increased effective ranges using the 40mm M320 Grenade Launcher. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge. The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability. FY 2020 will support Design Engineering Test (DET) 2 and DET 3 build, Soldier Touch Point (Limited User Evaluation), Test Readiness Reviews (TRRs) and DET 2 Testing. 

The 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Door Breach (DB), XM1167, cartridge allows the grenadier to conduct a ballistic breach of an existing door to create an entry point into a building or other structure. This capability is critical during Urban Operations, while having stand-off ability to conduct ballistic breach at ranges up to 50 meters away, with a single-shot, and without pause between actual breach and entry of initial force. The 40mm Door Breach cartridge will provide the small unit with the capability to conduct efficient breaching operations; allowing the Warfighter to create an entry point into a structure for an assault element to enter and begin clearing operations, one of the most difficult types of operations that Soldiers may face in an urban environment. The 40mm Door Breach cartridge will reduce collateral damage and friendly casualties associated with breaching operations.  The deployment of 40mm Dor Breach cartridges will enable the small unit to gain and maintain a tactical advantage through efficiency of combat power and momentum. No funding requested in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The HEAB cartridge will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. Evaluate potential designs as part of the pre-EMD activities using a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with contractors to completed testing. For EMD, the Government anticipates awarding two contracts utilizing an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) through Department of Defense (DoD) Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC).  The EMD phase will consist of a series of Design Engineering Tests (DETs) to assess the Contractors' design progress and ability of achieving the program objectives.  Any shortcomings and deficiencies will be addressed prior to final Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E). After DT&amp;E and a successful Milestone C, the government will down-select to a single contractor for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and four production year options utilizing a follow-on Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contract.

The Door Breach cartridge development will consist of characterization testing of multiple designs provided by industry which will be used to further inform a potential future requirement.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 30mm Lethality project funds the development of a suite of 30x173mm caliber cartridges, which includes anti-personnel tactical and training cartridges and anti-materiel tactical and training cartridges, as well as Airburst Munition cartridges for Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) and Full Materiel Release (FMR). The objective is to enhance the operational effectiveness and lethality of the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV), Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV), and any Army Fighting Vehicles that are equipped with a 30x173mm weapon system. The tactical cartridges will provide an organic direct fire capability to support infantry at a greater range and will improve lethality when engaging dismounted infantry and light armored vehicles. The training cartridges will be ballistically matched to the tactical cartridges, allowing the Warfighter to train in a cost effective manner. The Airburst munitions will provide the Warfighter with increased lethality against troops in the open, counter defilade and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM). This project will leverage earlier efforts in support of the Stryker Operational Needs Statement (ONS) for Increased Lethality for the 2nd Calvary Regiment (2CR), United States Army Europe (USAREUR) (HQDA ONS 15-20590).  FY 2020 funding will support three Design Engineering Tests (DET) and a Design Verification Test (DVT) for the non-airburst 30x173mm suite of ammunition. FY 2020 will also support Milestone B and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award for the 30x173mm Airburst munition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be sent to industry soliciting responses to the requirements of Army Performance Specifications for the following items: 30x173mm anti-materiel tactical cartridge (XM1170), 30x173mm anti-materiel training cartridge (XM1172), 30x173mm anti-personnel tactical cartridge (XM1171), and 30x173mm anti-personnel training cartridge (XM1173). Contracts will be awarded to viable contractors for the development and qualification of each family of cartridges (anti-personnel family and anti-materiel family). Contractor designs will be subjected to Design Engineering Tests (DETs) and Design Verification Tests (DVTs). Based on technical performance, technical maturity, and cost, production contracts may be awarded for each family of cartridges. The objective is to qualify two production sources for each cartridge.

In support of the 30x173mm High Explosive Airburst - Tracer (HEAB-T) cartridge (XM1182), the Government anticipates awarding two contracts utilizing an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) through Department of Defense (DoD) Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) to support development and design engineering tests. The Government will down-select and award a single contract to complete Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) in support of Milestone C.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Caliber Ammo for Next Gen Squad Weapons project is a critical technology development in response to the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) Initial Capability Document (ICD) for the ammunition required to support the rapid prototyping, development, and fielding of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) under Section 804 Authority.  The objective is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) the new ammunition.  The NGSW ammunition is split into two initial variants, the General Purpose (GP) and the Special Purpose (SP).  FY 2020 funding supports continuing rapid prototyping/development of the GP projectile, building prototypes and maturing prototypes to provide to the weapon system contractors for performance evaluation, conducting a Critical Design Review (CDR), and conducting prototype testing.  FY 2020 also supports continuing rapid prototyping for the SP projectile, conducting a Preliminary Design Review (PDR), conducting an Initial Product Review (IPR), and performing activities to increase prototype capacity to support planned weapon system testing.  Follow-on NGSW ammunition types include:  tracer ammunition, blank ammunition, reduced range ammunition, and Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK) ammunition.  Development efforts on the follow-on NGSW ammunition variants are scheduled to begin in FY 2022.  FY 2020 supports initial activities to evaluate potential solutions/prototypes and concepts to satisfy follow-on NGSW ammunition requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a course correcting fuze that provides precision accuracy and efficiency for current and future 155mm High Explosive (HE) projectiles by eliminating a portion of the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions which effectively reduces the number of projectiles required to execute fire missions.  PGK utilizes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and internal Guidance and Navigation Computer to accomplish its mission with point detonating and height of burst fuzing functions.  The PGK M1156E1 effort will incorporate and qualify state of the art technologies to increase the functionality of PGK in GPS degraded environments as well as compatibility with the Army's new long range cannon (Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA)) and projectiles which will be fielded during the PGK Life Cycle.  PGK Anti-Jam (PGK-AJ) supports the National Defense Strategy, the Army Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross Functional Team (CFT), future 155mm projectiles and M777 Long Range Cannon (LRC) initiatives.  FY 2020 funding supports the award of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract initiating system design and prototype development for PGK-AJ.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance kit with fuzing functions for 155mm High Explosive (HE) artillery projectiles.  PGK provides near precision accuracy and effectiveness for 155mm HE projectiles.  The PGK corrects the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions and reduces the number of artillery projectiles required to execute the mission.  The current PGK Increment has been qualified for the M795 and M549A1 HE projectiles.  This increment of PGK entered Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) at Milestone C in March 2013.  Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) was completed 3Q FY 2015, Full Material Release (FMR) was approved 1Q FY 2016, Full Rate Production (FRP) decision and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) occurred 2Q FY 2016.  On going PGK Anti-Jam (PGK-AJ) efforts are focused on addressing performance in a GPS degraded environment as well as compatibility with the Army's new long range 155mm cannon and projectile which are scheduled to be fielded in the same timeframe as the next increment of PGK.  The strategy includes competitive DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) concept development efforts with multiple contractors in FY 2017, followed by a DOTC Risk Reduction concept maturation phase in FY 2019.  This will be followed by a competitive Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contractual Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort beginning in FY 2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides system development and demonstration for various projects.  This PE includes the development of water craft, military tactical bridging, material handling equipment, construction equipment, engineer support equipment, soldier support equipment (to include shelter systems, environmental control, field service equipment, camouflage systems and aerial delivery equipment), water purification equipment, petroleum distribution equipment, and mobile electric power.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $4.382 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort #4, Command Post. This line develops the capabilities to improve power generation and distribution within the Army Command Posts which in turn reduces Command Post sustainment requirements.

This project supports the Tactical Electric Power (TEP) program (Generators and Associated Equip) which is established to develop a modernized, standard family of Mobile Electric Power (MEP) systems to include MEP Generating Sources (MEPGS), and MEP Distribution Systems (MEPDS), MEP Storage Systems (MEPSS) and MEP Management Systems (MEPMS) for all Services throughout the Department of Defense IAW DoDI 4120.11. Building on the device/component evaluations conducted in PE 0603804A project G11, this project supports the system development and demonstration of a series of innovative mobile electric power systems that are essential to the development and eventual fielding of modernized MEPGS and MEPDS. This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in Network / Command, Control, Communications &amp; Intelligence (C3I), lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support. FY 2020 funds will continue to develop the Power Distribution Illumination Systems Electrical (PDISE) Expansion which includes the Prime Power Connection Kit (PPCK), and Large Advanced Mobile Power Sources (LAMPS) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), which includes power generation and distribution developmental testing.

Funding supports modernization of the current TEP sources by investigating technology insertions that improve efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and interoperability in support of the Army Operating Concept and Multi-Domain Battle. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational energy concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Power Distribution Illumination Systems Electrical (PDISE) expansion will use a multi-phase acquisition strategy, continue to consolidate requirements and provide solutions to known power distribution gaps. The PDISE expansion will include the current Army power distribution equipment (PDISE), the multi-input Power Distribution Unit (PDU) being developed for use with large tactical electric power generators and the Prime Power Connection Kit (PPCK) and other products to provide the full range of power distribution equipment to support present and future power system requirements.

Large Advanced Mobile Power Sources (LAMPS) Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase: The EMD phase will require the vendor to integrate components and fabricate prototypes, verify prototype performance through contractor testing, deliver production representative generator sets and conduct Instructor and Key Personnel Training (I&amp;KPT) for Government testing. Major data deliverables will include the Technical Data Package (TDP), Integrated Product Support (IPS), test reports and cost data reporting. The Government will purchase the TDP from the vendor with the intent of using it in future competitive re-procurements for LAMPS. A Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Level of Repair Analysis (LORA), Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) and a Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) will be completed to verify that the TDP accurately describes the qualified production sets.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This project develops the tools and processes that will optimize recommendations for the materiel used to establish, operate, and maintain contingency bases. The project will increase the available knowledge at the base level and provide an analytical foundation for sound investment decision making. The continuous improvement modeling and simulation analysis tools will match the evolution of threats and technologies. Using a system of systems engineering approach, the Contingency Base Infrastructure Product Directorate's focus ensures optimum integration of materiel across the base camp to facilitate the maximizing of Warfighter effectiveness.  CBI's analytical results will allow leadership to make data driven, informed decisions on the acquisition and employment/deployment of equipment. This enables contingency bases to be established, operated and managed as a system (system of systems) and the equipment acquired for the base to be compatible and efficient while providing the maximum overall support to the Warfighter. This approach supports Program(s) of Record (PORs) to maximize improvements in Operational Energy and ensures efficiencies across all Areas of Responsibility (AOR).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Maneuver Support Vessel (Light) (MSV(L)) program element supports the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the program. The MSV(L) is a multifunctional waterborne mobility platform, which displaces the current Landing Craft Mechanized-8 (LCM-8).  The LCM-8 does not have the speed, functional draft (shallow water capability), and maneuver capability to move today's Army; cannot transport an Abrams tank. The MSV(L) provides the ability to conduct lift operations of combat loaded personnel and equipment in austere anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environments, with increased speed, payload, and maneuver capability in shallow coastal waters, rivers, in narrow inland waterways in support of dispersed force elements, austere environments and/or where mature ports and road networks are unavailable. This vessel's capability supports transporting multiple combat configured ready-to-fight payloads with crew (i.e. an Abrams tank; or two Strykers with bar armor; or four Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs); or two 20 ft. or one 40 ft. ISO container (Intermodal container); or a Heavy Expandable Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT); or a Load Handling System (LHS), and trailer). The MSV(L) will incorporate new roll-through capability via stern access and bow ramps.  The MSV(L) provides the capability to operate fully loaded at a speed of 18 knots in Beaufort Sea Scale 3 conditions, while being survivable (seaworthy) in Beaufort Sea Scale 7 conditions.  The vessel's force protection attributes includes a subsurface surveillance device for obstacle detection and avoidance, protection from small arms fire, and two Common Remotely Operated Weapon Stations (CROWS II) for vessel defense, and the capacity to mitigate detection through reduction of thermal and acoustic signature.  The MSV(L) provides increased capability that moves combat configured forces and supplies more efficiently than the LCM-8.

Army Watercraft funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, and survivability while increasing the lethality, tactical mobility, and operational capability of the Army Mariner.  Vessel lethality/Escalation of Force measures have increasingly become an area of vital concern to the Combatant Commanders (CCDR) given the requirement to preserve "freedom of the seas" access in all areas of the world, particularly the littorals, to support maneuver operations in all Areas of Responsibility.

FY 2020 Funding supports modernization of the current Army Watercraft Fleet by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vessel electronics, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.  Supports full scale prototype build.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Successful Scale Model Testing completed in Sep 2018.
- Preliminary Design Review held May 2018.
- System Requirements Review held Feb 2018.
- 100 day stop work order issued due to GAO level protest: Contractor resumed work on 24 Jan 2018.
- MSV(L) Contract was awarded on 28 Sep 2017 to Vigor Works, LLC.  
- On 22 Sep 2017, obtained MDA approval for Milestone B and entry into the EMD phase.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MSV(L) will enter at MS B with an EMD Phase, followed by Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).  The acquisition strategy is to have a full and open competition with a down select from paper designs to one contractor at MS B.  The contract will award one 10 year contract to a single vendor comprised of EMD followed by the production and development phase.  Model basin testing will occur after successful execution of PDR. This sequence of events mitigate risks prior to the authorization of building the full size prototype.  The full size prototype will undergo testing which will inform the updated Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) requirements documentation.  Following successful prototype testing, at Knowledge Point (KP) 6, the program will transition to the Other Procurement Army (OPA) funding, and initiate LRIP.  Upon MS C approval, the Government will authorize the Production and Deployment phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>ULCANS provides increased survivability against multi-spectral visual, infrared and radar threats, thermal signature suppression and significant thermal/solar reduction capability. ULCANS is capable of use in all types of weather and climatic conditions except in heavy snow and winds.  ULCANS variants are integrated systems that are very lightweight, easily deployable, versatile, user friendly and tailored to the equipment meeting the requirements of operations for combat systems, command and control equipment, logistic support sites, tactical facilities, and fixed facilities. RDT&amp;E funding for ULCANS Increment I program supports formal development for necessary technology/signature enhancements of three ULCANS Increment I variants (Woodland, Arctic, Desert/Urban) to replace current legacy ULCANS variants (Woodland and Desert).

Funding supports modernization of current camouflage net systems by investigating technology insertions that decrease Soldier and platform detection from threat sensors.  Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of operational requirements and early user feedback to maintain overmatch signature reduction against future threat sensors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the engineering, manufacturing, and development of combat engineer equipment used in support of horizontal and vertical engineer construction missions, and to develop a variety of enabling systems that will support and improve mobility for Engineers in the Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Combat Support Brigade (CSB), and Multi-Roll Bridge Company (MRBC) forces. This project also supports the development of enabling systems to meet critical capabilities of joint interdependence through Air and Ground Line of Communication and Rapid Tactical Earthmoving repair and construction which increase the operational reach of modular forces. Systems that support BCT and CSB forces include: High Mobility Engineer Excavators, Scrapers, Scoop Loaders, Skid Steer Loaders, Dozers, Cranes, Graders and Engineer Rapid Airfield Construction Capability (ERACC).  Systems that support the MRBC included the Hydraulic Excavators (HYEX) and All Terrain Crane.

This project also supports the effort for Construction Equipment Virtual Trainers (CEVTs)  for the first article of each variant. The CEVTs are commercial off the shelf virtual training devices with software modifications for military unique tasks.  These simulators enable the United States Army Engineer School with the capability to more effectively train Engineer Military Occupational Skill (MOS), while reducing maintenance of actual equipment and fuel costs during traditional training.  These simulators provide the Engineer Warfighter with a multitude of training scenarios and continuous hands on training on a variety of construction equipment and in various simulated conditions.  Use of CEVT increases skills and competency in the operation of equipment.The funding will be to perform integration, software development, contractor testing, ICW, CDRLs as well as purchase NRE's.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports engineering, manufacturing, and development of Material Handling Equipment (MHE) including the 5K Light Capability Rough Terrain Forklifts (LCRTF), Rough Terrain Container Handler (RTCH) equipment, All Terrain Lift Army System (ATLAS), and other cargo handling related items to enable Combat Service Support units to rapidly and efficiently move and deliver critical supplies worldwide to the Soldier. Efforts performed under this project include conducting market research, supporting operational requirements identification and validation, conducting trade studies, generating life cycle cost estimates, performing system engineering, developing performance specifications, conducting pre-production test and evaluation, and preparing program management and acquisition documents.

The RTCH a critical enabler of Army logistics support equipment that performs port opening operations, logistics movement, and unloading and loading of containers that handle break-bulk cargo at seaports, railheads, and airports.  The RTCH represents a key enabler during Joint Logistics Over the Shore Operations (JLOTS) and lifts, moves, and stacks 20- and 40-foot ISO freight containers.

The ATLAS enables Terminal Services / Transfer Companies, Ammunition Companies, and Patriot Firing Battery Battalions with capabilities necessary to perform material handling functions up to 10,000lbs during beach, port, and air terminal operations; in material holding areas; and at marshalling yards. The ATLAS provides Commanders with multiple mission capabilities and reliable responsiveness to handle all supply classes supporting three levels of logistics - Strategic, Operational and Tactical.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Early Entry Fluid Distribution System (E2FDS) is a new materiel system that enhances the Inland Petroleum Distribution System (IPDS) pipeline and rapidly establishes new or extends existing pipeline traces. It is a high throughput flexible conduit system for the transport of bulk petroleum or water across the battlefield. It is rapidly-emplaced and capable of a throughput of 850,000 gallons of fuel or 650,000 gallons of raw non-potable water, per a 20 hour operational day through a trace up to 50 miles long. The E2FDS requires little to no engineer support to emplace the conduit or pump stations. Pump stations are fully automated and centrally controlled.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development, demonstration, testing and evaluation within the Combat Engineer and Construction Support Equipment arena. These items include critical life support equipment such as diving, fire fighting, fire suppression, urban and dense urban operations, subterranean operations, breathable air compressors, and emergency and recovery sets along with engineer safety and special unit support equipment and photo support sets.  The Combat Engineer and Construction equipment consists of the Surveying, Firefighting Individual Requirements Equipment Support (FIRES), Fire Protection Equipment Type I, II and III, Tactical Fire Fighting Truck Tools (TFTT), Family of Power Utility Kits (FoPUK), and Soldier Portable Kits, Lineman's Tool Kit, Concrete and Masonry, Electricians, Plumbers, Pipefitters, Family of Light Sets (FoLS), Airfield Damage Repair Kit (ADRK), Diving Equipment, Surface Swimmer Support Sets, Surface Supplied Diving Set, procurement of new Technical/Special Tools, Pioneer Support Set, and the Pioneer Land Clearing and Building Erection Set. Project will explore Additive Manufacturing for Engineer systems. Funding will support the procurement of market samples and testing for Soldier Portable Sets, Kits, and Outfits (SKO), Special Tools initiative, and critical life support equipment such as the Deep Sea Set, Underwater Construction Set, Photo Support Set, Diver Supplemental Issue Set, Closed Circuit Scuba Set, Supervisor Propulsion Emergency and Recovery SCUBA (SPEaRS), Divers' Supplemental Issue Set(DSIS), Vertical Skills Engineer Construction Kit (VSECK), and Family of Boats and Motors (FOBAM).

BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION: These systems provide state-of-the-art deployable, combat engineer and construction equipment and critical life support along with engineer safety and special unit support equipment supporting the joint warfighter.  These programs enhance combat and military operations minimize transportation requirements and reduce the logistical footprint by eliminating obsolete equipment and reducing the number of programs. Funding shall allow for development of dual use systems that support wartime use by Soldiers to include Special Forces and peacetime operations that include national disaster relief and homeland security operations.  Much of this equipment has an inherent short Economic Useful Life (EUL). Investments used to revise, update and obtain equipment within this portfolio has resulted in increased readiness, safety, and effectiveness and reductions in footprint.

Funding supports modernization of the current Ordnance/Engineer equipment by investigating technology insertions due to but not limited to obsolescence and technology innovations. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mobile Maintenance Equipment provides state of the art, deployable, vehicle-mounted, Soldier portable and containerized shelter tool systems supporting the readiness of the Joint warfighter. These systems are equipped with industrial quality tools required for Two Level Maintenance that reduce common tool redundancy, provide tool standardization, minimize transportation requirements, reduce logistical footprint, and are backed by a Lifetime Warranty/Replacement Program which reduces sustainment costs. This is accomplished by employing a system of systems approach to maintenance acquisition. The System of Systems approach builds a maintenance capability upon each system, allowing a logical and natural approach to the Army's overall two level maintenance strategy. These inter-connected systems distributed throughout the Army at multiple levels and echelons provide a holistic repair capability in all scenarios and environments. These systems provide the Maintenance and Combat Commanders an unprecedented capability to repair wheeled, tracked, aviation, ground support and weapons systems on site at one location at one time. This approach to maintenance acquisition increases efficiencies and supports the current force while providing modular configurations designed to meet the specific needs of the Army maintainer in today's complex transforming environment. 

BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION:  The need to develop and maintain a System of System maintenance approach is critical for maintaining readiness due to the growing complexity of today's military equipment, operational tempo, modularity, and current and evolving Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The individual maintenance systems are comprehensive, interconnected and capable of solving and repairing any maintenance problems. The System of Systems approach does not advocate specific tools, methods or practices; instead it seeks to promote a streamlined comprehensive set of systems for solving maintenance challenges where the interactions of doctrine, technology, time and tactics techniques and procedures are the primary drivers.  Funding for projects shall include test article procurement and testing of Soldier portable maintenance SKOs, load banks and refrigeration tool kit; investigation of new technologies for next generation mobile maintenance equipment shop sets including the Shop Equipment Welding (SEW) and Shop Equipment Contact Maintenance (SECM); development of additional Standard Automotive Tool Set (SATS) maintenance modules, Armament Repair Shop Set 2, Mobile Ammunition Processing Facility (MAPF), Special Tools initiatives, shelter mounted system development; packaging development; and technical support for emerging JCIDS materiel requirements documents. Additive Manufacturing upgrades to the Metal Working and Machining Shop Set (MWMSS) to include a 3-D printing and associated digital library capability. Modernization upgrades increase effectiveness while improving efficiency, reliability and maintainability while supporting emerging Army systems as well as using lower cost set components.

Funding supports modernization of the current Ordnance/Engineer equipment by investigating technology insertions due to but not limited to obsolescence and technology innovations. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort #4, Command Post.  Program develops/integrates IECUs supporting the new requirements coming from the Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2), Army Standard Family of Soft Walled Shelters (ASF-SWS) and Army Standard Family of Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF-RWS) Capabilities Development Documents (CDDs).  In addition, supports the development/test of critical Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) modifications required to support the Chemically Protected Deployable Medical System.  

The Improved Environmental Control Units (IECU) program will provide updates that support the new generation of Environmental Control Units (ECUs) that use environmentally approved refrigerants, with zero Ozone-Depleting Chemicals (ODCs) to replace the current Military Standard (MIL-STD) Family of ECUs. The IECUs will provide improved cooling, heating and dehumidification to Soldiers and critical equipment systems in combat, combat support, combat service support units, and combat support hospitals. The IECUs are required to replace currently fielded ECUs in order to comply with statutory and regulatory restrictions on the use of Class II ODCs (such as HCFC-22) and to improve the performance of military ECUs. They are form, fit, and function replacements to the current MIL-STD ECUs. Technical improvements over existing ECUs will yield significant fuel and weight savings, reduction in scheduled maintenance and increased reliability. The new family of IECUs will utilize a new refrigerant which complies with mandated Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Funding supports the development of trailer-mounted systems, shelter system integration, as well as supporting the new ECU requirements coming from the Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2) Army Standard Family of Soft Walled Shelters (ASF-SWS) and Army Standard Family of Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF-RWS) Capabilities Development Documents (CDDs).  In addition, the field has identified an emerging requirement for an integrated fuel-fired /cooling system. These variants will further standardize cooling units in the field, enable cooling of larger shelters and structures, offer increased mobility, and may be used to cool multiple tents with one unit.  Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of operational requirement and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational energy concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) of critical soldier support and sustainment systems that provide more endurance and agility to combat operations enabling success of Army Expeditionary Forces in future multi-domain scenarios.  Project includes highly mobile shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), expeditionary base camp subsystems, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, field heaters, and other combat service support equipment. These systems will fill identified theater capability gaps, improve safety, improve unit sustainability, improve resource and energy efficiency and increase combat effectiveness.  This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Prototyping, and testing of critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, force projection and maintenance platforms. This project develops critical enablers that support the Army Campaign Plan and Army Modernization Strategy by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment while reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This capability is based upon current Army operational requirements for ice which is four pounds per Soldier per day. This capability enables support for up to 900 personnel. Current operations require external support to provide personnel with ice for cooling drinking water in extremely arid environments. This capability will reduce the sustainment risk and cost associated with transporting this commodity from external sources. The objective requirement enables stockage of ice to assist with surge operations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The ASF-RWS program will conduct formal development to incorporate the latest technologies into a fully supportable and modernized family. The intent is to eliminate the proliferation of non-standard shelters and their associated logistics burden, thereby reducing the lifecycle cost of RWS across the Services. The program will produce approved Technical Data Packages (TDPs) to support procurements by materiel developers and Program Managers (PMs) requiring RWS. Once developed and formally type-classified, ASF-RWS procurements are customer funded by PMs as a cost under their program(s). The ASF-RWS will consist of three variants: (1) Expandable/Non-Expandable; (2) Vehicle Mounted; and (3) Panelized/Collapsible with a focus on the following features and improvements: reduced cost, reduced weight, improved energy efficiency, improved corrosion resistance, and improved transportability.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P) supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 1, Unified Network which includes:
The development of a standards-based network architecture that unifies enterprise and deployed network capabilities and features a unified transport layer, network operations and other enabling functions that allows integration of disparate networks. The network provides resiliency through path diversity and dynamic routing to ensure tactical units can communicate in hostile environments. It fully incorporates cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.

JBC-P also supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 2, Common Operating Environment by utilizing:
- Interoperable data, message, and waveforms
- Integration with Joint C4ISR and strike capabilities
- Sensors and applications that enable operations across domains

The Joint Battle Command - Platform program is the cornerstone of Joint Forces Command and Control (C2) Situational Awareness (SA) and communications. JBC-P includes a network which enables the movement of data and provides secure Blue Force Tracking (BFT) capability in Platforms and Command Posts, providing soldiers and commanders a map-based Common Operating Picture of the battlefield, as a result, reducing fratricide.

PdM JBC-P, under PM Mission Command (MC), is collaborating with the Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center's (CERDEC) Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD) on evolving the BFT network. Systems engineering studies/planning activities are underway to develop the evolution path of the BFT network, and the introduction of a Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA). In addition, there are two RDT&amp;E contractual efforts underway for FY 2018 (assess the feasibility of reusing existing BFT-2 transceivers (hardware) and replacing it third party or government owned waveforms), and FY 2019 (assess the feasibility of introducing BFT network resiliency components to existing BFT network). The goal is for all the R&amp;D &amp; experimentation efforts mentioned above, to inform a BFT-3 full and open solicitation (RFP) to industry FY 2020.  

JBC-P RDT&amp;E resources are used to improve JBC-P hardware, network performance and add network resiliency while Mounted Computer Environment RDT&amp;E is used to improve and add software applications.

To better understand how potential changes to the BFT network would affect overall operations, funding was increased in both FY 2017 and FY 2018 to assist PdM JBC-P to fully model the operational BFT network; S&amp;TCD is working on developing a model of the current BFT-2 waveform to test in the BFT portion of their Network Test Lab. This Test Lab provides the Government the ability to test proposed fixes, conduct regression testing of future Software and Firmware releases, and replicate any problems the system may experience without impacting the operational network.

FORSCOM users have identified a need for an expeditionary JBC-P capability to better connect the Lower Tactical Internet (LTI) to the BFT network when dismounted; there is an RDT&amp;E contractual effort underway for FY 2019 to develop a reduced Size Weight and Power (SWaP) dismounted BFT transceiver. PdM JBC-P has partnered with CERDEC's Command, Power and Integration Directorate to develope this capability, along with new power solutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JBC-P Capabilities Development Document in lieu of Capabilities Production Document (CDD ILO CPD) was Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved March 2013. Completed Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) as part of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.2 in 3rd Quarter FY 2013. The IOT&amp;E tested the JBC-P system software on existing FBCB2 hardware (non-dismountable vehicle systems) and future production-representative hardware. On completion of Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Interoperability Test Certification (JITC), MDA authorized Full Rate Production (FRP) in 1st Quarter FY 2014. First unit equipped (FUE) was successfully conducted 3rd Quarter FY 2015.

Developmental efforts are being performed through intra-government collaboration. System engineering efforts are being performed by CERDEC's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD); Command, Power and Integration (CP&amp;I) &amp; the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD). The goal is for all R&amp;D &amp; experimentation efforts to inform a BFT-3 full and open solicitation (RFP) to industry FY 2020.  Hardware along with fielding, training and field support efforts are obtained through existing competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds advanced development of medical materiel within the System Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production portions of the acquisition life cycle using 6.5 (System Development and Demonstration) funding. It supports products successfully developed in the Systems Integration portion of the Systems Development and Demonstration phases through completion of the Milestone C Decision Review. Commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for military use, when available. This PE primarily includes pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials necessary for licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

Projects in this PE include the following:

Project 812 funds military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. These funds provide for engineering and manufacturing development of candidate vaccines and drugs to permit large-scale field testing. Development focused on military unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. Products from this project will normally transition to Department of Defense (DoD) Health Programs or Other Procurement, Army (OPA) Funds.

Project 832 funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. Mature COTS medical products are also evaluated for military use. Consideration will also be given to reduce the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel. Products from this project will normally transition to OPA Funds. 

Project 849 funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for military relevant infectious diseases. These products fall in four major areas: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures to limit exposure and disease transmission. FDA approval is a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members for human use. Products from this project will normally transition to DoD Health Programs or OPA funds. 

Project VS8 program receives products that transition from VS7 and funds effort to complete research and development for the medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) Mission Essential Packages (MEPs) to support 256 Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters. The Army's force design increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  

These Projects are managed by United States (U.S.) Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. Specifically funds pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials or mechanical engineering evaluations for effectiveness of devices or biologics (products derived from living organisms) to fulfill unique military requirements. Consideration is also given to reducing the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel. This work is frequently completed through a laboratory/contractor team with the contractor obtaining the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure for sale of the product.

Major contractors/intra-governmental agencies include: IGR Enterprises, Inc.; Army Medical Department Board Test Center; Se Qual Technologies, Inc.; Enginivity, Inc.; Ultrasound Diagnostician; HemCon Medical Technologies; Cerdak Ltd; Hemerus Medical, LLC; Fast Track Drugs &amp; Biologics, LLC; Integrated Medical Systems, Inc.; the National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI); and the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and Institute of Surgical Research (ISR) for user evaluation. Other military agencies include Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, PEO Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS &amp; CSS), and Naval Undersea Warfare Center.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures (MCM: e.g., vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices) for militarily relevant infectious diseases. This also funds methods to determine if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms thereby posing a risk to service members' and control insect exposure/prevent Warfighters form being bitten by those insects. It funds research that supports conclusive human clinical trials to demonstrate MCM effectiveness safety and related manufacturing tests. This work, which is jointly performed by military laboratories, civilian contracted pharmaceutical firms and foreign research partners, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed. Medical products approved for human use must meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before MCM can be used on Warfighters. Development priority is based upon four major factors: (1) the extent of the disease within the Combatant Commands' theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development, production, and sustainment). Malaria, dysentery, hepatitis, and Dengue diseases (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), which are found in all Combatant Command areas and are at the top of the infectious diseases risks list.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and demonstration of networked munitions, countermine systems, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) render safe, and counter improvised explosive device capabilities. This PE also implements the National Landmine Policy to develop alternatives to the non-self-destructing counter mobility anti-personnel landmine systems. The PE contributes to area access and area denial (A2/AD) to support unified land operations and improve soldier survivability.

Project 016, Close Combat Capabilities, covers three programs:  Dismounted Lane Breaching System (DLBS); Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS); and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Render Safe (EOD RS).  It provides for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and demonstration of capabilities needed for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams to render safe (RS) US and foreign ordnance and improvised explosive devices, enabling ground force commanders to retain freedom of maneuver and secure lines of communications, as well as the Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS).  EOD RS equips EOD teams with low light visual augmentation system, electronic countermeasures, buried IED detection, dismounted X-ray imager, X-ray generator, trace explosive, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), and drug detection, unmanned aerial system, power management, gamma and neutron search and detection, and render safe initiation.  NGABS mission is to enhance the tactical utility and applicability of this bomb suit concept by incorporating modularity/scalability and sensor technologies.  
NGABS will increase the Warfighter lethality and mobility by optimizing Soldier protection for EOD personnel, while effectively managing all life cycle aspects of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  The NGABS will benefit the U.S. industrial base through the NGABS integrated Heads-Up Display (HUD) development which requires extensive collaboration across Protective Equipment and Sensor program offices, industry participants, Military Services and Governmental Agencies.
In FY 2018, this project also included improvements to legacy dismounted lane breaching, specifically the Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS), and in so doing, provided a pathway to the next generation of dismounted lane breaching systems such as the Rapid Assault Lane Line Charge (RALLC) and the Dismounted Explosive Breaching System (DEBS). The efforts addressed capability gaps identified during combat operations and focused on weight reduction, improved scalability, collateral damage reduction, metallic content elimination, deployment accuracy improvement, and increased effectiveness against the current threat.

Project 415, Mine Neutralization/Detection provides for development of next generation standoff, detection, and neutralization capability programs such as Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS), Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS), Vehicle Optics Sensor System (VOSS), Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD), formerly known as the Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS), Route Clearance Vehicles (RCV) and Enablers, Multi-Function Video Display (MVD) and Add on Armor (AoA) kits.   It also supports development of Explosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) capability to neutralize/detonate a broad spectrum of improvised explosive hazards while on the move to support area access route clearance missions.  Provides funding to the Tank Automotive Research Development Engineering Center (TARDEC) Software Engineering Center (SEC) to integrate enhancements and test Explosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) software releases incorporating support for MVD.   

For RCIS Type I, FY 2020 funding supports engineering, logistics development, Full Up System Level prototype delivery and ATEC testing, including the digitized, drive by wire HMEE with the Semi-Autonomous Control (SAC) kit.. 

Project 434, Spider Increment 1A will build upon the existing M7 Spider system.  The M7 Spider system is a hand-emplaced, remotely controlled (Man-In-The-Loop) system that provides highly responsive terrain-shaping and protection capabilities.  M7 Spider replaces persistent anti-personnel landmines, is compliant with US National Landmine policy, and has been fielded to US forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and currently being fielded to Engineers and Brigade Combat Teams in the Active and Army National Guard components.  Additional capabilities will be developed to enhance the Spider Remote Control Station and demonstrate the ability to employ legacy Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) lethal and non-lethal anti-personnel (AP) munitions and counter mobility obstacles.  Spider Increment 1A will utilize an open system architecture to facilitate future munition integration.  FY 2020 funding resources the initiation of the Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) program, which provide an interim Anti-Vehicle (AV) capability to address the Army's directed close tactical obstacle capability gap.  SAVO supports a U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) as well as a revision to the Multiple Delivery Mine System (Volcano) Joint Service Operational Requirement (JSOR).  This capability will allow for the formation of pre-emplaced directed obstacles that can be initiated remotely via fielded wired or wireless initiation systems.  If the emplaced obstacle is not initiated, SAVO can be recovered for future re-deployment.  SAVO consists of a newly developed base from which the existing stock of National Landmine Policy compliant munitions (M87A1 Volcano canisters) can be launched.  SAVO can be initiated through an interface with three fielded systems; the M7 Spider Networked Munition System, the MK152/M156 Remote Activation Munition Systems (RAMS), or the CD450-4J Blasting Machine.  This Program Element (PE) proves for the engineering development of Terrain Shaping Obstacles.  This PE develops alternatives to the Family of Scatterable Mines systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 016, Close Combat Capabilities, covers three programs:  Dismounted Lane Breaching System (DLBS); Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS); and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Render Safe (EOD RS).  It provides for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and demonstration of capabilities needed for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams to render safe (RS) US and foreign ordnance and improvised explosive devices, enabling ground force commanders to retain freedom of maneuver and secure lines of communications, as well as the Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS).  EOD RS equips EOD teams with low light visual augmentation system, electronic countermeasures, buried IED detection, dismounted X-ray imager, X-ray generator, trace explosive, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), and drug detection, unmanned aerial system, power management, gamma and neutron search and detection, and render safe initiation.  NGABS mission is to enhance the tactical utility and applicability of this bomb suit concept by incorporating modularity/scalability and sensor technologies.  NGABS will increase the Warfighter lethality and mobility by optimizing Soldier protection for EOD personnel, while effectively managing all life cycle aspects of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

In FY 2018, this project also included improvements to legacy dismounted lane breaching, specifically the Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS), and in so doing, provided a pathway to the next generation of dismounted lane breaching systems such as the Rapid Assault Lane Line Charge (RALLC) and the Dismounted Explosive Breaching System (DEBS). The efforts addressed capability gaps identified during combat operations and focused on weight reduction, improved scalability, collateral damage reduction, metallic content elimination, deployment accuracy improvement, and increased effectiveness against the current threat.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These improvements will then be incorporated into the technical data package for future procurements.

The Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS) Program is a single-step to full capability acquisition program utilizing full and open competition to ensure best value to the Army. Acquisition strategy for this program is a traditional development program that include an Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase ranging in duration from 24 to 48 months due to the level of design complexity and testing required. Milestone (MS) B / Material Development Decision (MDD) occurred in FY2018 and MS C is scheduled for FY 2020.

The Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Render Safe (RS) program strategy is to acquire commercial and government off-the-shelf systems using Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) contract vehicles and to assemble into a kit with a technical refresh of the kit every three years.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for the next generation of capabilities to detect, identify and neutralize hybrid threats and explosive hazards such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and landmines.  These capabilities are a Family of Systems (FOS) encompassing handheld, vehicle mounted, small robotic mounted, aerial platform mounted and area access, and neutralization systems operating in manned, remotely controlled, semi-autonomous or fully autonomous modes.  Continued development of this FOS is necessary to support Route Clearance Platoons located within both Engineer Companies and Brigade Engineering Battalion Brigade Combat Teams.

The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) is a counter-explosive device capability that provides standoff detection and marking of metallic encased caches and metallic and low-metallic antitank landmines, unexploded ordnance, trigger mechanisms, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of route and area-clearance operations. HMDS is a mission equipment package mounted on the Husky route clearance vehicle. The program was restructured in September 2016 to align with emerging shallow buried Wire Detection (WD) capabilities integrated onto the HMDS Increment A1 configuration (includes Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)). These changes are necessary to adapt to changing IED threats. WD Technology will be fully integrated through Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) at the end of FY20. Prototypes developed under the concluded HMDS Increment A2 effort may be leveraged in development of future capabilities. Future capabilities may include detection of deep buried IEDs and caches, and semi-autonomous control of the Husky vehicle and HMDS from inside a follow-on vehicle.

Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) Type I consists of a semi-autonomous vehicle and includes designated control vehicles and Operator Control Units (OCUs) which provide a standoff capability to detect and neutralize the full spectrum of explosive hazards. Type I integrates a semi-autonomous kit onto a High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE) for remote control from a Buffalo Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle (MPCV). RCIS Type I semi-autonomous kit will be integrated onto the HMEE and be capable of interrogating and classifying explosive hazards. An OCU will be integrated into a Buffalo MPCV for Type I. RCIS capabilities will be fielded to Route Clearance Squads and Engineer Platoons which includes Tele-operation, RADAR-based Follow-Me, LIDAR obstacle detection, onscreen predictive turning map, customizable camera views in order to achieve the RCIS mission. 

For RCIS Type I, FY 2020 funding supports engineering, logistics development, Full Up System Level prototype delivery and ATEC testing, including the digitized, drive by wire HMEE with the Semi-Autonomous Control (SAC) kit. . 
 
The Vehicle Optics Sensor System (VOSS) provides a telescoping, gyro-stabilized, high-resolution, triple sensor (daylight, night-vision, and thermal-imaging) surveillance system to optically detect from standoff distances, explosive hazards (IEDs and landmines) and their trigger sources.  VOSS is mounted on the MMPV Type I for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and MMPV Type II for Engineers.  VOSS will not require RDT&amp;E funding in FY2019 or beyond.  

The Multifunction Video Display (MVD) provides view/control capability of the enablers (Interrogation Arms, VOSS, Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS), Drivers Vision Enhancement, Vehicle Situational Awareness Cameras) in the MMPV Type II to all Operators.  New capabilities will be added into that display to view and control future Unmanned Ground Vehicle Systems (UGVs) programs Route Clearance &amp; Integration System (RCIS) and Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS), Explosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP) Roller and view Unmanned Aerial Vehicles video feeds.  Additional software will need to be developed to add these capabilities.  In addition, a new capability to push the video feeds of all of the enablers (Interrogation Arms, VOSS, Man Transportable Robotic System, Drivers Vision Enhancement and Vehicle Situational Awareness Cameras) from various vehicles within a Route Clearance Patrol will be developed.

Force Protection Improvements/Add On Armor (AoA) to execute system level design cycle for Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) and explosive formed projectiles (EFP) AoA kits for Husky and Buffalo. Kits will be developed so that RPG and EFP protection can be installed at the same time.  In order to do this lighter weight design solutions will be developed.  Given the continued need for these AoA Kits, the schedule has been moved to the left.

Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD), formerly known as the Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS), provides increased survivability through mine and explosive hazards stand-off detection, marking and neutralization capability for the dismounted soldier.  It provides area access and freedom of movement for the Commander.  SREHD consists of payload modules to be mounted on man-portable unmanned ground vehicles.  The payloads are for surface laid and buried threats to include mines and explosive hazards.  This capability allows a soldier to remain in a protective posture while detecting and neutralizing a wide variety of hybrid and conventional explosive threats.  SREHD conducted a successful Milestone (MS) C in April 2018 and initiated Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) in June 2018.  Due to the realignment of funds FY 2020-2024 to higher Army priorities, the proponent withdrew support to the Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) after Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) award.  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) tasks will conclude in FY 2019 under FY 2018 PE 0654808A, Project 415, Landmine Warfare/Barrier - Eng Dev, once corrective action plans and trainer re-development are completed.  The program will conclude in June 2020 under FY 2018 OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) and PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335 for system qualification and production and receipt of LRIP quantities for an orderly program closeout.

FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $17.910 million includes $10.900 million to support the continued development of the Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS); $7.010 million to support development and testing of RCIS Type I.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) program is pursuing an acquisition approach that delivers capability increments - Increment A, Configuration 1 (A1) to the Warfighter by leveraging the Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) currently deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR). In FY2020, the program will complete execution of an Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to add a wire detection capability to address evolving threat, and Infrared illumination to enable nighttime operation, improve operational availability of the HMDS during inclement weather and address obsolescence and Cyber Security deficiencies.

The Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) program executes an Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase for Type I systems with an OEM contract award for Delta High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE) support and a contract award  in 4QFY2018 to one EMD contractor for the Semi-Autonomous Control (SAC) Kit .  The SAC Kit was awarded based on a source selection from full and open competition.  The SAC EMD contract awardee will execute Preliminary Design Review (PDR), design, integration, and build phase of seven Semi-Autonomous Capability (SAC) kits, integrated onto six vehicles, with one kit available for engineering and System Integration Lab (SIL) evaluations.  These assets enable the Government to execute a full Pre-Production Qualification Test (PPQT) and to evaluate against Capability Production Document (CPD) and performance specification requirements. Production and Technical Data Package (TDP) procurement options on the EMD contract take advantage of competition to assist in cost reduction. The RCIS Type I program Lifecycle Cost Estimate (LCCE), and associated budget request, was updated based on costs associated with modifying the base HMEE platform to accept the SAC kit, changes in the acquisition strategy and alignment of development and test activities in support of a production decision. To support EMD, ALUGS is funding Reset/Recap of four Buffalo Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle (MPCV) test assets at Letterkenny Army Depot.  These will be provided to the SAC contractor for Operator Control Unit (OCU) integration.  

The Vehicle Optics Sensor System (VOSS) program has no planned activities in FY 2019 or beyond.

Spiral development of software upgrades to MVD will be procured in FY 2018 and FY 2019.  Additional funding will be required to support the remote visualization capability in the FREHD CDD.

The Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) (formerly known as AMDS) is currently in the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase to provide standoff detection, marking, and neutralization of explosive hazards (e.g., landmines, improvised explosive devices (IED), booby-traps (explosive), and unexploded ordnance (UXO)) in complex and urban terrain, including confined areas and subterranean environments (e.g., buildings, bunkers, tunnels, etc.).  Transition to Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) occurred 30 April 2018 under PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335, for the neutralization capability, as well under OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) for the detection and marking capabilities.  Due to the realignment of funds FY 2020-2024 to higher Army priorities, the proponent withdrew support to the Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) after Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) award.  Subsequently, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) directed that FY 2019 funding will not be executed for this program.  Due to timing, funding is still reflected in FY 2019.  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) tasks will conclude in FY 2019 under FY 2018 PE 0654808A, Project 415, Landmine Warfare/Barrier - Eng Dev, once corrective action plans and trainer re-development are completed.  The program will conclude in June 2020 under FY 2018 OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) and PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335 for system qualification and production and receipt of LRIP quantities for an orderly program closeout.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ScheduleDetailNote>Due to the realignment of funds FY 2020-2024 to higher Army priorities, the proponent withdrew support to the Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) after Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) award.  Subsequently, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) directed that FY 2019 funding will not be executed for this program.  Due to timing, funding is still reflected in FY 2019.  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) tasks will conclude in FY 2019 under FY 2018 PE 0654808A, Project 415, Landmine Warfare/Barrier - Eng Dev, once corrective action plans and trainer re-development are completed.  The program will conclude in June 2020 under FY 2018 OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) and PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335 for system qualification and production and receipt of LRIP quantities for an orderly program closeout.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Spider Increment 1A will build upon the existing M7 Spider system.  The M7 Spider system is a hand-emplaced, remotely controlled (Man-In-The-Loop) system that provides highly responsive terrain-shaping and protection capabilities.  M7 Spider replaces persistent anti-personnel landmines, is compliant with US National Landmine policy, and has been fielded to US forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and currently being fielded to Engineers within Brigade Combat Teams in the Active and Army National Guard components.  Additional capabilities will be developed to enhance the Spider Remote Control Station and demonstrate the ability to employ legacy Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) lethal and non-lethal anti-personnel (AP) munitions and counter mobility obstacles. Spider Increment 1A will utilize an open system architecture to facilitate future munition integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Tactical Command and Control Hardware &amp; Software funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Lines of Efforts LOE 1 - Unified Network; LOE 1 - Network Enabling Functions; LOE 2 - Common Operating Environment; LOE - Interoperability, LOE 4 - Command posts.  Further detail provided in R2A.     

Project 323, the Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 Network Enabling Functions. CHS is a designated Army Strategic Source that acquires and sustains highly flexible, cost effective, and simplified non developmental C4ISR solutions that integrates the latest and emerging commercial technology onto the Converged Mission Command Network. 

CHS provides technical support, environmental and survivability testing, system design, end of life/configuration management, and strengthens cyber security/supply chain risk management across Army tactical programs to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the computing infrastructure. CHS continuously analyzes and tracks hardware from cradle-to-grave, from emerging technology until end-of-life. CHS conducts hardware evaluations that facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across numerous Army programs and agencies including: Mission Command; Tactical Network; Tactical Radios; Distributed Common Ground Station Army; Aviation Systems; Counter Rocket, Artillery, Mortar; Communication Electronics Command; Communications Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Command, among others. CHS rapidly procures common hardware configurations across the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), Common Operating Environment (COE), the sustainment community, and tactical programs that enables the continuous modernization in support of all four Network Modernization Lines of Effort and future Network CFT experimentation. CHS logistical services include worldwide 72 hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, tailorable supply chain and cybersecurity measures, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements. CHS supports better buying power initiatives by creating efficiencies through economies of scale, price breaks, streamlined processes, reduced cycle times, and centralized contracting.
 
Project 334, the Common Software (CS) program, is the suite of systems through which the Army develops, integrates and tests common software products and/or components used for communication between Army Mission Command Systems and Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Mission Command (MC) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort. The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems. The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's COE modernization efforts. There is no FY20 RDTE funding since Common SW will be transitioning into sustainment in FY19.
 
Project C29, the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF), is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of system verification/validation checkout, testing, and configuration management for the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. The Centralized Technical Support Facility (CTSF) funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort LOE 1B Network Enabling Functions.

Project C34 supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. The Army Tac C2 Sys Eng project funds the PEO Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Technical Management Division (TMD), which effectively manages the System-of-Systems engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts for the continuing evolution of the network within the PEO C3T portfolio of technology across the capability enhancement packages to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solutions.  

Project EJ4, the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), is one of the computing environments under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative, a major Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort of the Network Cross-Functional Team (N-CFT). CPCE provides a common software infrastructure framework (common interface, data, and services) upon which future Warfighter capabilities can be built. CPCE development efforts initially target Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA) capability development at tactical echelons that span from Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to Battalion level. The CPCE will be the central computing environment developed to support command posts and combat operations, and will be interoperable with Mounted and Mobile/Handheld systems.

Project EJ5, the Mounted Computing Environment (MCE), is one of the six computing environments (CEs) formalized by the AAE under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative. MCE standardizes end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications while leveraging existing hardware under the Joint Battle Command - Platform program. Requirements for the MCE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the draft Mounted Computing Environment Requirements Definition Package (RDP 1). FY20 funding provides the means to continue to manage and develop MCE in concert with the Army's future COE strategy.

Project EJ6, Tactical Enhancement supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Sight and beyond line of sight radio systems. In addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current WIN-T SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti- jam capability and resiliency to WIN-T Program of Record satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on WIN-T satellite modems.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY28/29). The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events. 
 .
Project EK9, Unified Network Operations (UNO) will deliver an integrated Network Operations (NetOps) capability, based upon an open framework, aggregating data, which enables common planning, configuration, management, monitoring, and defense of the Network. This will be accomplished through the integration, co-hosting, and federation of multiple NetOps systems from the hand held devices to the Enterprise. UNO aligns with the Army's intent to develop NetOps prototypes, conduct development operations (DevOps), get user feedback, make adjustments and ultimately deliver enhanced capabilities to the operational force in the shortest time possible using what is available in industry or through other government agencies through an adapt and buy approach based on experimentation and demonstration.

Project ER9, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2), fields mobile Command Post Nodes by integrating supporting mission command solutions in accordance with Directed Requirement with a FY20 First Unit Equipped in order to enhance the survivability and mobility of brigade and below command post formations. On order, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure will replace selected elements of the legacy command post to provide improved expeditionary capability, survivability, agility, and scalability for Corps and Division Main and Tactical Command Posts, Brigade Main and Tactical Command Posts, and Battalion Command Posts. It will ensure information and support systems are introduced into the Command Post through physical integration allowing the commander to tailor the Command Post as missions dictate.

Project EQ8, Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment, supports the Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program.  The program leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations.  The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader.  

Project EW3, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR),supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. UTR is the process performed by the S6 and their staff to affect change on the network in order to support the operational mission and dynamic nature of the Army.  Currently network challenges exist during this process with regard to:  maintaining accurate and up to date information,  distributing configuration files and activating / re-establishing the network.  UTR strives to make authoritative NETOPS Data available across all systems, reduce cognitive burden for soldiers to plan and manage the network and reduce manual touch labor.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 323, the Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 Network Enabling Functions. CHS is a designated Army Strategic Source that acquires and sustains highly flexible, cost effective, and simplified non developmental C4ISR solutions that integrates the latest and emerging commercial technology onto the Converged Mission Command Network. 

CHS provides technical support, environmental and survivability testing, system design, end of life/configuration management, and strengthens cyber security/supply chain risk management across Army tactical programs to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the computing infrastructure. CHS continuously analyzes and tracks hardware from cradle-to-grave, from emerging technology until end-of-life. CHS conducts hardware evaluations that facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across numerous Army programs and agencies including: Mission Command; Tactical Network; Tactical Radios; Distributed Common Ground Station Army; Aviation Systems; Counter Rocket, Artillery, Mortar; Communication Electronics Command; Communications Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Command, among others. CHS rapidly procures common hardware configurations across the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), Common Operating Environment (COE), the sustainment community, and tactical programs that enables the continuous modernization in support of all four Network Modernization Lines of Effort and future Network CFT experimentation. CHS logistical services include worldwide 72 hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, tailorable supply chain and cybersecurity measures, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements. CHS supports better buying power initiatives by creating efficiencies through economies of scale, price breaks, streamlined processes, reduced cycle times, and centralized contracting.

CHS is a model for modern acquisition strategy that provides hardware solutions including servers, storage, clients, networking devices, ruggedized platforms, hand held end devices, operational transit cases, installation kits, and peripheral devices, procured from 65 small and 40 large businesses. CHS is partnered with the CECOM Integrated Logistics Support Center (ILSC) to develop a model for sustaining COTS IT using the Standard Army Supply System. CHS uses a Public Private Partnership (P3) with Tobyhanna Army Depot in order to leverage the innovation, resources and leadership skills of both TYAD and CHS in order to provide the best value to the Soldier.

CHS supports Better Buying Power (BBP) initiatives by creating efficiencies on a micro and macro level through volume discounting, economies of scale, the elimination of duplication of effort, reduced barriers to entry, price breaks, streamlined processes, reduced cycle times, and centralized contracting. CHS provides the Army with a highly efficient Return on Investment (ROI), approximately 33:1, having provided customer PMs with validated cost avoidances of nearly $800 Million since FY14.

FY 2020 funds support CHS to continue enabling the streamlined and rapid acquisition and delivery of CHS equipment and associated logistical services in support of customer requirements. It will support technology insertions and enable hardware and systems engineering, and evaluations. FY20 requirements support the initiation of CHS 6 contract pre award activities and CHS Information Systems infrastructure - Common Hardware Systems-Rapid Acquisition and Procurement Integrated Database System (CHS-RAPIDS).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 334 Common Software (CS): CS is the suite of systems through which the Army develops, integrates and tests common software products and/or components used for communication between Army Mission Command Systems and the greater Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) community. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous C4ISR and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort. The CS program is the hub of interoperability for the Army's current C4ISR systems.

FY18 funding supports any remaining adjustments to ensure backwards compatibility with previous versions of Common Software products implementations.

There is no funding past FY18 since CS will be transitioning into sustainment in FY19.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The overall acquisition goal of the CS project is to provide common products that are used horizontally across programs, preventing duplication of effort by Army and Joint programs and facilitating life cycle cost efficiencies. All software development efforts will be competed among Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) certified developers.

In accordance with the approved Net-enabled Mission Command Initial Capabilities Document (NeMC ICD), software capability will be developed in 3-year increments to facilitate messaging, mediation and addressing for Army, Joint and Coalition Partners. The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the C4ISR systems, and a core communication component of the virtualized infrastructure and will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command (PM MC) General Services Administration (GSA) engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on a single development solicitation. This strategy is designed to optimize opportunities for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition, and to ensure the rapid integration of new capabilities into warfighter systems. This strategy is also designed to reduce the physical footprint, the logistics support requirements, and to increase operational efficiency by integration of additional system interoperability services which reduce duplication of effort and cost; and allows for development of communication standards across the DoD community.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project C29, The Centralized Technical Support Facility (CTSF) supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort LOE 1 Network Enabling Functions.

The Central Technical Support Facility's (CTSF) directed mission is to perform Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) testing and configuration management for all operational through tactical level Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems (individual, family, and system of systems), applications, and hardware prior to release to the field.  The CTSF accomplishes this through the enforcement of a standards based architecture while supporting the development and implementation of an integrated computing infrastructure and a converged network.  The CTSF functions as the CIO/G6's designated independent test agent and Land/WarNet/Mission Command (LWN/MC) configuration manager. The CTSF provides validated test data to the Department of the Army and Joint agencies to accredit interoperability certifications. The distributed test environment of the CTSF is accomplished through the Federation of Net-centric Sites (FaNS) construct. This FaNS construct addresses distributed integration development and testing using the core infrastructure of the CTSF to harness Army and Joint expertise/resources. Through these federated resources, the CTSF executes or supports interoperability development, integration and certification testing of the systems and system of systems in the Warfighter Mission Area, to include Network Evaluation spinouts, as they become part of the Army's LandWarNet. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Project C34, Army Tactical Command and Control Systems Engineering: This project funds the PEO Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Technical Management Division (TMD) System of Systems engineering and integration, experimentation, acquisition management, testing, fielding and sustainment support to ensure interoperability and affordability within the PEO C3T portfolio. The TMD focuses on System-of-Systems (SoS) Engineering and Integration for the Mission Command Network with increased emphasis on immediate Warfighter needs as well as leveraging emerging technologies. Fiscal Year 2020 will focus on the continued development, implementation and integration of the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) network architectures. This includes development of a technology enhancement roadmap for SoS capability evolution across the PEO C3T portfolio that incorporates Cross Functional Team initiatives; network integration support and design products for system validation through various N-CFT lead experimentation and integration testing; integration of tactical Networked capabilities for all Mission Command Network systems, initial fieldings, and integration events; integration of tactical information assurance solutions and security measures for consistent cyber protection; and support to N-CFT evaluations and contract actions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Operating Environment (COE) is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enables secure and interoperable applications to be developed and executed rapidly across a variety of computing environments (i.e., server(s), client, mobile, sensors, and platform).  The Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) is one of the six computing environments under the COE, which provides the movement and maneuver applications, common computing services such as Cyber tools and e-mail, and includes tactical server capabilities within Command Posts at all echelons (Battalion to Army Service Component Commander).

Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 2, Common Operating Environment

The CPCE implements an integrated, interoperable, cyber-secure, cost-effective software infrastructure that serves as the host for a unified set of multiple warfighting functional applications within the command post. This software infrastructure will be central to the COE, allowing interoperability between command posts, mounted platforms, and dismounted handheld devices while supporting collaboration using a common picture with Joint and Unified Action partners. CPCE will provide a core software infrastructure including a common operating picture (COP) tool, common look and feel (user interface), common data strategy, interoperable tactical messaging/chat, and essential movement and maneuver capabilities. CPCE software infrastructure and applications will reside on Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) hardware and previously fielded BCCS/TSI servers. The CPCE eliminates "stove-piped" legacy systems, duplicative or redundant implementations, simplifies future application development efforts, and enhances interoperability and data sharing across multiple echelons.  Acquisition Goals of the CPCE include: Acquisition Agility, Open System Architectures, Reduced Life Cycle Costs, and a Cyber-Hardened Foundation for applications and services.

The initial version of CPCE completed Initial Operational Test and Evaluation at NIE 18.2 in November 2018, a Fielding / Software Deployment decision is targeted for 2QFY19 along with entering the acquisition life cycle.  The new program of record will be comprised of the tactical server infrastructure, Mission Command software infrastructure, and movement/maneuver Warfighting function applications.  First Unit Equipped in 4QFY19.

Requirements for the CPCE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the CPCE Requirements Definition Package (RDP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CPCE supports the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE).  It will provide foundational capabilities and services for command post software infrastructure, movement and maneuver applications, tactical DCO infrastructure capabilities and warfighting function applications. The Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) hardware will host the CPCE core infrastructure and warfighting function applications.

The initial version of CPCE (v3) meets Minimum Essential Capabilities (MECs) as codified in the approved Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2) Directed Requirement. The initial version of CPCE completed Initial Operational Test and Evaluation at NIE 18.2 in November 2018, a Fielding / Software Deployment decision is targeted for 2QFY19 along with entering the acquisition life cycle.   The new program of record will be comprised of the tactical server infrastructure, Mission Command software infrastructure, and movement/maneuver Warfighting function applications.  First Unit Equipped in 4QFY19.

The CPCE is an integration effort consisting of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf / Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) software and Government-developed software that allows for backwards compatibility and development of warfighting capability applications.

Government partners include the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Weapons Software Engineering Center (WSEC), Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Software Engineering Center (SEC), Aviation and Missiles Research and Development Center (AMRDEC) Software Engineering Directorate (SED) and Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  Commercial suppliers are assigned efforts through GSA Mission Command Engineering Services vehicles and Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contracts. Hardware, core software and associated licenses to support converged system architecture is Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and procured through existing vehicles from GSA, Common Hardware Systems (CHS) and the Army Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Operating Environment (COE) is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enables secure and interoperable applications to be developed and executed rapidly across a variety of computing environments (i.e., server(s), client, mobile, sensors, and platform).  The Mounted Computing Environment (MCE) is one of six computing environments under the COE, which provides standardization of end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications while leveraging existing hardware under the Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) program.

The Mounted Computing Environment supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 2, Common Operating Environment by utilizing:
- Interoperable data, message, and waveforms
- Sensors and applications that enable operations across domains
- Integration with Joint C4ISR and strike capabilities

Requirements for the MCE are established in the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC)-approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the Mounted Computing Environment Requirements Definition Package (RDP). FY20 funding provides the means to continue to manage and develop MCE in concert with the Army's future COE strategy.

Mounted Computing Environment RDT&amp;E resources are used to improve and add software applications while JBC-P RDT&amp;E is used to improve JBC-P hardware, network performance and add network resiliency.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MCE supports the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE), and will serve as the future software for Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P). The JBC-P program provides the hardware and network, while JBC-P software will be replaced with MCE. Future development will continue to leverage JBC-P hardware and MCE software and integrate multiple warfighting systems into the platform (mounted) environment.

MCE is being developed over time, with the initial set of v3 Minimum Essential Capabilities (MECs) being delivered in 4QFY19. Subsequent deliveries of capabilities are expected on a 5 year cycle, in accordance with the AROC approved COE IS ICD. This cycle may be adjusted depending on many factors, including fielding priorities, effectiveness of backwards compatibility, and time required to develop and test new capabilities.

To accomplish the goals of the MCE, PEO C3T PM MC architects, designs, and develops the hardware, software, network solutions and capabilities required to achieve compliance with the COE. Primary systems architecture engineering is conducted by in-house Government engineering staff with contracted support, matrix elements and MITRE Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center. Test and Evaluation support is provided by in-house PM MC TMD staff, with support from contractor firms, for preparation and conduct of specific risk reduction events and test events. Developmental testing is being conducted by the software development teams with Government oversight and coordination. IOT&amp;E efforts will be supported by the ATEC community. Hardware to support system architecture and software development is comprised of standardized equipment and is procured using existing contract vehicles such as Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EJ6,  the Tactical Enhancement supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line Of Effort (LOE) 1 - Unified Network 

Tactical Enhancement supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Sight and beyond line of sight radio systems. 

In addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current WIN-T SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti- jam capability and resiliency to WIN-T Program of Record satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on WIN-T satellite modems.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY28/29). The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events. 

SIGMOD Capabilities: 
TRILOS: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS).  TRILOS will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) radio verses the aging HCLOS system. 
TROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System.  TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth.

FY20 funds support NCW-R developmental testing effort to add a projected satellite communication capability to tactical network</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>These funds will be used to conduct System Evaluation and Formal Testing of the various Signal Mod capabilities, specifically the TROPO and Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) systems. This is in order to facilitate integration into the WIN-T tactical networks. These test events will meet all mandatory testing requirements with full ATEC oversight. This Acquisition Strategy will integrate proven Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) capabilities into existing WIN-T nodes to expand and enhance network capacity and user access. The TROPO and TRILOS capabilities are acquired as ACAT III programs to replace legacy equipment in the field while utilizing DoDI 5000.02 standard acquisition approaches, starting with Milestone C Determination for TRILOS (3QFY17) and TROPO (4QFY18).


The Army will continue NCW-R development in FY19 and conduct developmental testing beginning in 2nd quarter FY20, followed by certification for operational use over Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites by Army Space and Missile Defense Command. The Army projects to begin fielding this improved, resilient, satellite communication waveform in 4th Quarter FY20.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Line of Effort 1A: Unified Network (Tactical Network Operations (NetOps) Management (TNOM))

Unified Network Operations (UNO) will leverage MTA (Mid-Tier Acquisition) (Section 804) rapid prototyping efforts to develop UNO v1.0 via NetOps capabilities that build upon current efforts, expand those efforts to address CSA priorities, and include emerging capability requirements stemming from Network Cross Functional Team (CFT) initiatives and requirements.  

UNO will operationally standardize, integrate, and simplify NetOps capabilities existing at the enterprise/strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

UNO will deliver an integrated Network Operations (NetOps) capability, based upon an open framework, aggregating data, which enables common planning, configuration, management, monitoring, and defense of the Network. This will be accomplished through the integration, co-hosting, and federation of multiple NetOps systems from the hand held devices to the Enterprise. UNO aligns with the Army's intent to develop NetOps prototypes, conduct DevOps, get user feedback, make adjustments and ultimately deliver enhanced capabilities to the operational force in the shortest time possible using what is available in industry or through other government agencies through an adapt and buy approach based on experimentation and demonstration.

FY20 funding will continue support of MTA (Mid-Tier Acquisition) (Section 804) rapid prototyping efforts of UNO v1.0 via capabilities that will be expanded upon based on Network CFT initiatives and directed requirements. UNO v1.0 will be comprised of Network Management, Integrated Planner, Radio Planner, and Federated Data Repository capabilities that utilize the try, buy, decide strategy put forth by Army leadership. The UNO Program Office Management will utilize FY20 funding in support of requisite planning, documentation, and management functions in support of rapid prototyping efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Support delivering integrated capabilities to plan, install, operate, maintain, and secure the Army?s end-to-end network in support of the commander?s mission priorities. 

Capabilities UNO will expand based upon Network CFT initiatives and requirements are Network Management, Integrated Planner, Radio Planner, and Federated Data Repository utilizing the try, buy, decide strategy put forth by Army leadership. 

Development of UNO's Radio Planner capability provides the ability to plan and create configuration files as well as manage the latest Tactical radio elements of the Department of Defense Information Network ? Army (DoDIN-A) and monitoring focused on the status of mission network services effectivity. 

Development of the UNO's Network Management function will provide the ability to manage and troubleshoot the network elements that comprise the DoDIN-A, monitor a local node for network health status, performance, location, and security, in addition to displaying monitored data to the local operator. Management elements include, but are not limited to, the Command Post, Brigades, Echelons, etc. 

UNO's improvement of the Integrated Planner functionality allows NetOps capabilities to plan, manage and operate the Tactical Internet DoDIN-A with common operating picture, automate the planning functions and the resource management to support unit task organization, and interface with managers and monitors.

Initial implementation of UNO's Federated Data Repository enables unit task reorganization (UTR) acting as the distributed data store for NetOps data and provide services that will be used by NetOps planning and management systems and a federated data store that operates over existing Army Tactical networks, typically characterized as a Disconnected, Intermittent and Bandwidth Limited (DIL) operating environment.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EQ8 - The Common Operating Environment (COE) is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enables secure and interoperable applications to be developed and executed rapidly across a variety of computing environments. The Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment (M/HH CE) is one of the six computing environments under the COE, which provides the standards for all Army hand held applications enabling the use of common End User Devices by Soldiers, thereby eliminating redundant devices and reducing the Soldiers' load.

The M/HH CE supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 (Unified Network) and LOE 2 (Common Operating Environment) by utilizing (1) interoperable data, message, and waveforms, (2) sensors and applications that enable operations across domains and (3) integration with Joint C4ISR and strike capabilities. Nett Warrior (NW) complies with the technical standards documented by the M/HH CE and provides the dismounted common computational platform for other products relevant to dismounted Soldiers. Through compliance with the M/HH CE, software applications from other programs are integrated with the NW system, reducing the need for duplicate hardware and resulting in reduced Soldier Load. NW leverages commercial smart phone devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness for use during combat operations. NW applied feedback from conventional and Special Operations units to procure and implement Secure but Unclassified (SBU) networking equipment for Security Force Assistance Brigades to enable faster, more flexible Mission Command data exchanges with Joint and Coalition forces while maintaining the existing integrated mission command capability with Joint Battle Command Platform systems. NW uses Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Non Developmental (NDI) communications equipment to create a robust and flexible SBU network that enables faster and more accurate decision making in fights at the tactical level.

Requirements for the M/HH CE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the draft M/HH CE Requirements Definition Package (RDP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To capitalize on commercial industry's investment in advanced smart device technology as well as innovation and changes within Army, NW requires annual RDT&amp;E funding for integration and evaluation of new technology. Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures.  The Nett Warrior (NW) program provides situational awareness and mission command to dismounted combat leaders through a secure commercial smart device, power source, cables and the Integrated Tactical Network.  NW funds development and evaluation of new technology and software integration through a combination of competitively awarded contracts.  Various existing follow on procurement contracts are utilized to procure a combination of COTs and GOTs NW equipment to include supporting services.  NW program completed LRIP/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&amp;E under DOT&amp;E oversight in 4QFY14- 1QFY15. This IOT&amp;E event led to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision in FY17. Now in production, NW aggressively seeks operational feedback and, using the DevOps process, identifies and implements capability improvements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Expeditionary Army Command Post funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 4:  Command Post 

The Command Post initiative is to implement capabilities that enable the Army to employ command posts across the operational spectrum, from early entry to major combat operations, and that resolve current issues with set up and tear down, survivability, mobility, suitability and footprint. This Line of Effort (LOE) will focus on developing and obtaining approval of requirements for integrated command posts, then delivering these integrated command post designs to Army units.

The CPI2 program addresses the requirements for more mobile, scalable, interoperable, and agile command posts. Current stationary command posts are deemed too large and take too long to setup and teardown making them vulnerable to near peer detection and targeting technologies. By integrating mission command warfighting functions on to formation appropriate vehicle platforms, a dispersed command post construct will enable the battle staff to blend in with the overall maneuver formation while giving the commander the ability to synchronize the close fight on the move. This dispersed mobile command post consists of Mission Command Platforms (MCPs) and Command Post Support Vehicles (CPSVs). The MCP is a formation appropriate vehicle that provides digital workstations for all mission command warfighting functions. The CPSV is the hub of the dispersed command post; it hosts mission command servers, radios, local area network components and a secure wireless capability.

The CPI2 Materiel Development Decision Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed on 21 June 2018 and directs CPI2 to be executed in a two increment approach. Increment 1 will develop capabilities to address needs identified in the signed Command Post (CP) Directed Requirement (DR) while Increment 2 will execute requirements as identified in the emerging CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD).  Using the buy, try, assess, and decide improved acquisition model which leverages user experimentation to inform follow on program requirements, Increment 1 will prototype and integrate available commercial off the shelf and government programs of record (PORs) that provide mission command and communications functions within the command post. Subsequently, CPI2 will initiate Increment 2 based on an emerging CDD to replace legacy command post systems at Corps, Division, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) and their subordinate Battalion formations.

FY20 funding provides for the design engineering, prototype manufacturing, and integration efforts for BCTs, with a government solution for First Unit Equipped and an industry solution for the following BCTs. FY20 funding also delivers an experimental Mobile Command Group formation to 1 Corps/Division.  Funding includes obtaining the required MCP/CPSV vehicle platforms and Command Post infrastructure systems. In FY20, CPI2 will conduct several training and test events that will provide user assessments on all experimental solutions to inform future design updates and program requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CPI2 Increment 1 will work with the government and with industry to capitalize on their experiences with mobile Command Posts to perform risk reduction events on experimental solutions for the Command Post Support Vehicle and Mission Command Platform as outlined in the Command Post Directed Requirement (DR). 

CPI2 will develop the first BCT set through experimentation conducted at Research, Development, Engineering, Command (RDECOM) via a Functional Support Agreement (FSA) for the First Unit Equipped (FUE) for BCT #1.  Additionally, CPI2 will leverage industry advancements and innovation using full and open competition with the C5SIR Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to design and prototype the MCP/CPSV for the second BCT set.  Finally, CPI2 will deliver an experimental Mobile Command Group formation to 1 Corps/Division. FY20 will culminate with test events on all prototype designs, leading to a Milestone C in FY21 to select the Command Post (CP) solution set for fielding the remaining 3 BCTs and 1 Corps/Division identified in the CP DR.

The CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD) is projected to re-enter JCIDS staffing in FY19, which will specify the requirements for the CPI2 Increment 2. Increment 2 will execute a competitive contract award planned based on Request For Proposal (RFP) responses and source selection process. This contract is projected to be a 5 year Firm Fixed Priced/Cost Plus Fixed Fee (FFP/CPFF) contract for the design, engineering, prototyping, Developmental Test (DT), New Equipment Training (NET), one Limited User Test (LUT), and one Operational Test (OT) which will encompass CPI2 variants at Corps, Division, and Brigade and Battalion echelons with Option Years for production.

Where needed, CPI2 will leverage existing contracts managed by Project Manager (PM) Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Project Manager (PM) Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and Project Manager (PM) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) for integration efforts associated with their respective platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This system is a component of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and will provide for an incrementally fielded Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System/capability for the composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades.  The Sentinel system is a key component of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) architecture and provides critical air surveillance of the forward areas.

Sentinel (AN/MPQ-64A3) consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command, Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces. The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 kilometers.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission &amp; System Description:

This system is a component of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and will provide for an incrementally fielded Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System/capability for the composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades.  The Sentinel system is a key component of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) architecture and provides critical air surveillance of the forward areas.

Sentinel (AN/MPQ-64A3) consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command, Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces. The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 kilometers.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.

The Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization/upgrades, hardware/software issue resolution, resolution of obsolescence issues, engineering studies, and cost reduction initiatives.  The funding for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 through FY 2024 development activities addresses the following Sentinel system capability gaps and obsolescence issues identified by the User:  1) Target Detection gap; 2) Target Tracking gap; 3) Net Readiness gap; 4) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) gap; 5) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Defense gap; and 5) Rockets, Artillery &amp; Mortars (RAM) gap. 


FY 2020 Funds address the following:

Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect (EA/EP) addresses the electronic countermeasures (ECM) gap.  This effort continues through the life of the radar, addressing both changing threats and electronic counter measure gaps.

The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) (Sentinel A4) is the next generation of radar technology to replace the current phase and frequency scanned array used by Sentinel today.  The AESA Antenna will provide increased capability including extended range for ground-based surveillance and situational awareness, faster and more accurate Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) for clearing fires and preventing fratricide, improved Fire Control (FC) quality track accuracy, and management of larger track loads.  The AESA will also provide improved operation in severe/urban clutter.  The system will detect and track small targets, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles, in clutter and will detect and track slow targets, such as UAS and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft, at low altitudes in clutter.  The system will detect, track, and classify Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats and will support Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) requirements and can contribute sensor support for mitigating current and future Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 mission requirements.

Mode S upgrade to existing Sentinel Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) will address Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate IFF mode S which is currently not being met.  Mode S transmissions are a key component of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) surveillance technology being used by the Federal Aviation Administration for tracking aircraft as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  In the United States, all aircraft required to have transponders (most aircraft) must transition to Mode S capable units by 2020.  Without the Mode S upgrade, Sentinel will have to rely on these aircraft transponders responding to the legacy mode 3/A interrogations.  The data available in the Mode S response will be valuable in identifying the aircraft and correlating Sentinel tracks with civil aviation tracks/data and other track data sources. Addresses the M Code Global Positioning System (GPS) capability requirement with the new interrogator.

Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) upgrade to counter emerging threats and provide the Operational Commander Assured Position Navigation and Timing capabilities.  Sentinel SW will be updated to accept new RSAM messages and provide RSAM status to the Radar operator. 

Counter Rocket, Artillery &amp; Mortars (C-RAM) capability increase to current Sentinel A3's effectiveness against the Low, Slow, Small (LSS) and RAM threat.  This effort develops and implements advanced waveforms and processing to significantly enhance RAM capabilities.  These efforts will provide fire control quality data to support RAM interceptors.


Additional Development:

Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) addresses the Target Detection, Target Tracking, and Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability gaps and funds the mitigation of the SDP and NFM obsolescence issues. SDP cards are estimated to go obsolete every four to six years. Provides for new SDP kit to address obsolescence issues and allow for additional Electronic Protect capability.

Medium Bandwidth Waveform upgrade will address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  This development effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  This effort will provide better target resolution and more accurate tracking in the slant range coordinate.  This improved target resolution and tracking accuracy will provide improved retention of target identification and more robust tracking that addresses the latent tracking issues.  

Sentinel System of Systems: Software Development in support of a system of systems architecture (IAMD and IFPC Inc 2-I) for a required simulation capability. The simulation capability will add a high fidelity representation of Sentinel to IAMD to allow for optimum engagement management and mission planning.  Supports Sentinel Digital Simulation Software (SDS/SENTSIM) development efforts for testing of future capabilities.  Includes software development for Low Slow Small in a test fix test environment as well as integration and testing of the IAMD B kit on board the Sentinel FMTV platform.

Adjunct sensor technology effort will integrate and test a supplemental technology for the Sentinel A3 radar to detect and identify current and emerging threats.  Adjunct sensor technology compliments current radar capabilities to improve system performance and reduces adversaries countermeasure abilities by improving system electronic protect capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Sentinel was procured from Raytheon as a non-developmental item.  Raytheon owns the Technical Data Package (TDP) for the Sentinel A3 and its predecessors and therefore no other contractor has the technical ability to modify the Sentinel radar or Sentinel software.  The modifications planned for the Sentinel that fall into this category are:  Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect, Signal Data Processor/North Finding Module, Medium Bandwidth, and Mode S.  For the Active Electronically Scanned Array, the product office will issue a new contract to develop a modified Sentinel with a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna.
 
Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect (EA/EP) (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to verify the initial EA/EP Database and update the database, software and hardware with more extensive EA/EP signatures to address evolving threats.  The updated database will be tested, documented and released for installation.   

Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) Obsolescence (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to upgrade and mitigate the Signal Data Processor and North Finding Module issues.  The updated SDP and NFM hardware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Medium Bandwidth Waveform (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  The effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  The updated medium bandwidth waveform software and firmware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Mode S (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to address both Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) mode S on board commercial aircraft as well as the M Code Global Positioning System (GPS) capability.  The updated software will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

RSAM (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon to address Sentinel's Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) requirement by updating Sentinel software to accept and respond to the new RSAM messages.  The updated software will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) (Sentinel A4): The Sentinel Product Office will award a new competitive contract to develop an AESA antenna and other associated radar modifications for integration with the existing Sentinel A3 hardware and software.  The CMDS Product Office will support requirement documentation and conduct design analysis to include analysis of technology, decision review preparation, and contract package development for acquisition of the AESA antenna and other radar modifications to upgrade the current Sentinel A3. The software and hardware will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Sentinel System of Systems (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon for risk reduction efforts in the development of the software package to support the identification and engagement of Low Slow Small target sets.  The Sentinel Product Office will work with Other Government Agencies to finalize integration and test of the IAMD B Kit on board the Sentinel platform and to add simulation capability to allow a high fidelity representation of Sentinel to IAMD.

Counter Rocket, Artillery &amp; Mortars (Sentinel A3): The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon for software development to add increased capabilities against the Low Slow Small and Rocket, Artillery &amp; Mortars (RAM) threats. The software will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.

Adjunct Sensor (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will integrate and test a government off the shelf adjunct sensor.  The sensor will be tested, documented and released for installation in the field.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Effective February 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle for Defense Business Systems, applying to the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS).  This DoDI supersedes DoDI 5000.02, improving the alignment of business systems to commercial best practices as well as optimizing efficiencies and effectiveness across DoD for the acquisition of business systems.  Decisions rendered by the Milestone Decision Authority, as outlined in DoDI 5000.75, are referred to as "Authority To Proceed" and replace DoDI 5000.02 "Milestones."</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>GF5 - General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS): GFEBS is the Army's core financial management system for administering its General Fund. Full Deployment was reached in 2012 and the system is currently in sustainment while also conducting capability enhancements to meet policy and user needs. GFEBS follows the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act, The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS subsumed the capabilities, in full or in part, of financial systems operating in excess of 40 years including the Standard Finance System and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions with virtually real time information. On 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed Wave 1 to end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, and several other organizations. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011, and Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012. In addition to providing general sustainment efforts, the program requires RDTE funding to provide system upgrades needed to meet audit readiness, compliance, and SAP standards. Additionally, GFEBS continues to make system changes as requested by the user community through the Process Owners Group; an Senior Executive Service/General Officer-level board that prioritizes user needs; many of these changes require RDT&amp;E funding as determined through a set of established business rules.

EV4 - Project not used. In accordance with DoDI 5000.75 capability enhancements will be performed in the GFEBS baseline (Project GF5).

DV6 - General Fund Enterprise Business System-Sensitive Activities (GFEBS-SA): GFEBS-SA is a designated National Security System (NSS) leveraging the GFEBS base system as the Army's core financial management system certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council. The GFEBS base system has reached Full Deployment and is currently in sustainment; however, the Army still has classified and sensitive financial activity remaining in legacy systems that cannot be processed in the fully-fielded GFEBS system without compromising classified information or missions, or endangering soldiers." . Therefore, GFEBS-SA is an essential financial program designed to enable the auditability that is needed to comply with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), and prevent compromise of data that could cause grave harm to U.S. forces. To protect sensitive information and enable clean auditability, the Army requires a separate instance of GFEBS operated on a secure network for processing sensitive and classified financial transactions. GFEBS-SA will integrate with GFEBS to provide secure, web-based financial execution and reporting capabilities for the Army's classified and sensitive activities. GFEBS-SA is envisioned as a fully functional GFEBS application operated on a secure network (SIPR), leveraging off of the sustained system design while providing additional implementation that includes additional performance requirements designed to protect sensitive intelligence operations and special operations missions. It will process Secret Collateral and below information while providing GFEBS capabilities such as distribution and execution of appropriated funds, cost management, financial reporting, and asset management. GFEBS-SA will be implemented and deployed to 3,000 users across 100 locations worldwide. GFEBS-SA will support information exchanges with organizations that support the Army's sensitive activities mission, including cross-security domain integration between SIPR and NIPR with GFEBS and other system partners. Services will be capable of being upgraded throughout the life of the program in order to incorporate advances in best business practices and technology. The funding requested in FY 2020 supports continued system development in order to allow communication to other systems supporting the auditability of classified financial data, system hosting in the cloud environment, testing, and pre-deployment activities. Overall, the RDT&amp;E funding in FY 2020 supports the transition from development to deployment of the GFEBS-SA effort.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>For FY 2020, the change comes from an increase in RDTE funding to the GFEBS line (GF5). This increase reflects the additional effort focused on completing the audit-related system enhancements which will give the Army an auditable financial system. The GFEBS Process Owners Group and Functional Governance Board have developed a list of enhancement items and have put the highest priority on those items which move the Army closer to realizing a fully auditable system, and the increase in RDTE is to more quickly develop those enhancement items.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

Additionally, funds support efforts to integrate sensitive activity capability across the Enterprise.

Background: Initial implementation of the GFEBS-SA project did not require development funds beyond FY 2016; however, based on a detailed analysis of the original System Integrator, an Army determination was made that they could not deliver a solution to meet the GFEBS-SA requirement. The program was restructured with an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 9 September 2016 in alignment with an Army-validated Operational Needs Statement. A new System Integrator contract began work on 1 May 2017 with a schedule that supports the Army's timeline; minimizing operational risks to the Army's sensitive activity commands.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Testing is the major RDT&amp;E activity in FY 2020 and those activities are performed on government installations with portions of overall program support conducted by personnel at the testing site. Therefore, less direct program support is needed by the program.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

GFEBS-SA OMA requirements are minimal in FY 2020, and will be covered under the base program. Requirements after FY 2020 have been incorporated into the Future Years Defense Program.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Plan, develop, and manage GFEBS-SA as a separate instance from GFEBS base program on the SIPRNet to support delivery of capabilities for this designated National Security System (NSS) in support of the sensitive activity commands. The GFEBS-SA solution will be acquired as a sole source contract with Accenture Federal Services as a single increment. The contract will be a hybrid of Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee CLINs to support development efforts and to encourage Accenture Federal Services to deliver a solution in support of the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army recommendation to accelerate the schedule to ensure operational security and Army audit requirements. The contract was awarded in April 2017.

Software will be developed through a single build to achieve full capability. GFEBS-SA will consist of a single release delivered in a limited deployment (size not capability) to the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) unit, followed by a full deployment to all other users upon successful completion of IOT&amp;E.

The program will require modernization enhancements after full deployment. These modernization enhancements will require a stream of RDT&amp;E funding to keep the GFEBS-SA system synchronized with the base system by making modifications needed for audit readiness, compliancy, and upgrades required to keep the system up-to-date with SAP standards and Functional Governance Board requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) is the Army's core financial management system for administering its General Fund. Full Deployment was reached in 2012 and the system is currently in sustainment while also conducting capability enhancements to meet policy and user needs. It follows the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act, The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS subsumed the capabilities, in full or in part, of financial systems operating in excess of 40 years, including the Standard Finance System and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS is used to administer the Army's General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions with virtually real time information. On 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed Wave 1 to end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, and several other organizations. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011, and Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012. Current efforts include sustaining the system and infrastructure, making modifications needed for audit readiness, compliancy, and upgrades required to maintain the system and meet SAP standards. Additionally, GFEBS continues to make changes as requested by the user community through the Process Owners Group; an Senior Executive Service/General Officer-level board that prioritizes user needs.  Some of these changes require developmental funding and support auditable business environment, financial analytics and enablement of sunsetting of legacy systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Capability enhancements provide changes to the system that are needed to update the infrastructure as required to meet SAP requirements and best practices, and to support evolving statutory and regulatory requirements. The capability enhancement initiatives are needed to increase the GFEBS capability and performance to maintain compliance with Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), Business Enterprise Agency (BEA), Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) requirements, and auditability. These requirements are established and prioritized through a General Officer (GO)/Senior Executive Service (SES)-level Process Owners Group and Functional Governance Board.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds design, development and test of primary target acquisition and counterfire radars to automatically detect, locate and classify hostile indirect fire weapons (mortars, artillery, and rockets).  The program directly supports the prioritization, tracking and locating of targets, and dissemination of that information for simultaneous attack of multiple threats.  It provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counterfire target acquisition systems for all types and phases of military operations. Project L86, Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), version AN/TPQ-50 provides 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers. The AN/TPQ-50 and AN/TPQ-53 radars are currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include operational support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).  Project L88, AN/TPQ-53 is a highly mobile radar system that leverages the latest in technology design to accelerate technology infusion and increase range while improving false location rate, reducing obsolescence and increasing reliability. The AN/TPQ-53 provides a system with increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) for locating mortar, artillery and rocket firing positions.

This program line also funds development of an integrated Hypervelocity Armament System (HAS), and associated technologies as they mature to support accelerated demonstration and transition of advanced gun weapon systems, command guided maneuverable projectiles, and tactical sensors. The development of HAS would include advancing artillery powder guns firing Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVPs), resulting in next-generation, common, low drag, guided cannon artillery projectiles capable of completing multiple missions with improved cost effectiveness across different gun systems. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow closed-loop targeting of moving and relocatable targets beyond the range of conventional artillery. 

The Fiscal Year FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $17.294 million will support ongoing AN/TPQ-53 test efforts and Army interoperability certifications (AICs), AN/TPQ-50 and AN/TPQ-53 development and testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, engineering studies, risk reduction and required documentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/TPQ-50 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) is a highly mobile radar that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar, artillery, and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect. It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers and is capable of being deployed in two configurations, standalone or vehicle mounted. The AN/TPQ-50 system interoperates with mission command systems to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility. The AN/TPQ-50 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems. It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability. The AN/TPQ-50 is currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).

The fiscal year (FY) 2020 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) funds of $4.913 million will continue the work required to enhance the AN/TPQ-50's capability to address electronic protection against cyber electromagnetic activity (CEMA) and other known, new, emerging and evolving threats identified in the Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) report. This funding enables the program to develop and integrate sensor protect capabilities into the software baseline, develop advanced protection techniques which take advantage of hardware upgrades, and develop documentation for hardware and software capability improvements. Funding supports all associated testing costs and program support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The AN/TPQ-50 is currently in full rate production; 400 systems have been procured to complete the program's current AAO requirement. 

Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding supports modernization development task orders under the national maintenance contract (NMC). The efforts extend through the current Program Objective Memorandum (POM) period.

The fiscal year (FY) 2020 RDTE funds of $4.913 million continues the work required to enhance the AN/TPQ-50's capability to address electronic protection against CEMA and other known, new, emerging and evolving threats identified in the VOLT report. This effort develops and integrates sensor protect capabilities into the software baseline, develop advanced protection techniques which take advantage of hardware upgrades, and develops documentation for hardware and software capability improvements. Funding supports all associated testing costs and program support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The development of HAS would include advancing artillery powder guns firing Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVPs), resulting in a next generation, common, low drag, guided cannon artillery projectiles capable of completing multiple missions with improved cost effectiveness. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow closed-loop targeting of moving and relocatable targets beyond the range of conventional artillery.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/TPQ-53 Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar System is a highly mobile radar set that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar, artillery, and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect.  It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) and will replace the current AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder Radars.  The AN/TPQ-53 system interoperates with mission command systems to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN/TPQ-53 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN/TPQ-53 currently supports contingency operations to include Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and is fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Field Artillery Brigades (FABs) and Division Artilleries (DIVARTYs).

The FY 2020 funds of $12.381 million supports ongoing test efforts, continued extended range development and testing, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, engineering studies, risk reduction and required documentation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AN/TPQ-53 leverages technology developed in the multi-mission radar advanced technology objective (ATO) program.  In 2006, the Government awarded a contract following full and open competition for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 radar and the purchase of four non-recurring engineering (NRE) radars.  Twelve additional quick reaction capability (QRC) radars were purchased under the same contract in response to an urgent directed procurement in July 2008.  The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the acquisition of up to 20 more QRC radars.  Twenty systems were procured through two separate contract actions in 2010 and 2011.  A competitive production contract for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems was awarded in 2012 and options for additional systems were awarded in 2013, 2014, and 2015.  Production and delivery of all QRC/Initial Production (IP) systems are complete, and production of LRIP systems is ongoing.  A Full Rate Production (FRP) decision was obtained in December 2015.  The FRP contract to fill the remainder of the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) was awarded in March 2017.  Additionally, all initial production systems will be retrofitted to the FRP configuration.  The AAO was increased from 174 to 189 systems in May 2017; 174 systems have been procured to date.  FRP system deliveries continue through FY 2021.  The system replaces all of the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 systems in the fleet.

RDT&amp;E funding supports modernization development and extended range software development task orders under the existing FRP contract. The efforts extend through the current Program Objective Memorandum (POM) period.

The FY 2020 funds of $12.381 million supports ongoing test efforts, continued extended range development and testing, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, engineering studies, risk reduction and required documentation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element contains five projects:  

Project DX7 - Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS):  TCAPS enables Soldiers to communicate over radios in combat environments while simultaneously providing hearing protection from both steady state and impulse noise.Project

Project EY2 - Integrated Soldier Power Data System - Core:  Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core, Conformal Wearable Battery, Squad Power Manager (SPI) fills the power and energy gaps created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as situational awareness displays, GPS systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices.  

Project EY3 - Soldier Power Generator (SPG) -  fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential and power consuming devices, by providing a single charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. SPG is intended for use in the most austere operating environments providing the Soldier with energy independency for extended mission duration.  The system will provide the Soldier with a lightweight, worn or carried power generation capability, integrated within the warfighters combat load. 

Project EY4 - Universal Battery Charger:  Universal Battery Charger (UBC) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, by providing a sole charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries.  

Project FK4 - Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS):  The SBS is a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The SBS provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver. The system is simple to deploy and use to support the squad leader's decision-making process. The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.  This SBS project is not a new start: funding from this project transferred from PE: 06005053A / Grounds Robotics project 655053.FB8.

S65 - Soldier Power:   Soldier Power enables dismounted Soldiers to efficiently execute missions for longer durations by reducing the logistical burden associated with fuel and primary (disposable) batteries.  Platoon Power Generation (PPG) - PM E2S2: This project supports the demonstration and development of a PPG. The Small Unit Power (SUP) PPG (1kW Generator) will provide small units with sufficient portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8). It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Description:  The Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS) and TCAPS-Lite provide Soldiers with advanced, active hearing protection that simultaneously protects Soldiers' hearing while enabling situational awareness and mission command. TCAPS protects Soldiers against harmful impulse and steady state noises characteristic of combat environments while also enabling Soldiers to communicate with each other using voice communications over a tactical radio, while TCAPS-Lite provides protection for Soldiers without a radio. Both systems enhance survivability and situational awareness by allowing Soldiers to amplify faint sounds that would not be otherwise audible or intelligible. TCAPS and TCAPS-Lite reduces Soldiers noise induced hearing damage and includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.

TCAPS and TCAPS-Lite contribute to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injuries. TCAPS Program of Record will continue to employ commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions that are evaluated periodically. The commercial solutions that meet the technical requirements and are rated the best by the Soldiers will transition to production and fielding.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Integrated Soldier Power Data System - Core (ISPDS-C) funding was realigned from Program Element: 0604827A (Soldier Systems Warrior Dem/Val)/Project: S65 (Soldier Power) starting in FY2018.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier Power Integration (SPI) includes power and data managing/distribution devices, cutting-edge energy storage solutions, and power scavenging devices.  These capabilities fill the power and energy gaps created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as heads up displays, situational awareness displays, GPS systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices. This RDT&amp;E line develops power sources and power management solutions for the individual Soldier and squad for use in the most austere operating environments. SPI systems will enable dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions more efficiently, for longer durations and with fewer battery resupplies while reducing the logistical and physical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries, and allow dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort is consistent with the Soldier Protection Capability Development Document (CDD) (March 2011), Operational Energy Initial Capabilities Document (26 April 2012), the Small Unit Power CDD (26 September 2013), and the draft SPM, ISPDS-C with Conformal Central Power Source Capability Production Document (May 2017).

Justification:  FY20 RDT&amp;E develops and evaluates Intra-Soldier Wireless solutions, fuel cell based solutions and improved mission duration batteries.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Pursue a variety of Soldier power products under full and open competition. Initiatives range from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to developmental efforts. The type of solicitation depends on the maturity of the technology. The power initiatives will be evaluated through scheduled test and evaluation events, and if successful, selected for procurement and subsequent fielding and sustainment. The acquisition strategy varies by product. For example, the CWB acquisition strategy  consists of two phases: Phase one includes the purchase of test articles using the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Special Operational (Spec Ops) Equipment Tailored Logistic Support Program (TLSP) and General Services Administration (GSA) contracts. Phase two includes the procurement of additional test articles through Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts established through the Army Contracting Command (ACC). The Project Manager office will establish IDIQ contracts to support the SPI requirements over time. Each SPI system will be procured under purchase orders for production quantities that will be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  Developmental contracts for intra-soldier wireless technology are awarded through the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY19, funding for Soldier Power Generator was realigned from Program Element: 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem/Val)/Project: S65 (Soldier Power).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier Power Generation (SPG) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential and power consuming devices, by providing charging solutions capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. SPG is intended for use in the most austere operating environments providing the Soldier with energy independency for extended mission duration.  The system will provide the Soldier with a lightweight, worn or carried power generation capability, integrated within the warfighters combat load.

Justification:  Program has no FY20 RDTE funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY18, funding for Universal Battery Charger realigned from Program Element: 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem/Val)/Project S65 (Soldier Power).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Universal Battery Charger (UBC) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential and power consuming devices, by providing a charging solution capable of recharging conformal wearable batteries and a wide variety of handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. The UBC is suited for the company and below formations in the most austere operating environments.  The system can draw power from wall outlets, vehicle power, and solar power sources. The UBC enables dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions with fewer battery resupplies, thus reducing the logistical burden associated with moving fuel, primary (disposable) batteries, and rechargeable batteries. The UBC capability allows dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train.  The UBC can be mounted on wheeled and tracked vehicles. This effort is consistent with the Operational Energy ICD (26 April 2012) and the Universal Battery Charger CPD (27 May 2015).  Full Rate Production decision occurred 17 July 2017.

Justification: FY20 RDTE funding increases UBC capability by increasing battery recharge performance, reducing size and also tests and evaluates the increased UBC capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project FK4 - Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS):  The SBS is a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The SBS provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver. The system is simple to deploy and use to support the squad leader's decision-making process. The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier and Small Unit Power (SUP) enables dismounted Soldiers to efficiently execute missions for longer durations by reducing the logistical burden associated with fuel and primary (disposable) batteries. Power solutions address energy deficits resulting from increased power demands associated with providing the Soldier with increased situational awareness displays, Global Positioning System (GPS) systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices. The Soldier and Small Unit Power system develops and tests power sources and solutions suited for the individual Soldier, team, squad, and platoon in the most austere operating environments.  Develops and evaluates additional sources of power such as individual Soldier worn systems, renewable energy, and kinetic energy harvesting technologies. This effort is consistent with the Sep 2013 Small Unit Power CDD, the Dec 2011 Operational Energy ICD, and the Mar 2011 Soldier Protection CDD, and the Universal Battery Charger CPD (May 2015).

Platoon Power Generation - PM E2S2: This project supports the demonstration and development of a Platoon Power Generation (PPG).  The Small Unit Power PPG will provide small units with no less than 900 Watts of portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8).  It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices.  It will provide sufficient power to recharge and power all Platoon equipment and fulfill residual power gaps at the Squad and Soldier level.  The generator will provide Platoon power for charging batteries when away from vehicles in all Brigade Combat Teams (Stryker, Armor and Infantry), Rangers and Special Forces in austere environments.  FY 2020 funds will be used to complete the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.

Funding supports modernization of the current power generation for Soldier borne sensors by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to a modified COTS generator concept and proprietary fuel atomization. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational energy concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Utilizing Other Transactional Agreement (OTA) contract vehicle culminating in an EMD award of three (3) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts supporting an 18-24 month Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  Three selected contractors have been awarded EMD contracts and will separately fabricate and produce the minimum order of 15 Small Unit Power Platoon Power Generation (>900 Watts) systems (5 per vendor).  The selected vendors will produce 5 additional systems to undergo developmental test (DT), a logistics demonstration (LD), pre-production qualification test, and limited user / operational test (LUT/OT). Upon successful completion of these tests and completion of logistics supportability, the performance data and Soldier's feedback will be utilized in preparation for Milestone C (MS C) 3rd Qtr FY20.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

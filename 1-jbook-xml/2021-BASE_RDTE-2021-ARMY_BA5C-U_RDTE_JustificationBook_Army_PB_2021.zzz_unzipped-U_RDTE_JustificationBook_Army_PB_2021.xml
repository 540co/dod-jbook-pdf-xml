            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element contains five projects:  

Project DX7 - Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS):  TCAPS enables Soldiers to communicate over radios in combat environments while simultaneously providing hearing protection from both steady state and impulse noise.

Project EY2 - Integrated Soldier Power Data System - Core:  Integrated Soldier Power and Data Hub, Conformal Wearable Battery, Squad Power Manager (SPM) fills the power and energy gaps created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as situational awareness displays, GPS systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices.  

Project EY3 - Soldier Power Generator (SPG) -  fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential and power consuming devices, by providing a single charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. SPG is intended for use in the most austere operating environments providing the Soldier with energy independency for extended mission duration.  The system will provide the Soldier with a lightweight, worn or carried power generation capability, integrated within the warfighters combat load. 

Project EY4 - Universal Battery Charger:  Universal Battery Charger (UBC) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, by providing a family of charging solutions capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries.  

Project FK4 - Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS):  The SBS is a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The SBS provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver. The system is simple to deploy and use to support the squad leader's decision-making process. The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.  The SBS will be procured in multiple Tranches/increments.  RDTE funding will be used to develop, integrate, and qualify additional capabilities for each tranche.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.  This SBS project is not a new start: funding from this project transferred from PE: 06005053A / Grounds Robotics project 655053.FB8.

S65 - Soldier Power:   Soldier Power enables dismounted Soldiers to efficiently execute missions for longer durations by reducing the logistical burden associated with fuel and primary (disposable) batteries.  Platoon Power Generation (PPG) - PM E2S2: This project supports the demonstration and development of a PPG. The Small Unit Power (SUP) PPG (1kW Generator) will provide small units with sufficient portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8). It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Description:  The Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS) and TCAPS-Lite provide Soldiers with advanced, active hearing protection that simultaneously protects Soldiers' hearing while enabling situational awareness and mission command. TCAPS protects Soldiers against harmful impulse and steady state noises experienced in combat environments while also enabling Soldiers to communicate with each other using voice communications over a tactical radio, while TCAPS-Lite provides protection for Soldiers without a radio. Both systems enhance survivability and situational awareness by allowing Soldiers to amplify faint sounds that would not otherwise be audible. TCAPS and TCAPS-Lite reduces Soldiers noise induced hearing damage and includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.

TCAPS and TCAPS-Lite contribute to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injuries. TCAPS Program of Record will continue to employ commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions that are evaluated periodically. The commercial solutions that meet the technical requirements and are rated the best by the Soldiers will transition to production and fielding.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>ISPDS-C includes power and data managing/distribution devices, cutting-edge energy storage solutions, and power scavenging devices. These capabilities fill the power and energy gaps created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as heads up displays, situational awareness displays, GPS systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices. This RDT&amp;E line develops power sources and power management solutions for the individual Soldier and squad for use in all operating environments. ISPDS-C systems will enable dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions more efficiently, for longer durations and with fewer battery resupplies while reducing the logistical and physical burden associated with moving fuel and batteries, and allow dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions.

Justification:  FY21 RDT&amp;E develops and evaluates low power Intra-Soldier wireless solutions, fuel cell based solutions and improved batteries.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Pursue a variety of Soldier power products under full and open competition. Initiatives range from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to developmental efforts. The type of solicitation depends on the maturity of the technology. The power initiatives will be evaluated through scheduled test and evaluation events, and if successful, selected for procurement and subsequent fielding and sustainment. The acquisition strategy varies by product. For example, the CWB acquisition strategy consists of two phases: Phase one includes the purchase of test articles using the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Special Operational (Spec Ops) Equipment Tailored Logistic Support Program (TLSP) and General Services Administration (GSA) contracts. Phase two establishes an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract through the Army Contracting Command (ACC) which qualifies a minimum of two vendors to take into production. The Project Manager office will establish IDIQ contracts to support the ISPDS-C requirements over time. Each ISPDS-C system will be procured under purchase orders for production quantities that will be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier Power Generation (SPG) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential and power consuming devices, by providing charging solutions capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. SPG is intended for use in the most austere operating environments providing the Soldier with energy independency for extended mission duration.  The system will provide the Soldier with a lightweight, worn or carried power generation capability, integrated within the warfighters combat load.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Universal Battery Charger: Universal Battery Charger (UBC) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, by providing a family of charging solutions capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and military batteries to support mounted and dismounted formations.  The UBC is suited for mounted and dismounted operations at the company level and below in multi-domain and austere operating environments. The system can draw power from wall outlets, vehicle power, and solar power sources. The UBC enables dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions with fewer battery resupplies, thus reducing the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and batteries. The UBC capability allows dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions. The UBC also fills the power and energy gap associated with bulk charging. Develop and integrate vehicular on-the-move charging systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project FK4 - Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS):  The SBS is a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The SBS provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver. The system is simple to deploy and use to support the squad leader's decision-making process. The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.  The SBS will be procured in multiple tranches/increments. RDTE funding will be used to develop, integrate, and qualify additional capabilities for each tranche.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier and Small Unit Power (SUP) enables dismounted Soldiers to efficiently execute missions for longer durations by reducing the logistical burden associated with fuel and primary (disposable) batteries. Power solutions address energy deficits resulting from increased power demands associated with providing the Soldier with increased situational awareness displays, Global Positioning System (GPS) systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices. The Soldier and Small Unit Power system develops and tests power sources and solutions suited for the individual Soldier, team, squad, and platoon in the most austere operating environments.  Develops and evaluates additional sources of power such as individual Soldier worn systems, renewable energy, and kinetic energy harvesting technologies. This effort is consistent with the Sep 2013 Small Unit Power CDD, the Dec 2011 Operational Energy ICD, and the Mar 2011 Soldier Protection CDD, and the Universal Battery Charger CPD (May 2015).

Platoon Power Generation - PM E2S2: This project supports the demonstration and development of a Platoon Power Generation (PPG).  The Small Unit Power PPG will provide small units with no less than 900 Watts of portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8).  It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices.  It will provide sufficient power to recharge and power all Platoon equipment and fulfill residual power gaps at the Squad and Soldier level.  The generator will provide Platoon power for charging batteries when away from vehicles in all Brigade Combat Teams (Stryker, Armor and Infantry), Rangers and Special Forces in austere environments.  FY 2020 funds will be used to complete the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.

Funding supports modernization of the current power generation for Soldier borne sensors by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to a modified COTS generator concept and proprietary fuel atomization. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational energy concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>There is no funding request for Program Element (PE) 0604852A Suite of Survivability Enhancement Systems - EMD Project XU9 Active Protection System in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Current ground combat vehicle platforms and tactical wheeled vehicles within Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) lack the ability to effectively detect, track, divert, disrupt, neutralize, or destroy incoming direct or indirect fired threat munitions.  Current solutions to defeat these threats, Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Slat armor, do not provide preemptive or active protection and impose secondary blast hazards to crew, dismounted soldiers, and adjacent vehicles and equipment.  The Suite of Vehicle Protection Systems - EMD PE 0604852A will develop and mature solutions to increase the protection of the Army's ground systems from both current and next generation direct or indirect fired threat munitions.  

The Active Protection System will install and characterize Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Active Protection Systems on Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker demonstrator vehicles.  The Active Protection System effort will assess the maturity, performance, and integration risk of NDI Active Protection Systems, develop and refine Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker Active Protection System installation kit designs, and build prototypes necessary to conduct performance and safety testing to obtain an Active Protection System Urgent Materiel Release (UMR).  Active Protection System effort will execute installation design refinement and required testing to meet urgent fielding of NDI APS on Abrams, Bradley and Stryker pending Army leadership approval. The Active Protection System NDI effort served to inform the Vehicle Protection Suite Trade Study.

The Vehicle Protection Suite (VPS) Project (FE8) will design, mature, and evaluate combinations of active, reactive, and passive solutions and leverage both Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) principles and the Army's Modular Active protection system Controller (MAC) to develop tailored vehicle Survivability Sets that will mitigate existing protection gaps, allow for future technology insertion to meet evolving threats, and minimize the impact to the current capabilities hosted on Army ground system platforms.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In FY 2018, the VPS program initiated characterization of the MAC compliant/NDI capabilities (hardware, software, interfaces, etc.) to inform the VPS Trade Study.  The MAC compliant/NDI capabilities characterization efforts will be achieved through bailments, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), and Other Transactional Agreements (OTA) with industry partners.  The VPS Trade Study will assess the cost, maturity, complexity, performance, and physical properties of alternative survivability sets to determine the optimal application of VPS solutions onto the Army's ground combat platforms.  The VPS Tranche II solutions (soft and hard kill integration with MAC, threat detection, passive and active signature management, active blast defeat, and other protection technologies) based on the results of the Trade Study will have a decision point and program initiation in FY 2020.  Along with the Tranche II activities starting in FY 2020, the VPS program will initiate MAC with LWR integration onto ground combat vehicle platforms, logistics product development, and software development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Active Protection System Project XU9 is a continuation of efforts previously executed under PE 0203735A - Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs.

The APS installation and characterization effort will evaluate platform (Abrams, Bradley, Stryker) performance with an NDI APS solution installed.  Platform performance evaluation includes APS sensor assessments, minimum live threat characterization, surface danger zone characterization, co-site mitigation (antennas/radiators), electromagnetic interference assessment/characterization, energetic radiation assessment, and a durability assessment.  The NDI APS installation and characterization is being executed through a partnership between the US Army, NDI APS solution vendors, and prime contractors for Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker vehicles.  NDI APS vendor support, to include procurement of demonstration hardware, is contracted on a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) basis, while platform prime contractor technical support is provided on a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis.  The results from the installation and characterization effort has resulted in moving forward with installation design refinement and required testing to meet urgent fielding of NDI APS on Abrams and Bradley.  Characterization of APS solutions for Stryker revealed that while they were capable of intercepting threats, no solutions were suitable for Stryker.  Continued limited characterizations of APS solutions are planned to better understand their functionality, generate performance data, and determine if future integration onto a Stryker platform is feasible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project 509 LIGHTWEIGHT 155M HOWITZER funding decrease from Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 to FY 2021 is the result of the completion of the operational demonstration of the M777 Extended Range Howitzer.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for artillery weapons systems.  

Project 509 supports the Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, which is a Joint Service program between the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and US Army which provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. The LW155 was first introduced into the USMC in April 2005 and the Marines have fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades, National Guard and Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT). The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 30 kilometers (km) and assisted projectiles to 40km.  It is a successful joint service program between the USMC and US Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer.  The howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system, since it has been in the field for more than ten years.   

Current development efforts are focused on extending the range of the LW155 to reduce the threat of being out ranged by potential adversaries and meeting the range key performance parameter objective distance (greater than 40km) as stated in the Joint US Army, USMC Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for Advanced Towed Cannon System, but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity, cost and schedule.  The USMC and US Army are leveraging technology being developed as part of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program by the US Army.  The ERCA program is a suite of technologies, cannon, ammunition and fire control, to increase the range of cannon artillery to exceed peer competitors range (greater than 70km).  An operational demonstration of the M777 Extended Range (M777ER) howitzer will be conducted at the end of FY 2020 to assess the performance of best available projectiles and objective hardware of M777ER howitzer.

Project HB6 supports the mobile howitzer program.  The Mobile 155mm Howitzer is a Self-Propelled, 155mm Wheeled Howitzer that provides lethal, proactive counter-fire essential for the survivability of the maneuver formations and other close support fires as required.  The Mobile Howitzer improves the Field Artillery Battalion's ability to maintain pace with its supporting maneuver formations and survive against responsive, counter-fire from near-peer threats with rapid displacement and emplacement times.  The mobile howitzer will improve tactical mobility and system survivability compared to existing towed howitzer systems.  Development efforts, prototyping and evaluations will focus on attributes such as improved emplacement and displacement times, driving speed, and crew protection capabilities, all without sacrificing lethality versus existing towed howitzer systems.  Program activities in FY 2021 will be focused on using Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to evaluate vendor mobile howitzer systems against system requirements. Evaluation will include safety testing, US ammunition compatibility testing, and assessment of mobility, survivability and transportability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lightweight 155 millimeter (mm) Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, is a Joint Service program between the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and United States Army which provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. The LW155 was first introduced into the USMC in April 2005 and the Marines have fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades, National Guard and Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT). The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan, receiving high marks for its performance.  It replaces all howitzers in all USMC missions and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 30 kilometers (km) and assisted projectiles to 40km. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 40km with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms.  It is a successful joint service program between the USMC and United States Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer.  The howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system, since it has been in the field for more than ten years.   

Production and fielding of the LW155 concluded and entered into the Sustainment Life Cycle Phase.  Current development efforts are focused on extending the range of the LW155 to reduce the threat of being out ranged by potential adversaries and meeting the range key performance parameter objective distance (greater than 40km) as stated in the Joint United States Army, USMC Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for Advanced Towed Cannon System, but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity, cost and schedule.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project HB6 supports the mobile howitzer program.  The Mobile 155 millimeter (mm) Howitzer is a Self-Propelled, 155mm Wheeled Howitzer that provides lethal, proactive counter-fire essential for the survivability of the maneuver formations and other close support fires as required.  The Mobile Howitzer improves the Field Artillery Battalion's ability to maintain pace with its supporting maneuver formations and survive against responsive, counter-fire from near-peer threats with rapid displacement and emplacement times.  The mobile howitzer will improve tactical mobility and system survivability compared to existing towed howitzer systems.  Development efforts, prototyping and evaluations will focus on attributes such as improved emplacement and displacement times, driving speed, and crew protection capabilities, all without sacrificing lethality versus existing and future towed howitzer systems.   Program activities in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 will be focused on evaluation of vendor mobile howitzer systems against system requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Human Resource System (099) contains the following programs: Go Army Education managed by the Human Resource Command, Commanders Risk Reduction Dashboard managed by Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) and Regional Level Applications Software (RLAS) managed by United States Army Reserves (USAR).

In support of recruiting and retention for a more educated workforce, GoArmyEd is the virtual financial management portal and decision-support tool for 1) AD, USAR and ARNG Soldiers to request Tuition Assistance (TA); 2) Cadets to request Scholarship payments and 3) Department of the Army (DA) Civilians and Apprentices to request professional development funds. GoArmyEd is an enterprise system that enforces eligibility for higher education funds and creates efficiencies with its automated processes.  Soldiers, Scholarship Cadets, DA Civilians and Apprentices use it to pursue post-secondary educational goals and professional development objectives; Army Education Counselors use it to provide educational guidance; Career Program Managers and Training Managers use it to manage civilian training; and Academic Institutions use it to deliver degree and course offerings and to report user progress and degree completions for 206K Soldiers, Cadets and Civilians.

Commanders Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD) began with the identification of capability gaps arising out of the 2010 Red Book and 2012 Gold Book, two extensive studies directed by senior army leadership to examine suicide prevention (Red Book) and the Army's health and discipline (Gold Book). The studies illustrated that Commanders faced capability gaps in their ability to identify high risk behavior and risk factors, analyze soldier and unit risk, and identify risk trends and develop intervention strategies. CRRD provides Commanders at echelons Company through Major Army Command the ability to visualize and take preventive action to mitigate risk factors impacting their soldiers and formations by going to one dashboard and seeing data from multiple data sources.  CRRD has additional enhancements projected for the programmed $621K to improve the Increment (INC) II capability release. 

The United States Army Reserve (USAR) utilizes the Regional Level Application Software (RLAS) as an enterprise system for duty attendance, military pay, Soldier records management and training calendar management to access, transact, store and manage Soldier and unit data required to conduct synchronized USAR operations. Unlike the Army Active Component (AC) where Soldier military pay is centrally managed and input at the installation level, the USAR utilizes RLAS to manage and input decentralized Soldier pay transactions at the unit level. RLAS consists of four modules: Pay, Personnel, Training, and Resource Management. Research and Development (R&amp;D) authority and funding will provide RLAS with investment funds for necessary system development and system modifications. R&amp;D funding amounts increase slightly towards the end of RLAS lifecycle (FY 2019 and 2020) in order to fully support the Integrated Pay and Personnel System - Army (IPPS-A) transition.  Annually, USAR will provide sustainment funding.  R&amp;D authority and sustainment funding will meet the  USAR Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and Office of the Secretary of Defense Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) opinions regarding defense information Technology (IT) system for R&amp;D activities. Necessary RLAS system development and system modifications include: 1) IPPS-A interface requirements; 2) implementing Microsoft .net Framework 4.5 standards; 3) implementing new Operating Systems (OS), system utilities and other technology products. Enhanced development and modification to RLAS will improve RLAS system capabilities and bring RLAS into compliance with various Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and audit readiness requirements. RLAS will continue to process duty attendance, military pay, Soldier personnel transactions and training calendars until the system is fully subsumed by IPPS-A.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The dashboard will provide Commanders in all Army components with the capability to obtain information regarding the soldier?s previous disciplinary actions, both civilian and UCMJ as well as the information regarding the health of the Soldier.  This information will enable the Commander to gain additional inputs on the Soldier?s background, allowing the Commander to adjust their leadership and counseling approach to improve the Soldier?s wellbeing therefore increasing their ability to perform their duties.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The United States Army Reserve (USAR) utilizes the Regional Level Application Software (RLAS) as an enterprise system for duty attendance, military pay, Soldier records management and training calendar management to access, transact, store and manage Soldier and unit data required to conduct synchronized USAR operations. Unlike the Army Active Component (AC) where Soldier military pay is centrally managed and input at the installation level, the USAR utilizes RLAS to manage and input decentralized Soldier pay transactions at the unit level. RLAS consists of four modules: Pay, Personnel, Training, and Resource Management.  R&amp;D authority and funding will meet the USAR Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and Office of the Secretary of Defense Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) opinions regarding defense information Technology (IT) system for R&amp;D activities. Necessary RLAS system development and system modifications include: 1) Integrated Pay and Personnel System ? Army (IPPS-A) interface requirements; 2) implementing Microsoft .net Framework 4.5 standards; 3) implementing new Operating Systems (OS), system utilities and other technology products. Enhanced development and modification will improve RLAS system capabilities and bring RLAS into compliance with various Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and audit readiness requirements.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GoArmyEd - The program manager makes extensive use of Integrated Product Teams (IPTs).  Sub-elements of the acquisition (engineering and design, logistics planning, testing, etc.) are intensively managed by integrated teams of government and contractor personnel.  Task performance is tracked against the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resources allocated to each task are adjusted based on performance against the WBS.  GoArmyEd contractual efforts are acquired on a firm fixed price basis on existing contractual vehicles.

CRRD - CRRD uses an incremental acquisition approach and leverages user experience experiments (UXEs) for user inputs to allow for rapid development, maximum adoption, continuous product improvements, and technical innovation. The iterative development methodology will enable expedited deployment of the capability to the field while maintaining Acquisition control through Limited Deployment Authorities to Proceed and a competitively awarded sustainment contract. 

RLAS - Will utilize GSA contract support to solicit FY 2020/2021 two-year software support &amp; development contract - hybrid Firm Fixed Price &amp; Time and Materials. RLAS will utilize GSA contract support to solicit FY 2021/2022/2023 three-year software support &amp; development contract - hybrid Firm Fixed Price &amp; Time and materials.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Installation Support Modules (ISM) consists of four standardized, web based, custom-developed enterprise wide applications that integrate essential installation business practices and processes throughout the Army, to meet Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) Brigade Combat Team readiness and deployment requirements. Three modules support human resources business functions (In/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over $9 billion combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory. The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. 
  
Coalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 2005.  

Army Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicide attempts are collected and stored in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement. ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.

ISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Funding supports research and development to comply with Department of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.0 million.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) System interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The MC4 System fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed Service members' medical treatment to include its associated medical surveillance.  The MC4 System supports other Soldier protection initiatives by providing data for analyses which can be used for identification and development of critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing, integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Effort has also been initiated to integrate MC4 with the Army Chief Information Office (CIO) Network 2020 and Common Operating Environment (COE) and as a program of record in the Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment Working Group.  Funding provides engineering, developmental testing, and integration of information management/information technology to support Force Health Protection in accordance with the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MC4 Program supports a number of Army Medical Information Technology/Communications initiatives. The near and mid-term focus of the MC4 program is to engineer, design, integrate, test, acquire and field the Army automation infrastructure capabilities supporting fielding of the Defense Healthcare Management Systems Electronic Health Record integrated software application suite, future modernized capability, and other Army requirements. The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components. Since Electronic Health Record software is a major component of the MC4 System and being developed in increments by the Joint Program, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and planned upgrades. The MC4 Program works with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities. These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date. This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and planned upgrades. This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities, and forward into the future with a fully modernized system. Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, cloud computing capability environment, etc.) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available. Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and planned upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Accessions Information Environment (AIE): supports the Army's Accessions Enterprise (AE). AIE aligns authorities, responsibilities, and resources, for Total Army accessions. It provides the Army's strength through its four missions: (1) Enlist Soldiers, (2) Commission Officers, (3) Fulfill In-Service requirements, and (4) Support and sustain. AIE will replace 11 legacy systems with 33 modules of the current legacy Accessions IT systems which have experienced frequent outages and unstable performance, directly impairing the Army's ability to make its recruiting mission. Successful implementation is of utmost priority for the enterprise. AIE is  a COTS-based information technology (IT) software system  that will modernize the AE. It will be a fully integrated Army-wide enterprise level software system for the accessions workforce to acquire the best-qualified warfighting talent (officer/enlisted/internal recruiting requirements) to meet Army recruiting and accessions requirements. Key AIE functions / core capabilities include: lead generation &amp; management, prospecting, interviewing, processing, pay &amp; incentives, intelligence, marketing, training / leader development. This effort will ultimately ensure the accessions workforce has the information needed to engender commitments, lead future Soldiers, and engage communities in direct contact with young Americans. In FY 2021, AIE will continue prototyping efforts, adding required capabilities to deployed functionality. AIE prototyping started in FY 2019, continued in FY 2020, and will continue to execute within the DoD 5000.75 Acquisition, Testing and Deployment phase. The prototype will be matured to increase functionality to be deployed based on the planned iterative Capability Waves. The FY 2021 funding will continue to support iterative Wave requirements analysis, business process reengineering, design, capability configuration, interface development, capability integration, cybersecurity engineering (to include Risk Management Framework continuous monitoring), systems engineering, software licenses for configuration and early adopter user environment, System Test &amp; Evaluation, and Cloud Hosting (applications and data storage) to expand the prototype solution to an additional 6,466+ recruiters while preparing deployment and training to an additional 15,611+ recruiters.

HRC Accessioning IT: Additionally, this program supports the development requirements for the US Army Human Resources Command (USAHRC) which provides the IT solutions and automation support necessary to accomplish the Army's Accessioning mission. 

Army Suicide Prevention: This Program Element (PE) develops a pre-entry or entry assessment package that enhances the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development). This PE enhances the Army's ability to identify individuals with a higher likelihood of having already experienced, or of potentially experiencing, sub- clinical behavioral issues, as well as to identify character strengths (e.g., resilience, grit), to ensure that the Army can meet mission requirements in the current and future operating environments.

Wave 2: (FY2020) Provides additional capability (Pay &amp; Incentives and Intelligence) to an additional 1942 users at 15 additional locations

Wave 3: (FY2021) Provides additional capability (Marketing) to an additional 6466 users at 35 additional locations

Wave 4: (FY2021) Provides additional capability (Training/Leader Development) to an additional 8238 users at 43 additional locations

Wave 5: (FY2022) Provides full capability to all remaining users (7373) at all remaining locations (47)

At the completion of each Wave, new capabilities will be made available to all previously fielded users through the use of Delta training packages sent to the commands.  At the conclusion of all Waves, AIE will deliver the Lead Generation &amp; Management, Prospecting, Interviewing, Processing, Pay &amp; Incentives, Intelligence, Marketing, and Training /Leader Development capabilities to support the Army's Accessions mission. Capabilities will be delivered using an agile methodology.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

SOLDIER FOR LIFE - TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM XXI (SFL-TAP XXI): The Transition Assistance Program XXI (TAP-XXI) application provides an interactive, multimedia approach to pre-separation counseling and job assistance training. This application uses full motion video, graphics, and sound to train clients; and schedules clients for classroom-type instruction. It integrates a complete range of transition services and benefits for service members, Department of Defense civilian employees, and their family members as they transition from the military. TAP-XXI is a web-based, three-tiered application with a centralized database for all Transition sites. The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers.  The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers. The application also allows for access outside of Transition centers to support mobilizing and de-mobilizing during Yellow Ribbon Program events or delivery of services at home station.  There is no application processing on the desktops located at Transition Centers. TAP-XXI application suite consists of the following subsystems: Transition Assistance Program - Support (TAP-Support), Transition Assistance Program -Online (TAP-Online) and TAP Virtual (Immersive Terf). The infrastructure modernization will provide system stability, support expansion requirements, and ensure reliable customer support.

Human Resource Command (HRC) Core IT: This program supports efforts to plan, design, develop, and test Information Technology (IT) solutions to fulfill the Army's Warfighter Support Mission, accommodate emerging Army requirements, and fulfill Future Army needs.  Ongoing development efforts support multiple functional areas including logistics, personnel, transportation, training, medical/health protection, and the sustaining base.  The focus of the rationalization effort is to identify value-added applications capable of serving a broader Army enterprise audience and garnering efficiencies through the elimination of outdated, legacy, and duplicative applications.  Applications are upgraded or enhanced to meet compliance with Army Common Operating Environment standards in accordance with Army Application Management Business Office (AAMBO). Additionally, program supports enhancements and modifications to the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS) and iPERMS-Secure (iPERMS-S), as well as development of interfaces based upon emerging requirements, Cybersecurity, functionality and compliance with Army standards.

R-Builder is a living application database system that allows the Manning Program Evaluation Group (MM PEG) to update the database to include various cost drivers and factors used for programming, budgeting for all Army Service members pay, allowances, and benefits for the all-volunteer Army. R-Builder is used to develop the annual Program Objective Memorandum -Budget Estimate Submission (POM-BES), and to develop and manage the Army's military and civilian personnel in order to execute the President's National Security Strategy.

The Army Review Board Agency (ARBA) operates under the delegated authority of the Secretary of the Army as the final level of appeal for service members in uniform, veterans, and their family members, adjudicating tens of thousands of claimed errors or injustices annually. ARBA is staffed with 128 military personnel, civilians, and contractors, and additional 350 external Advisors and Boards Members. ARBA struggles with the substantial process and system-related inefficiencies. The Agency currently uses the ARBA Case Tracking System (ACTS) to facilitate case adjudication and the routing of corresponding hard copy case files (a.k.a. "redwelds"). This system was custom built in 1999, strictly for tracking the hand offs of redwelds. At its inception, ACTS was a huge leap forward; however, as the organization and technology evolved, the system has not been able to meet new Agency mission objectives and streamlining initiatives. This antiquated system costs the Agency multi-millions in annual sustainment fees and lacks the agility to address changing business requirements and organizational roles.

Army SHARP Data Management System (DMS) Integrated Case Reporting System (ICRS) enhancements will provide stabilization for sexual harassment (SH) data collection, reporting requirements, and analytic processes; ICRS maintains Army sexual assault (SA) legacy data collected prior to 2014 in the Sexual Assault Data Management System (SADMS) IAW public law.

ARIMS is the Army's policy and enterprise system deployed to meet statutory (36 CFR) and regulatory (AR 25-1, AR 25-400-2) requirements to manage records that document the policies, decisions, and actions of the Army both as a military department and federal institution. ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY 2018) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army's classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army's records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations.  Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems. These skill sets are not maintained by government staff and must, by DoD directive (C3I), be acquired from the private sector.

Family Advocacy System of Records (FASOR) is the information system used by the Army to manage child and adult based abuse incidents referred by the Family Advocacy Program (FAP).  FASOR  is used to capture/perform  incident case management and allows for standardization of reviews and incident determinations. FASOR  is a key system used in FAP Army Central Registry (ACR) background checks when determining suitability of individuals to be placed into "positions of trust".  Finally, FASOR facilitates reporting and data analysis in support of internal, Army, DoD, FOIA and Congressional requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2020 funding is to modernize and re-engineer the current ARBA Case Tracking System (ACTS) that is in sustainment. ARBA?s leadership has aggressively driven business process reengineering to include end-to-end case digitization. However, ACTS? inflexibility stands in the way of Agency progress on many fronts and negatively affects the timeliness, costs, and quality of ARBA?s work products. Additionally, ARBA has undergone increasing congressional scrutiny, unfavorable media conclusions, and publicized court remands surrounding the quality and timeliness of its 18,000 annual adjudication outcomes. As a result, ARBA leadership has committed to Congress that it will drive fundamental change across the DOTMLPF-P spectrum.

In summary, these significant problems result in greatly extended processing times, bottle-necked and rushed adjudication activities, numerous redundant hand-offs, and at times incorrect or contestable board outcomes. ARBA?s current process requires labor-intensive hard copy printing, collating, transporting, filing, scanning, labeling, inventorying, shipping, shredding, mailing, and tracking of redwelds and their content.
- ARBA ADS Modernization capability requirements can be summarized as follows: 
- Lifecycle Case Management ? End-to-end Structured Process
- Complete Case Digitization (electronic cases, board scheduling/voting, approvals, signatures)
- Improved External Stakeholder Exchange and Case Transit
- Leverage Historical Information/Comprehensive Knowledge Management Capability

                                <r2:Title>ARIMS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>ARIMS is the Army?s policy and enterprise system deployed to meet statutory (36 CFR) and regulatory (AR 25-1, AR 25-400-2) requirements to manage records that document the policies, decisions, and actions of the Army both as a military department and federal institution. ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY 2018) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army?s classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army?s records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations.  Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems. These skill sets are not maintained by government staff and must, by DoD directive (C3I), be acquired from the private sector.

This funds contractor man-years for technical and analytical expertise in the integration and validation of operational databases used to store and research combat records from combat operations in Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, Panama, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other contingency operations. The effort supports over 30 distinct and unique operational databases that directly support research into Veteran claims for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Agent Orange, and other medical conditions developed by Soldiers during combat and non-combat operations. Supports the Army?s Data Center Consolidation by turning data base structure to be more efficient and reduce maintenance support costs.

Increased Congressional inquiries and litigation have raised leadership awareness of the need to improve records management compliance Army-wide. SecArmy directed workgroup, led by the AASA, with participation by the CIO/G-6, NETCOM, OGC, and OCLL is to provide a comprehensive solution for the Army and integrate and standardize management systems for the Army?s business operations. Enhancing and modernizing of existing ARIMS functionality and capability to support the SecArmy initiative includes updating ARIMS to support current technology such as Microsoft SharePoint environment, expanding storage capability, including network storage , and commensurate expansion of backup, security and communications capabilities over CONUS and OCONUS networks.  This effort supports the ADCCP program.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds information technology systems that support Army Training.  The five systems under FM8 are described below. Of those, the Army Training Information System (ATIS) is the Army's priority and the focus of the major investment in FM8.  ATIS directly supports two of the four Army Unit Readiness Priorities - Training and Leader Development and an enabler for the Manning and Equipping.

1.  Army Training Information System (ATIS).  The Army currently lacks an enterprise level Common Operational Picture (COP) of the training environment.  The ATIS is designated a Defense Business System (DBS) that will develop, integrate, test, deliver, operate, and maintain an enterprise capability for the Army training and education communities. Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats. Annual costs to maintain current legacy systems is ~$75M. Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of training information systems that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting efficient use of training resources, (people, time, money, material) that directly impacts the ability for units to meet readiness objectives.

ATIS will replace the functionality in 28 primary and 70 supporting information training systems with a single, integrated, user-friendly and technologically current system that will support management of the following training functions for 1.8M users:  

-  Training Development.  Provides ability to develop and coordinate information, including training packages, training events, courses, and exercises.
-  Training Management.  Provides centralized ability to access and manage information, including individual and collective/unit training that supports mission tasks and individual training records.
-  Enterprise Scheduling.  Provides a single integrated set of applications to schedule training resources, including transportation, classrooms, ranges, supplies, and mandated legal/social individual and unit training.
-  Content Management.  Provides centralized access to training information anytime, anywhere, including educational and professional instruction.
-  Resource Management.  Provides ability to manage availability/sustainability of training enablers and resources. 

ATIS is a Category II Defense Business System and will follow the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) in accordance with DoD 5000.75.  ATIS Acquisition, Testing and Development phase will be executed as a single-vendor logical follow-on to the competitively awarded prototyping effort under Other Transaction Authority (OTA), as specifically authorized by 10 U.S.C Section 2371b, in accordance with the Acquisition Strategy. OTA is a streamlined method for transitioning successful prototype projects into follow-on production.  Contract award scheduled for FY20, Q2.  

Following are the Release capabilities:  

-  First Release (R1) - Operational, Training and Readiness Support.  R1 shall provide, as a minimum, Training Management capability with elements from Training Development, Enterprise Scheduling with readiness reporting capability.  Training Management includes access to individual and collective/unit training records aligned to mission tasks.  The Training Development encompasses assembling training information to include training plans, training events, courses, and exercises.  The Enterprise Scheduling enables users to schedule training classrooms or ranges for unit training.  The authorized released system shall be scaled to support, as a minimum, 500 sustained, concurrent users.  The Release shall ensure coverage of organizations across the spectrum of all six Warfighting Functions (Intelligence, Movement and Maneuver, Fire Support, Command and Control, Protection and Sustainment).  The Release shall support users that are geographically dispersed.  
-  Second Release (R2) - Operational Force Support.  R2 shall provide, as a minimum, three capabilities in support of the Operational Force:  Training Management, Enterprise Scheduling, and Resource Management.  The Release shall support the expanded capabilities over a larger, more diverse and geographically dispersed section of the force with focus on FORSCOM and Brigades.  The Release shall support 12,000 sustained, concurrent users.  The Release shall support 1.02M unique active users annually.
-  Third Release (R3) - Full Capability Support.  The final release shall deliver the remaining ATIS capability:  Training Development and Learning Content Management, as well as completion of remaining requirements across all five capability areas.  The Learning Content Management hosts the learning content and makes it available for Soldiers to take training anytime, anywhere. The Release shall support 50,000 Sustained, concurrent users.  The Release shall support 1.8 million unique active users annually.  The final Release will subsume all remaining legacy systems by FY 2024.

The next four systems are not part of the ATIS Development program. 

2.  DLPT5 Content Analysis, Categorization &amp; Modeling Development of DLPT5 Content Analysis, Categorization and Modeling (CACM) capabilities. For integration within the DLIFLC MIT LL TIDWA Domino system. These capabilities are in direct response to DLIFLC's DoDI assigned responsibilities for DLPT item bank maintenance, psychometric analysis and informed pool management, and closely support the DLPT Validity Framework.  MIT LL Networked Pronunciation Feedback Program (NETProf) expansion will allow for further expansion and further utilization of the existing NetProF products for DLIFLC faculty and students. To reach higher levels of proficiency in foreign languages the planned dialog system would give an advantage to DLIFLC teachers to help students gain advances through practicing speaking using this new dialog system, and the connected NetProF improvement system for pronunciation for longer utterances. This feasibility study will help set new parameters for developing very advanced language teaching systems that otherwise could not be supported. This is in support of the 2+/2+/2 plan.

3.  Universal Course Authoring Tool / The UCAT (Universal Curriculum and Assessment Tool) will serve as the primary curriculum and assessment development tool for curriculum development projects in meeting the directives from higher headquarters to transition into a new, digital learning environment. UCAT will support the delivery of curriculum and assessment products on a variety of different platforms in support of both resident and non-resident programs. UCAT consists of server-side applications and associated web services, databases, and client-side components which are currently under development.

4.  The Army Career Tracker is leader development tool that leverages Army's prior investments to integrate education, training, assignment, self-development and other systems by linking these valuable technologies and resources into a common user-friendly portal across 1.35 million users consisting of enlisted, officers, and civilians.  Users can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership. ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now. ACT allows users to manage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals. ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning. The unique inter-relationship between the user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and Army's success. Users manage their lifelong learning career objectives, monitor progress towards career development and goals, search multiple Army education and training resources, and receive personalized advice from their supervisor and Army leadership.  Completed development will modernize the Army Career Tracker (ACT) system to render web pages correctly base on the size of the screen. Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design that renders web pages based on the size of the device's display screen (e.g., computer, tablet, and phone). This allows the site to load quickly and ensures the display appears as if it were made expressly for the device being used. RWD improves user experience by displaying messages, links, and controls in a logical manner regardless of the device. The actual presentation may not look the same across different devices; rather the rendering will depend on the Operating System (OS), screen size, screen resolution, and other factors. Implementing RWD on ACT would be a step forward toward allowing ACT to render better on tablets and other mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones).

5.  Enhancement of Army Training Models (ATM) will provide the resources to build and sustain readiness requirements in a standardized process for automated methodology development and resource allocation in support of the Army's training needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Army Training Information System (ATIS) is an enterprise system that will provide a common operational picture (COP) of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities. These capabilities will enable Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess training requirements so they can more effectively plan, prepare, execute, and assess training. End result is an ATIS that enables Soldiers to train as they will fight, so they can effectively fight as they have trained.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army Training Information System (ATIS) is a Category II Defense Business System and will follow the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) in accordance with DoD 5000.75. ATIS will  comprise of Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) and/or Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) that will provide a Common Operational Picture (COP) of the training environment. ATIS will provide Army Commanders, leaders, Soldiers and civilians with a Common Operating Picture (COP) of the Training Environment (TE) that enables situational awareness, effective planning, preparation, execution, and assessments of training readiness.  ATIS will reduce the lifecycle costs of training by retiring more than 28 duplicative, stove-piped systems and improve performance with a net centric, standards-based, architecturally compliant system for the entire Army Training Environment.

The overarching acquisition strategy is divided into three distinct phases.
-  Phase I (Prototyping) - Program Risk Mitigation. Characterized by the  selection of three vendors to develop, demonstrate and deliver to the Government three ATIS Prototype systems and technical approach documentation.  The prototype project was awarded to the C5 Consortium Group to three vendors:  KBR, Perspecta, and CGI.  (Completed)  
-  Phase II (Development) - Each Prototype will be evaluated at the end of the Phase I and one vendor will be selected for engineering, development and deployment of  the ATIS production system. This phase be executed as a single-vendor logical follow-on to the competitively awarded prototyping effort under Other Transaction Authority (OTA), as specifically authorized by 10 U.S.C Section 2371b. This is a streamlined method for transitioning successful prototype projects into follow-on production.
-  Phase III - (Sustainment) - Upon full deployment of the system, a Sustainment Contract will be awarded for support and potential disposal of the system at the end of its useful life. ATIS intends to use Interim Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS) for initial sustainment beginning at Limited Deployment and will then transition to a hybrid life-cycle sustainment using a combination of CLS and government entities at Full Deployment (FD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Description>Criminal Investigative Management System (CIMS). CIMS, formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG).  Through CIMS, the USACIDC and the OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program / system that houses both classified and unclassified Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data.  CIMS leverages existing and future Army Law Enforcement (LE) enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) providing Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence functions as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  The Consolidated Operations Police Suite (COPS) was previously comprised of five separate applications: two of these applications have been rationalized under ALERTS; the remaining three (related to the Army Corrections discipline) require modernization to ensure continued function and security compliance. RDT&amp;E dollars are required to further enhance &amp; enable CIMS? consolidation/rationalization of LE applications thereby providing the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime while also facilitating the management of those placed in corrections facilities.  At present, all requested CID RDT&amp;E funding in program element 0605013A will be applied to CIMS initiatives.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The US Military Entrance Processing Command Integrated Resource System (MIRS) provides automation and communications capabilities to support the peacetime, mobilization and wartime military manpower accession mission for the Armed Services. USMEPCOM conducts its work through 65 Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) across the country and 189 Military Entrance Test Sites (METS). MIRS provides automated support for conducting aptitude tests and medical examinations and administratively processing, enlisting and shipping applicants for the Armed Forces, Reserves, and Coast Guard. This includes support for automated versions of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) tests. MIRS initiates Social Security Administration (SSA) checks for identity verification; interfaces with US Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) to verify citizenship status for military service applicants to screen out individuals that may be security threats; and interfaces with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for background screening, using digital fingerprints to identify/eliminate individuals with criminal records from entering military service. 

USMEPCOM reports operationally to the Office of the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness and has an executive agency (EA) agreement with the Army. USMEPCOM serves all five uniformed services, but only receives funding from the Army to perform its mission.

MIRS supports recruiting capabilities through electronic interfaces and data sharing, using standard Department of Defense (DoD) data elements with Recruiting Service systems. In the event a military draft is required, MIRS supports mobilization through electronic links with the Selective Service System (SSS) as well as automated support for conducting aptitude tests and medical examinations and administratively processing, inducting and shipping SSS registrants. 

Customers/beneficiaries of this investment: the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI), including components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, USMEPCOM, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Personnel &amp; Readiness (P&amp;R)

Requested funding underpins system sustainability and scalability and improves cybersecurity to include protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Funding covers costs to redesign/develop existing MIRS capabilities to operate efficiently in a cloud environment and to integrate with MHS-Genesis. This will allow for the closure of 65 Army data centers, in support of the Army Data Center Consolidation Plan (Army Directive 2016-38) and movement towards the Force of the Future mandate of all digital processing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The overall effort of the USMEPCOM IT transformation is to modernize and fully digitize the US Military Entrance Processing Command Integrated Resource System (MIRS). The modernization of the system will minimize vulnerabilities and fully digitize 65 military entrance processing stations resulting in efficiencies to all five uniformed services.

The modernization of the USMIRS system is being accomplished using the agile method of software development in short time-boxed "sprints". Program management functions were being performed by the Defense Digital Service (DDS). DDS managed an prototype development contract with a local consulting firm called Tandem (previously known as Devmynd. Based in Chicago IL). The DDS/Tandem effort ended in December of CY2019 and produced a prototype. An in-house program management element of USMEPCOM will manage a follow-on contract to turn the prototype USMIRS 1.1 into a deployable system in FY21.

The efforts in FY21 and beyond will be to develop the non-core applications of USMIRS 1.1 (plug in items to the main system that communicate with other systems across all five uniformed services to include Army Accession Information Environment (AIE)). The contracting for this is being done through GSA Chicago as the owning contract agency. This will most likely be awarded in October of FY2021 with work beginning in October.

Milestones:
1 - Core USMIRS 1.1 prototype delivered in December of Calendar 2019.
2 - Award contract to develop core USMIRS 1.1 prototype into a Minimum Viable Product that can be deployed to the field in 2Q FY2021.
3 - Award contract to develop the USMIRS 1.1 non-core applications (plug ins) in 1Q FY2021 with work to begin 2Q FY2021.
4 - FY22 and beyond will be to primarily establish the link between various systems (AIE, MHS Genesis Etc).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Force Information Management (GFIM): GFIM is a Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI) compliant, integrated, and interoperable digital environment that enables, thru automation, the Deploy to Redeploy/Retrograde (D2RR) end-to-end business processes in support of Dynamic Force Employment (DFE). Today, over 85% of this core Army Business Process is done manually and the tools that are available are on outdated technology platforms. GFIM will provide the tools necessary to dynamically develop, design, and document the Army's force structure at rest and in motion. GFIM will evolve both long-term and immediate bridging solutions that integrate and automate Army operational business processes, using an interoperable, collaborative environment, to enable the seamless exchange of authoritative data across the operational community of practice to provide rapid, accurate, and auditable outcomes to support risk informed senior leader decisions. GFIM will provide the core data necessary for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, other Business Mission Area (BMA) systems and Warfighting Mission Area (WMA) systems to efficiently and effectively execute business processes in support of Army Title 10 responsibilities and war fighting operations.

The Student Information Repository (SIR) Application will replace several independent applications and business processes used to track student data including, but not limited to, personal information, grades, attendance, official records, transcripts, teaching teams, student assignments, and surveys. It is a customized information system that is comprised of separate modules that are tied in together as one system.
      
The Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.   It includes a new effort in FY 2014, the Army Contract Writing System, a replacement for the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Modernization requirements will add new capabilities to legacy IT systems that support human resource functions such as organization and position management, training, and employment.  The PPB BOS system standardize and integrate the transactional information systems used in the Headquarters Department of Army (HQDA)  Programming and Budgeting processes.   The program is streamlining programming and budgeting business processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The PPB BOS architecture reengineers, streamlines, and consolidates HQDA systems and financial feeder systems; aligns to the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA); implements powerful business intelligence analytical tools to support strategic planning, programming, and budgeting within HQDA; and provides access to GFEBS funds management and execution data through system interfaces with required SFIS compliancy integral to the PPB BOS data model.  The LEAP program will provide criminal intelligence querying and reporting capabilities in compliance with regulatory and policy standards for Army Law Enforcement regarding investigation of felony crimes.  LEAP captures criminal case investigative information regarding incidents, location descriptors, entities (name, social security number, rank, title, physical characteristics, sex, birth place, and date), agent assignment, crime description and identifiers, statements, property data, laboratory tests; verifies and stores this data for criminal intelligence purposes: and reports this information to the proper authorities from the Division Commanding Officer to the United States Grand Jury.  The system will extract necessary data for consolidation and input to Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) monthly reports, National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) monthly reports and the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII) daily updates.  The LIMS system will automate business processes that support the forensic examiners. These processes include, but are not limited to, analytics, materials management, management reporting, Freedom of Information Act requests (FOIA), legal discovery request, court preparation and outsource processing.

Civilian Personnel Online - Portal (CPOL-Portal) is a one stop secure site which provides Army civilian employees and HR specialists access to a private portal with a complete set of employment related resources, links and web based applications that require single sign-on access - Army Regional Tools (ART). CPOL-Portal will provide an Integrated Management System (IMS) in support of Civilian Workforce Transformation (CWT). It will support Civilian human capital decision making and allow leaders and
employees to perform their roles more efficiently in support of Army goals and missions. CPOL Portal will provide the full spectrum of IT application support and access to Acquire, Develop, Distribute and Sustain components of the Army Civilian HCM Life-Cycle and link to G3 'Structure' IT Enterprise Applications.

The Fully Automated System for Classification (FASCLASS) is a centralized, web-based system that maintains civilian position descriptions and position related information across Department of the Army.  It provides classifiers and managers capability to create, edit, and verify position descriptions.  Also it offers robust search, report generation, and lookup &amp; support capabilities.

The Overseas Entitlement Tracker (OET) provides the capability to accurately track Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). LQA is provided to reimburse employees for suitable, adequate living quarters at posts where the U.S. Government does not provide quarters. OET also tracks these other overseas entitlements for employees: Advance Pay, Danger Pay, Imminent Danger Pay, Foreign Differential, Home Leave, Post Allowance, Separation Maintenance Allowance, and Temporary Quarters Subsistence Allowance.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>ARIMS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>ARIMS is the Army?s policy and enterprise system deployed to meet statutory (36 CFR) and regulatory (AR 25-1, AR 25-400-2) requirements to manage records that document the policies, decisions, and actions of the Army both as a military department and federal institution. ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY 2018) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army?s classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army?s records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations. Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems. These skill sets are not maintained by government staff and must, by DoD directive (C3I), be acquired from the private sector.

This application uses full motion video, graphics, and sound to train clients; and schedules clients for classroom-type instruction. It integrates a complete range of transition services and benefits for service members, Department of Defense civilian employees, and their family members as they transition from the military. TAP-XXI is a web-based, three-tiered application with a centralized database for all Transition sites. The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers.  The requirements in place today represent a 300 percent increase over the pre-VOW requirements.  A significant modernization effort within TAP XXI is needed.  Justification: ($ in Millions) FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.606 million resources the TAP XXI modernization requirements.  Planned Program includes modernize client management module, Soldier module, and increase reporting capabilities.

                                <r2:Remarks>Global Force Information Management (GFIM):  GFIM will provide the Army an enterprise, integrated authoritative force management capability for lifecycle management of force/organizational structure data for the entire Army.  In addition, it will establish a common data standard for force structure data by implementing the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI).  

Army Training Information System (ATIS) is an enterprise system that will provide a common operational picture of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities.  These capabilities will enable commanders, leaders, soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess training requirements so they can more effectively plan, prepare, execute, and assess training. End result is an ATIS that enables soldiers to train as they fight so they can effectively fight as they have trained. 

The Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&amp;E will be applied. One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).

 HRC Core IT: Award date shown reflects iPERMS IT Integration Contract.  SMS-WEB and ASBS 2.0 are on the Digital Application Support Task Order (DASTO) with an award date of  6 Feb 2018.</r2:Remarks>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to reserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System - Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps.  Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ASMIS-R is comprised of legacy modules (applications) that require modernization to maintain their relevancy to the Army in support of mishap reduction. As stated
above, these are primarily related to meeting minimum DoD regulatory requirements related to the collection of mishap information, safety information storage, and
resolving inefficiencies in data quality control and information flow.

Additionally, advances in technology allow for improvements in performance and data integrity that currently are deficiencies in the system. ASMIS-R, in its current state,
does not provide any IT (material solution) to the business requirements identified above. The Command has utilized a FFP contract to execute specific Task Orders
to develop the tools and products through mid-year FY 2015. The CRC will be competing a new contract vehicle to support the development of products and tools from
midyear FY 2015 through FY 2024.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Army Leader Dashboard (ALD) is not a new start. On 10 May 2018 an Above Threshold Reprograming (ATR) was approved by the House Appropriations Committee-Defense (HAC-D) for $7.4 million used to award an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to five vendors and to complete Phase 1 of the prototype development efforts (Program Element - 0605013A / Project Number T05).  In addition, ALD was allocated $9.575 million (FY 2019 RDT&amp;E) to fund Phase 2 of the prototype development efforts in FY 2019.  In FY 2020, the ALD program was given its own Project Number (XV6) under Program Element 0605013A / Information Technology Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Leader Dashboard (ALD) is a large data management platform and tailorable solution that integrates, analyzes, and visualizes information from multiple disparate data sources, both classified and unclassified.  Information relayed by the system will include timely, precise, and accurate reports and indicators for readiness, manning, equipping, training, sustainment, acquisition, and cyber security capabilities at all levels from the individual Soldier or item, to Unit levels, and to the strategic level.

The ALD will provide Army senior leaders and other users near real-time visibility and access to Army data, facilitating rapid decision making while supporting strategic, operational, and tactical planning.  The ALD is one of the Chief of Staff, Army's top priorities and is endorsed by senior leaders across the entire Army.

In FY 2021 Project XV6 ALD transitions to sustainment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>During the acquisition, testing, and deployment phase the ALD program office will perform all development, data integration, test, and deployment activities for a data management and visualization solution that encapsulates all Army data.  During the Capability Support Phase when the ALD system is in production, ALD will continue to establish automated connections to existing Army data (also known as Authoritative Data Sources (ADSs)). To date, ALD has identified more than 600 ADSs that will require automated data ingestion.  This is a major increase from the initial requirement which focused solely on readiness (108 ADSs). The ALD team has assessed all 600+, categorized them by complexity, priority/value, and sunset/retirement dates.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Army Leader Dashboard (ALD) has also requested Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) dollars PB 2020 to fund the Production phase as a Software as a Service (SaaS) contract. The O&amp;M dollars will maintain the selected system - licenses, helpdesk hosting, cybersecurity, and all supporting sustainment activity requirements.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In Section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2016, Public Law 114-92, Congress amended DoD's authority to carry out prototype projects using Other Transaction (OT) agreements.  The OT agreements are now permanently codified in 10 U.S.C. Section 2371b, titled "Authority of the Department of Defense to Carry out Certain Prototype Projects" and offer a streamlined method for selecting and conducting prototype projects. The ALD program office is taking advantage of this useful acquisition tool to procure ALD prototypes rapidly.  Section 2371b requires that competitive procedures be used "to the maximum extent practicable," and the ALD is using a "full and open" Prototype Proposal Opportunity Notice (PPON) to achieve maximum competition.

In addition to the system functional requirements, a directed needs statement directs the program to:
- Procure no less than two, and not more than four, prototypes for user assessment, development of application protocol interfaces, and development of selected software interfaces with designated Authoritative Data Sources.
- Phase the program to deliver an initial capability of two to four prototypes no later than 30 days (from award announcement) that allows assessment of the awarded two to four prototypes and a final comparison tradeoff. The results will lead to a follow-on award of one to two prototypes for an additional assessment phase upon execution of a Decision Point.

In actuality, ALD selected five vendors to compete in Phase 1 of the prototype development (August 2019 through December 2019) which resulted in two vendors moving onto Phase 2 of the prototype development.  The ALD program office is currently conducting/completing Phase 2 with one vendor (down-selected to one on 26 June 2019).  Production will be acquired separately, as a sole-sourced contract, leveraging the research and information captured during the two prototyping phases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>IPPS-A Increment II (Project ED9), formerly designated as an Acquisition Category IA Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program under the authority of DoDI 5000.02, transitioned under the acquisition authority of DoDI 5000.75 to a Business System Category I (BSC 1) program as a result of the Release 2 Limited Deployment Decision Memorandum signed 3 May 2019.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army (IPPS-A) Increment II provides an integrated, multi-Component, personnel and pay system, which streamlines the existing Human Resources (HR) systems and processes enhancing efficiency and accuracy of personnel and pay procedures in support of 1.1 million Soldiers and their Families.  IPPS-A will subsume approximately 40 legacy systems (full and partial) across the Active, Reserve and National Guard Components into one single integrated system.  IPPS-A is a web-based tool, available 24-hours a day, accessible to HR professionals, Combatant Commanders, pay managers and other authorized users throughout the Army.  IPPS-A addresses major deficiencies in the delivery of military personnel and pay services by providing the necessary internal control and audit procedures as well as preventing erroneous payments and loss of funds. This program is an essential building block to reform the Department towards achieving greater performance and affordability in support of the National Defense Strategy and the Congressional audit mandate. 

IPPS-A Increment II is the #1 HR Modernization effort in the Army and will deliver fully integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components building on the trusted database delivered by the IPPS-A Increment I program.  The program is the critical enabler for The Army People Strategy and its transition to a Talent Management System and an HR data-rich environment.  Increment II will link the personnel and pay functions for all Army personnel eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing complex system maintenance, and minimizing pay discrepancies. IPPS-A Increment II will account for status changes between Active and Reserve/National Guard Components to ensure accurate credit for service and individual pay as well as enable disciplined human resource management. 

FY 2021 requested budget supports the revised Acquisition Strategy approved by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on 24 July 2019, and provides for the development of Release 3 Personnel System supporting the Total Force.  The revised Acquisition Strategy removes the schedule concurrency, thereby reducing complexity and shifting risks to the vendor by changing the Release 3 System Integrator development contract structure from cost plus to firm fixed.  The new "heel-to-toe" release development strategy is, in part, a result of rescinded statutory acquisition mandate, 10 United States Code Chapter 144A, Major Automated Information System (MAIS) Programs, which originally required completion of a program from initiation to the Full Deployment Decision within five years.  This restriction forced substantial schedule compression and necessitated the high risk scheduling of concurrent releases to meet requirements within the prescribed timeframe.  The revised schedule allows for a focused and systematic development, integration and delivery of the new HR and Pay system for the Total Force.  Further, the revised program has facilitated the execution of Business Process Reengineering on a significant scale - allowing the Army to reduce from 154 HR Business Processes to 52.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>FY 2021 increase of $13.213 million reflects the change in the funding level to support the revised Increment II Acquisition Strategy, which the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approved on 24 July 2019. On 7 January 2020, the AAE further approved the re-baseline Authority to Proceed (ATP) with the program's revised cost, schedule and performance values.  With this decision, the Army has extended the program's Increment II schedule focusing on the development of a Minimum Viable Solution (MVS) for its new HR and Pay system while reducing concurrent development of multiple releases.  The revised cost incorporates Release 2 (Personnel System for National Guard) lessons learned, revised System Integrator contract structure (cost plus to firm fixed) and the complexity of known risks associated with interfacing 60+ systems.  FY 2020 Congressionally adjusted funding level reflects, a one-time, FY 2019 System Integrator's cost under-run as a result of successive month-to-month contract extensions during the program re-baseline.  With the new approved program baseline and revised firm fixed contract in place, potential for further under-run is not foreseen.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>B66706000 (OPA) funding supports initial system implementation and fielding of IPPS-A to include new equipment training (NET). Training delivery methods include: Instructor-led Training, Distance Learning, and Computer Based Training of 66,000 HR transactional users for Increment II.  Training products will be developed using the Oracle Usability Productivity Kit to include instructor manuals and lessons plans, as well as Electronic Performance Support System and job aids.  The deployment approach will implement pre-deployment activities at each location beginning 360 days in advance of the deployment start date.  Deployment will include an on-site data verification, workflow verification, and "over-the-shoulder" support.

432612000 (O&amp;M, OMA) and 435107000 (civilian pay, OMA) funding supports overall sustainment including Help Desk support (Tier I through Tier II), system maintenance break/fixes, minor enhancements, software licenses, cyber compliance, program office contractor support, civilian salaries, and program office operations.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2222, IPPS-A Increment II (Project ED9) is a Priority Business System Category I (BCAT 1) program that achieved a Milestone (MS) B on 14 December 2014, while under DODI 5000.02 oversight. IPPS-A will deliver fully integrated personnel and pay services to all Army Components (Active, National Guard, and Reserve) building on the trusted database delivered by the IPPS-A Increment I program. In FY 2019, the program transitioned to DODI 5000.75 oversight, and at the direction of Army Senior Leaders, completed a restructure and re-baseline.  On 24 July 2019, the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) signed the new Increment II Acquisition Strategy.  The new strategy reduces risk by minimizing concurrent development and focuses on deployment of a Minimum Viable Solution (MVS) for the remaining Increment II releases and defers additional capability to the Capability Support Phase.  On 7 January 2020, the AAE signed the new Acquisition Program Baseline approving the program's new cost, schedule and performance values.  The re-baselined Increment II  schedule consists of three software releases (2.0, 3.0, and 4.0) that build upon one another, culminating in a MVS personnel and pay solution for the Total Force.
 
Release 2.0 Full Release - The full Release 2.0 replaces the Standard Installation/Division Personnel System (SIDPERS) at Army National Guard (ARNG) units in all 54 states and territories.  The release 2.0 design effort began in FY15. End-to-end Business Process development considerations were evaluated to support various activities to include, but not limited to, promotions/demotions, training requirements, member benefits, duty status, and unit level manning.  The program achieved a successful Release 2 Limited Deployment ATP in May 2019.  By the end of calendar year 2019 the program deployed Release 2 to the ARNG in 27 states (180k users) and is on schedule to complete all deployments by April 2020.

Release 3.0 MVS - Release 3.0 MVS will provide all accountability and essential personnel services necessary to subsume numerous legacy field systems including Electronic Military Personnel Office (eMILPO) and Total Army Personnel Database-Reserve (TAPDB-R). It will allow Commanders in the field to access timely, accurate, and standardized personnel data for Soldiers in all Components. In addition to delivering most of the functions required to establish an Army-wide personnel system, Release 3.0 MVS will bring HR payroll drivers on board to enhance accuracy of pay, credit for service, and benefits. IPPS-A will serve as the authoritative data source for all personnel within the system. Design work began in FY 2017, but was not completed due to the program's need to focus on completing Release 2.0. The final design effort was completed in November 2019, and the program awarded a contract modification for Release 3.0 MVS build, testing and deployment on 22 November 2019.  Release 3 MVS is scheduled for deployment to the Total Force in December 2021.

Release 4.0 MVS - Release 4.0 MVS will provide a fully integrated personnel and pay system to the Total Force. The program began work on Release 4.0 in FY 2018 but executed a stop work order in January 2019 as a result of the program's need to focus on Release 3.0 and re-baseline Increment II. As part of the new program strategy, the program will conduct a full and open competition for Release 4.0 MVS and other follow-on activities, including system Capability Support, with the goal to award a contract in 1QFY22 to support delivery to the Total Force in 3QFY25. Release 4.0 MVS will incorporate pay functionality to include, but not limited to, base pay, taxes, allowances, bonuses, allotments and leave. At deployment, Release 4.0 MVS will serve as the authoritative data source for all personnel and pay transactions and will satisfy Army audit goals.
 
Capability Support Phase (CSP) - Anticipated in FY26, after Release 4.0 MVS is deployed and the program achieves Full Operational Capability, the program will conduct a CSP Authority to Proceed (APT) decision.  During this ATP, the Functional Sponsor will approve entry of the Inc II capability into the CSP.  The IPPS-A Inc II program will continue to sustain, modernize, and enhance the IPPS-A capability during this phase.  Depending on available funding in FY 2026-FY 2030, the program may develop the Release 3.0 and Release 4.0 additional capabilities ahead of the planned schedule.  These additional capabilities were deferred earlier in the program to focus on development and deployment of the Release 3.0 and Release 4.0 MVS.  In accordance with Army leader direction, the program remains poised to begin development of a limited number of the Release 3.0 additional capabilities as early as FY 2023, in parallel with Release 4 MVS development, if so directed.  This may be necessary to ensure evolving Talent Management, Strength Management, Archiving and Internal Control requirements can be addressed to support Army objectives and audit requirements in a timely manner.  Early development of these limited additional capabilities will only be done when directed by Army senior leaders.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the materiel solution for replacement of the Army's Armored Personnel Carrier (M113) Family of Vehicles (FoV) within the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). It will mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability across the Spectrum of Conflict. The AMPV will replace five mission roles currently performed by the M113 FoV by transferring the current M113 Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) to a new Military Vehicle Derivative (MVD) platform. In total, the AMPV FoV will account for approximately 30% of the ABCT's tracked fleet and consists of the following five variants:
1. Mission Command (MCmd) Vehicle: This platform enables effective mission command planning and execution for both the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and Tactical Command (TAC) Vehicle versions of the MCmd. It will host current Battle Command Systems, future replacements, and upgrades of hardware and software.
2. Medical Treatment (MT) Vehicle: This platform will provide a protected surgical environment, with adequate lighting and accessible medical equipment. It will provide a capability for immediate medical care for one patient by a medical crew of four.
3. Medical Evacuation (ME) Vehicle: This platform will conduct ambulance type activities and provide casualty evacuation for up to four litters or six ambulatory patients, with a crew of three medical attendants.
4. General Purpose (GP) Vehicle: This platform will operate throughout the battle space by conducting re-supply, maintenance, casualty evacuation, and other tasks within the formation.
5. Mortar Carrier (MC) Vehicle: This platform will provide immediate responsive fire support to conduct fast-paced offensive operations.

The AMPV program was initiated with a Capability Development Document (CDD) that was approved on 21 June 2013 and subsequently revised on 24 October 2016. The CDD reflects a set of stable, technologically achievable requirements. A Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was held on 9 December 2014 and it was followed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) that was signed on 22 December 2014. The ADM approved MS B for the AMPV program and entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. In addition, the ADM authorized the Army to proceed with award of the EMD prime contract, which occurred on 23 December 2014 to BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments, L.P. (BAE). A subsequent ADM was issued on 26 September 2017 and it approved: a revised acquisition documentation tailoring plan, revised Milestone C entrance criteria, and an increase in the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity to 551 vehicles (to recognize the Army's desire for early fielding of AMPVs for the European Deterrence Initiative). An ADM was then issued on 1 November 2017 and it delegated Milestone Decision Authority to the Secretary of the Army and re-designated AMPV as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC program. An Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) was held on December 20, 2018 with the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) and the Vice Chief of Staff Army (VCSA) approving the program to enter LRIP. The program received its LRIP ADM on January 25, 2019.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 planned program primarily consists of efforts associated with Production Qualification Testing (PQT), Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E), and the Production and Deployment phase Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E). Prime contractor support will be required for testing and engineering to ensure adequate system support packages will be available during the tests. Government test locations will be used for the tests and government personnel will be responsible for the overall management of the efforts.  This program supports the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) Cross Functional Team (CFT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Government test costs in FY 2020 were primarily related to the planning and execution of risk reduction validation testing at ATC using EMD vehicles which have been modified with design upgrade packages intended for production, mortar ammunition qualification testing, and the detailed planning of PQT Production and Deployment phase LFT&amp;E, and IOT to be conducted in FY 2021. The risk reduction validation testing included performance and reliability testing, and ballistic Live Fire testing at ATC.  The performance and reliability testing were scheduled to begin in the 1Q FY 2020 and continue until early 3Q FY 2020. These tests were conducted on two vehicles. The Live Fire testing was scheduled to begin in the 2Q FY 2020 and conclude 4Q FY 2020 or 1Q FY 2021. This was conducted on four vehicles. The performance and reliability testing included a total of 3,000 miles and selected performance sub-tests. The Live Fire tests included a total of eight under-body blast events. The mortar ammunition qualification test is an off-vehicle test designed to validate that the AMPV Mortar Carrier variant can safely transport mortar ammunition. This testing was conducted in 2Q FY 2020 at YTC. Government costs included all costs incurred at ATC and costs associated with Government personnel that were collecting/analyzing test data, as well as work associated with providing oversight of the test activities. Finally, as required, vehicle design updates incorporated as corrective actions may be proven out on modified prototype vehicles at select Government test locations. All Government costs incurred as a result of these tests were included in this element.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Government Test costs in FY 2021 reflect LRIP testing activities, test data evaluation, and final reporting for PQT, LFT&amp;E and IOT&amp;E. The following test activities are scheduled in FY 2021 per the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) approved at Milestone C: PQT (Performance and RAM), Full-Up System Level (FUSL), LFT&amp;E, and IOT&amp;E. PQT is scheduled to begin 4QFY2020 and complete in 4QFY2021, with the exception of natural environmental testing that will continue into 3QFY2022.  LFT&amp;E will begin in 1QFY2021 and end in 4QFY2021. Currently, a total of 25 vehicles will undergo PQT. As part of PQT, and in support of RAM assessments, six vehicles will run a total of 14,000 miles. The miles will be equally split between the ATC and the YTC. An additional 19 vehicles will undergo performance testing as part of PQT. This testing will be performed at ATC, YTC, WSMR, EPG, CRTC, TRTC, and DPG. PQT is conducted with production-representative vehicles from LRIP. The objectives include verification that the production-representative systems meet performance requirements, generation of data to support the system evaluation in support of the FRP decision, and determination of system readiness to enter IOT. Government costs include all costs incurred at the test sites and costs associated with Government personnel that will be collecting/analyzing test data, as well as personnel associated with providing oversight of the activities. The LFT&amp;E will yield information to complement earlier vulnerability tests and modeling and analysis efforts. It will also be used to fill data voids from prior testing and will validate ballistic and blast performance at the system level to completely evaluate vehicle, crew, and occupant survivability. Ten vehicles will undergo testing at ATC. There are three elements to the testing: CDE, FUSL testing. CDE will be conducted on selected subsystems integrated into the AMPV to determine the consequences of various types of damage. This information will be used to confirm the impact of subsystem damage on platform functionality. Fire Survivability Testing will generate the data required to evaluate the effectiveness of the AFES. Its purpose is to protect crews and internal, stowed equipment from fires expected to be initiated by ballistic impacts. FUSL testing will demonstrate the ballistic resiliency and crew survivability of fully functional, production-representative, combat-loaded AMPV variants and investigate the synergistic effects of various damage mechanisms and failure modes. 30 AMPV LRIP vehicles will participate in the IOT&amp;E, with an additional 6 AMPV LRIP vehicles located at the test location to serve as back-up vehicles. The IOT&amp;E events will be conducted under realistic operational conditions using Army units executing decisive action operations IAW U.S. Army doctrine against a representative OPFOR. The test events are designed to produce data to satisfy the evaluation requirements in order to assess the operational effectiveness and suitability of the system under test. The AMPV IOT&amp;E is scheduled to be conducted 4QFY2021-1QFY2022. The location of the IOT will be determined by the Army TSARC based on availability of units and maneuver area (At this time the location is assumed to be Ft. Stewart, GA). PM AMPV will plan and coordinate any follow-on developmental and/or operational testing that will be required due to configuration changes during production, or verification that any post production deficiencies in materiel, training, or concepts have been satisfactorily corrected. PM AMPV will support Instructor and Key Personnel Training (I&amp;KPT), OPNET, and FLMNET. PM AMPV will provide a NMIB to the IOT unit prior to OPNET, and finalize with the unit the target audience for New Equipment Training.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is an Automated Information System (AIS) program. IGSSR-C has a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities. The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE).

This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations. IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.

IGSSR-C is a software centric system providing video analytics and common control of force protection systems that will reduce the workload on the system operator. The system will be capable. of ingesting full motion video as well as sensor data from legacy and emerging FP systems, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and a COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>IGSSR-C provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems. The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013. IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Sensor CE efforts.

The IGSSR-C program received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015, and achieved a Milestone B decision on 29 Sep 2017.

The acquisition strategy for IGSSR-C was approved on 5 December 2016 by the MDA, which approved plans to leverage a contract through the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to develop, integrate and test the software solution to meet the IGSSR-C requirements.

Milestone C is planned for 4th quarter of FY 2020</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) is funded using a Joint budget strategy. Each Military Department (MILDEP) budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&amp;E requirements for joint efforts. Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 to FY 2020 funding reflects the full JTNC requirement with the consolidated funding from the other Services, while FY 2021 and beyond reflects the Army one-third portion of total program RDT&amp;E funds. Out-year funding is programmed in PE 0605030A by the Army, PE 0605030N by the Navy and PE 0605030F by the Air Force. Prior to submission of the President's Budget, the funding is consolidated in PE 0605030A via RMD for execution.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

The JTNC is responsible for ensuring secure, interoperable, and resilient tactical communications capabilities aligned to modular open architectures in support of Service, Multi-Service, and Coalition forces. The JTNC: (1) maintains a cyber-hardened DoD Information Repository (IR), (2) provides Technical Analyses/Capability Characterizations on tactical communications products, (3) provides Open Systems Architecture Standards, (4) exportability analysis and licensing reviews, and (5) serves as Technical Advisor to the Communications, Command, and Control Leadership Board (C3LB).

This mission is executed in conjunction with other government agencies to include the National Security Agency (NSA), the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), the National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA), the Services, as well as Matrix and Industry partners. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that interagency work is collaborative and eliminates duplicative capability. The JTNC enables a common software baseline that is hardware agnostic leading to increased competition for Software Defined Radios (SDR).

Through collaboration with DoD matrixed and industry partners, the JTNC supports continued development/maturation of the DoD IR, analysis of directed software and artifacts, support of the National Security Agency (NSA) Commercial Communications Security (COMSEC) Evaluation Program (CCEP), JTNC Standards Interface Control Working Group (ICWG), the Capabilities Characterization and Tactical Communications Marketplace (CC &amp; TCM), and Modular Radio Architecture (MRA).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Joint Tactical Networking Center is funded by all the Services. The Joint Funding Strategy requires each of the three Service Military Departments (MILDEPs) to budget for one-third of the total program approved requirement.  Army funding in FY 2022 and beyond reflects only approximately one-third of total funding.  Other funding is as follows (PB20 locked positions):

Navy RDTE: 0605030N, 3077.                FY 2021 = 0 // FY 2022 = 4,741 // FY 2023 = 4,835 // FY 2024 = 4,932 // FY 2025 = 5,031
Air Force RDTE:  0605030F, 655068.     FY 2021 = 0 // FY 2022 = 5,852 // FY 2023 = 5,969 // FY 2024 = 6,088 // FY 2025 = 6,210

Due to Joint Funding Strategy, there is no prior year funding for JTNC in the other Service lines. Prior to the year of execution, the JTNC funding is consolidated in Army
PE 0605030A for execution. In accordance with the Joint Tactical Networking Center Charter updated and re-validated on 13 September 2019, the JTNC will remain under a Joint Budget Strategy funded by the three MILDEPs.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) is a Joint support program to the Services, the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)), and USD Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)). JTNC core functions as defined in the JTNC Acquisition Decision Memorandum and Charter signed on 20 January 2014 and revalidated on 13 September 2019 include: Department of Defense (DoD) Information Repository (IR) management and configuration control, DoD Waveform Standards, technical analyses of Government Program of Record (POR) and Industry COTS and NDI Waveform products. The services derived from these core functions reinforce an acquisition environment which ensures that interoperable, secure, and resilient joint tactical waveforms and wireless communications applications can operate in a variety of hardware transport solutions.

The FY21 Budget supports continued development/maturation of the DoD IR, analysis of directed software and artifacts, support of the National Security Agency (NSA) Commercial Communications Security (COMSEC) Evaluation Program (CCEP), JTNC Standards Interface Control Working Group (ICWG), the Capabilities Characterization and Tactical Communications Marketplace (CC &amp; TCM). The FY21 budget supports the Lead Services initiative where JTNC will serve as a technical advisor and source of engineering and analytic resources in the conduct of Joint enterprise-level systems engineering and analysis and support DoD CIO. The FY21 budget supports Modular Radio Architecture (MRA) where JTNC will lead development and promulgation of a framework containing a collection of DoD standards and a description or architecture of how to use these to compose or control a communications system. The MRA defines how to implement a communications system or radio on select platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Responsibility for the development and sustainment of JENM was assigned to the PM Joint Tactical Networks (JTN) by the Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) of 20 Jan 2014. The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Command Control Communications Tactical (C3T) Memos of 25 Jun 2015 transferred all program, development, and configuration control of JENM by Product Manager (PdM) JENM under PM JTN to PdM Tactical Cyber Network Operations (TCNO) under PM Tactical Network (formally PM WIN-T) when Army became the Lead Service for JENM under the ADM's provisions.

Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) is funded using a Joint budget strategy. Each Military Department (MILDEP) budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&amp;E requirements for joint efforts. Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 to FY 2020 funding reflects the full JENM requirement with the consolidated funding from the other Services, while FY 2021 and beyond reflects the Army one-third portion of total program RDT&amp;E funds. Out-year funding is programmed in PE 0605031A by the Army, PE 0605031N by the Navy and PE 0605031F by the Air Force. USMC funding will be provided on an annual basis via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR). Prior to submission of the President's Budget, the funding is consolidated in PE 0605031A via RMD for execution.

JENM, funded in project EF5, is a software only program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>EF5 project: This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

The Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) software provides a single, converged network management tool allowing the Warfighter to plan, configure, load, and manage the Joint Services' Tactical Radios and their networks in the field - a capability not available in legacy planning systems. JENM configures several types of tactical radios, such as the ManPack and Rifleman, enabling them to utilize Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) and other waveforms to include: TrellisWare Scalable Manet (TSM), Warrior Robust Enhanced Network (WREN), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) waveform, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA), Integrated Waveform (IW), and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveform. Using its Over-the-Air-Management (OTAM) functionality, JENM provides the Commander the ability to quickly reconfigure critical networks. JENM enhances the S6's ability to conduct Course of Action (COA) Analysis and the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP), providing commanders critical information regarding their ability to communicate.

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>PE 0605031A contains only the JTN (PdM Waveforms and PdM TCNO (JENM)) RDTE funding.

Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) is funded using a Joint budget strategy. Each Military Department (MILDEP) budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&amp;E requirements for joint efforts. Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 to FY 2020 funding reflects the full JENM requirement with the consolidated funding from the other Services, while FY 2021 and beyond reflects the Army one-third portion of total program RDT&amp;E funds. Out-year funding is programmed in PE 0605031A by the Army, PE 0605031N by the Navy and PE 0605031F by the Air Force. USMC funding will be provided on an annual basis via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR). Prior to submission of the President's Budget, the funding is consolidated in PE 0605031A via RMD for execution.

JENM and baseline planning applications are deployed on the RAP-TR hardware from Division to the Company level. The RAP-TR hardware and JENM Logistics &amp; Training capabilities are captured under the Joint Network Management System OPA-2 line (JNMS B99318) FY21 and out.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Joint Tactical Network Center (JTNC) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) (July 2012) (JENM Supporting Role). Per the December 2014 Joint Tactical Network(JTN) Select Acquisition Report (SAR), JTN was 90% expended and changed to inactive. Defense Acquisition Management Information Retrieval (DAMIR) reflected the inactive status on 3 June 2015 JTN APB (13 October 2015) (JENM Supporting Role).

Product Manager Tactical Cyber &amp; Network Operations (TCNO) manages a Government Owned, Government Operated (GOGO) Software Development &amp; Integration Facility which employs competitive contracting strategies for software development &amp; sustainment of the network manager components to ensure warfighter access to the best technology and innovative capabilities while addressing emerging threats and future requirements via an affordable, operationally effective, and timely framework.

The Army will continue a prototyping effort that will plan, manage, and provision capabilities for simplified workflow based planning solutions to rapidly meet emerging capability requirements stemming from Network Cross Functional Team (CFT) initiatives and directed requirements.

JENM will support the completion of JENM v3.5 development, which include complete MUOS simplification, upgrades to JENM Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate management, and cyber enhancements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Description>Software Development efforts within PdM Waveforms are focused on the following:

1.Cyber Electro-Magnetic Activities (CEMA)
CEMA activities focus on impacting the adversary's ability to communicate while protecting and hardening Army capabilities and systems to prevent the adversary from doing the same. PdM manages and executes CEMA activities (i.e. Cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection, Intrusion Prevention, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Spectrum Management) in support of Capability Sets and Army Network Modernization to include:
   
Cap Set 21 - Increasing EW resilience and network "fail-over" options (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency (PACE))
Cap Set 23 - Refinement of Mesh Network (e.g. MANET) for all ITN formations and Broadcast WF (e.g. SINCGARS) and anti-jam improvements
Cap Set 25 - Identify and assess technologies for Automated PACE implementation

2. SINCGARS
- Development of a Frequency Hopping (FH)3 mode that will address the adversary's near and mid-term Electronic Attack (EA)/Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities which will be integrated into Capability Set (CS) 21
- Develop and provide a fully open development environment to government and vendors to help ensure standardization, interoperability, and provide the means to identify and mitigate porting issues and realize cost efficiencies 
- Develop requirements and advanced Waveform/Transportation Security (TRANSEC) capabilities to combat predicted threats in anticipation of next generation Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) (FH4) capability
- Development of a new MIL-STD to accurately and completely define SINCGARS for NATO and coalition interoperability
- Development of a NATO Standardized Agreement (STANAG) defining the SINCGARS interoperability mode FH2/Cipher Text (CT)2 for use by NATO and ABCANZ partners
- Development of NATO Narrowband (NB) and standards documentation

3. Radio Services and applications that enable NSA certified key and radio configuration management over the air (OTA) while reducing network overhead and providing user-simplified/standardized radio network configuration tools that support the Unified Network Line of Effort (LOE) for CSs through 2028

4.  Enterprise Over the Air Management (eOTAM) 2.0 will reduce OTA profile for bandwidth limited waveforms, upgrade security to meet current NSA policy for new products, and add radio health status and control capabilities needed for COTS products.  eOTAM will be converged with the Black Sails suite of radio/network configuration and control tools.

5.  Development and integration of Warrior Robust Enhanced Network Narrowband (WREN NB) (formerly known as Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)) Narrowband will allow for increased scalability, range, and communications in congested and contested environments, in both Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) bands. WREN NB will provide robust communications capabilities with smaller bandwidth requirements in support of the Network Resiliency and Hardened Radio Capabilities identified in the CSs' Unified Network LOE in FY 2021-2025.

6.  Integration of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) into waveforms will support the Warfighter by providing more efficient use of the limited spectrum resources, increasing spectrum availability in a congested Electromagnetic Environment (EME). The Army is in need of a  DSA capability that can react to the theater changes in near real-time communication networks. The DSA technology will allow Army networks to automatically adjust frequency based on geographical location to fit within spectrum allocations as the Army moves and fights in tactical theaters.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PdM Waveforms is responsible for common core activities including developing and updating legacy waveforms and analyzing Advance Networking Waveforms (ANWf) that operate on multiple radios sets and in all operational environments that support network-centric operational warfare.  Waveform developments (upgrading, developing, and maintaining) will generally be procured through full and open contract competitions.

Beginning in FY19, while maintaining legacy networking waveforms, PdM Waveforms implemented a pivoting strategy which focuses on vetting and analyzing ANWf. The Product Office has established working relationships with Industry Partners within the waveform market. The strategy consists of conducting initial analysis of commercial waveforms, documenting vulnerabilities, identifying implementation strategies, and making recommendations to senior leadership on potential Army use cases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System-Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities and will provide network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. GBOSS-E will replace obsolete, quick reaction capability (QRC) surveillance and force protections systems utilizing modular configurations: Light variant (man transportable/detachable) for extra small base camps or small outpost/company,Medium variant (mid sensor height) for small to medium size base, and Heavy variant (high level sensor height) for large contingency base camps. GBOSS-E will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System-Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities and will provide network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. GBOSS-E will replace obsolete, quick reaction capability (QRC) surveillance and force protections systems utilizing modular configurations: Light variant (man transportable/detachable) for extra small base camps or small outpost/company, Medium variant (mid sensor height) for small to medium size base, and Heavy variant (high level sensor height) for large contingency base camps. GBOSS-E will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.

FY21 Base funding in the amount of $5.981 million completes design engineering and integration activities, builds Low Rate initial Production (LRIP) engineering development models, conducts Initial Operational Test (IOT) and Logistics Demonstration, and provides Program Management support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Security System (TSS) is a modular, scalable, lightweight, rapidly deployable, ground based security and surveillance Family of Systems (FoS). The design of TSS allows for hasty emplacement and is tailorable to support short and long term security, surveillance and detection missions. The TSS and its components are designed to be employed as a stand-alone system, in a layered effort or integrated with additional force protection (FP) systems. Integration with additional sensors will be obtained through network communications and software in line with Net-Ready requirements. TSS will address four of the five base camp core protection/security capabilities identified in the Integrated Base Defense (IBD) Concept of Operations (CONOPS) which are perimeter security, entry control, persistent surveillance, warning and alerting. The TSS will be compliant with the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture and Implementation Plan. TSS is designed to be employed as a stand-alone system in a layered effort or integrated with additional force protection systems including motion, acoustic, seismic, surface, and detection technologies.

Tactical Security System (TSS) received Materiel Development Decision (MDD) approval on 6 January 2017.  The acquisition concept and contracting strategy for TSS was approved on 30 April 2018 by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to leverage an existing task order through Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide engineering and developmental support for the TSS design, development, and integration of an EDM and to support Operational Assessments (OA). Key efforts include the development of the EDM, testing and evaluation for TSS Key Performance Parameters (KPPs)/Key System Attributes (KSAs)/Additional Performance Parameters (APAs), and Developmental and Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E).  MS B was achieved on 29 October 2018.

Milestone C is planned for FY 2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) budget line includes funding to support the development and integration of Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) products onto Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) aircraft variants and future platforms.

The CIRCM budget line includes CIRCM (EB4) and funding to counter emerging technology as identified in Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) SO-0010 Phase 2a and the Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Directed Requirement for the Common Infrared Countermeasures Quick Reaction Capability (CIRCM QRC) approved in Nov 2018.  

CIRCM (EB4)
The CIRCM is the next generation lightweight, laser-based Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) component that will interface with both the Army's Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and future missile warning systems (MWS) to defeat current and emerging missile threats that use multispectral technology for rotary-wing, tilt-rotor and small fixed-wing aircraft across the DoD.  CIRCM receives an angular bearing hand-off from the MWS, employs a pointing and tracking system which acquires the handed-over threat and tracks the incoming missile during and after motor burnout. CIRCM jams the missile by using modulated laser energy in the missile seeker band, thus degrading the tracking capability of the missile and causing it to miss the aircraft.  CIRCM is utilizing Open Systems Architecture which allows flexibility with software and hardware refreshes.  These tech insertions, when coupled with future threat acquisition &amp; integration, will ensure CIRCM performance to keep pace with future threats. 

The CIRCM A-Kit includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft.  The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.  The CIRCM B-Kit is the mission kit (laser, pointer tracker, and controller) required to achieve near spherical coverage for an aircraft.

JUONS SO-0010 and CIRCM QRC
As a part of Phase 2a of the JUONS (SO-0010) program, the Army integrated the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system onto the Army and Special Operations Aircraft (SOA) platforms.  Due to a number of challenges, circumstances, and variables, the Army updated the Advanced Threat Warning (ATW)/CIRCM QRC and Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) Directed Requirements (dated November 16, 2018).  The updated requirements extend the utilization of ATW DoN LAIRCM on conventional Army aircraft and cancel the need for the ATW/CIRCM QRC system for the conventional Army.  (It should be noted that the updated requirement maintains the need for ATW/CIRCM on the Special Operations aircraft.)  As a result, the Army did not acquire the ATW sensors for use in Phase 3 of the JUONS effort.  Instead, the Army accelerated the procurement of the CIRCM QRC systems for use with the currently fielded CMWS in preparation for transition to the LIMWS system when available.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) funding in the amount of $23.344 million will fund A-Kit development, integration and test activities on multi-variant platforms.

FY 2021 RDTE Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in the amount of $2.300 million will fund System Test &amp; Evaluation (ST&amp;E) activities and software support activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The December 28, 2011, Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) authorized entry into the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, designated the program a pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), and approved the updated exit criteria.  The August 25, 2015, DAE ADM authorized entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and designated the program as a MDAP.  The EMD contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) on August 28, 2015.  The EMD contract includes priced options for Other Platform A-Kit Development, A-Kit Engineering Support, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 1 and 2 Prototypes (Hardware and Installs), LRIP 1 and 2 Engineering and Test Support, Software Technical Data Package (TDP), Navy funded requirements, and Defense Exportability Features (DEF).  CIRCM MS C was approved September 14, 2018, the LRIP and Engineering Support options were exercised and the program entered the Production &amp; Deployment phase with First Unit Equipped (FUE) planned for third quarter of FY 2020, and a Full Rate Production Decision Review (FRPDR) planned for the third quarter of FY 2020.

Due to the urgency of addressing the Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) issues related to the Phase 2a JUONS SO-0010 DoN LAIRCM initial materiel solution, the Army approved a Directed Requirement for the Phase 3 ATW/CIRCM QRC (requirement updated in November 2018). The updated requirements extend the utilization of ATW DoN LAIRCM on conventional Army aircraft and cancel the need for the ATW/CIRCM QRC system for the conventional Army. (It should be noted that the updated requirement maintains the need for ATW/CIRCM on the Special Operations aircraft.) As a result, the Army will no longer acquire the ATW sensors for use in Phase 3 of the JUONS effort. Instead, the Army accelerated the procurement of the CIRCM QRC systems for use with the currently fielded Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) in preparation for transition to the Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) system when available.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Man-Portable Radiological Detection System (MRDS) capability will provide increased radiological and nuclear (RN) detection, localization, presumptive identification and field-confirmatory identification capabilities that are networked to provide situational awareness at the tactical level. The MRDS will support Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Interdiction and Elimination operations, specifically RN Sensitive Site Assessments and Sensitive Site Exploitation. The MRDS program will replace low density legacy COTS equipment while providing new equipment to much of the Chemical Biological RN (CBRN) force.  The Joint Personal Dosimeter (JPD-I) is intended to replace Army's legacy dosimeters (Army's PDR-75A reader with the DT-236 watch). The JPD-I will provide a sensor to record and retrieve a Service member's radiation exposure from occupational to tactical levels. Future capability may also support Reconnaissance and Surveillance across the full range of CWMD operations. This capability supports Radiological and Nuclear Interdiction (RNI) and Weapons of Mass Destruction - Elimination (WMD-E) operations to: systematically locate, secure, characterize, and disable WMD programs and related capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Man-portable Radiological Detection System is a single step acquisition strategy starting at Milestone C to acquire Commercial-Off-The-Shelf equipment sets consisting of a Hands-Free search device, a Hand-Held Radioisotope Identification Device, an integrated tactical radio network, and a Situational Awareness tool in order to provide specialized Army units with a net-ready, rugged, and reliable system that can detect, identify, and characterize designated radionuclides and transmit that information securely to tactical, operational, and strategic command levels in near-real time. The contract approach will be a full and open fixed price contract for LRIP systems to support post Milestone C testing, and an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity fixed price contract for the full rate production task order.  The level of technological maturity is such that MRDS entered the acquisition cycle from MDD at MS C (FY 2018). The program is working toward a Full Rate Production Decision in 4th Qtr of FY 2020 concurrent with a Full Rate Production Contract Award.

The Joint Personal Dosimeter - Individual (JPD-I) Program Office (PO) will leverage the Navy's market research, testing and down select to meet the Army's requirements.  The level of technological maturity is such that JPD-I entered the acquisition cycle from MDD at MS C (FY 2018).  A Full Rate Production Decision in 1st Qtr of FY 2019 was made concurrent with a Full Rate Production Contract Award.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicles (NBCRV) Sensor Suite Upgrade (SSU) provides maneuver formations the ability to conduct mounted reconnaissance and surveillance missions of CBRN named areas of interest (NAIs).  The NBCRV SSU will answer the commander's priority intelligence requirements (PIR), and facilitate proactive risk-based decisions to ensure freedom of action and survivability.  A modern and capable NBCRV SSU is a critical component for Joint Force success when operating in the complex CBRN environment.  Operating with combat vehicles fighting against increasingly capable and determined enemies requires like capability with regard to protection, mobility, and lethality.  The NBCRV SSU will accomplish this by integrating the capability for command and control of unmanned systems with CBRN payload.  The NBCRV SSU will provide a CBRN detection, tipping and queueing to accomplish desired standoff distances to keep the warfighter out of harm's way and reduce sustainment costs over the current system.  A Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuver speed when conducting NBC missions and increase reliability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite Upgrade (NBCRV SSU) is an upgrade for the Stryker NBCRV.  The acquisition strategy for the Stryker NBCRV SSU is to integrate mature sensors into the Stryker NBCRV in FY 2019 for demonstration in Joint Warfighting Assessment (JWA) 19 and system level testing.  Following the testing and demonstration, the hardware and software will be fixed and updated for demonstration in JWA 20 and test in FY 2020.  An In Progress Review will be held in late FY 2022 to execute a Modification Work Order for fielding in FY 2023.  This schedule was accelerated from the previous schedule based on the maturity of the sensor and guidance from the Chief of Staff of the Army.  The NBCRV SSU program will conduct system level testing in FY 2021 using Defense Wide funding after the Modification Work Order In Process Review to ensure system performance.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

- Cyber SU provides tactical commanders at Brigade to Army Service Component Command (ASCC) with a broad understanding of Cyber Electromagnetic Activity (CEMA) threats by informing the commander of any cyber related impacts to physical domains, unified land operations, and the overall mission. Cyber SU allows for the visualization and understanding of physical (geographical), logical (at a specific network internet protocol), and cyber persona layers (bad actors, from individuals to nation states) of cyberspace. This is based on data/information from multiple sources and sensors that produce a CEMA overlay on the commander's Common Operational Picture (COP) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE). Supporting CEMA, Cyber SU synchronizes and integrates blue (friendly) cyberspace data, red (enemy), and grey (commercial/private sector), and enables collaboration at the tactical echelon. (PEO C3T)

655041EV5:
- Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI) is a software-only program, which consists of pre-configured DCO tools residing on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI). The TDI capability will reside within the Command Post at echelon Corps through Brigade for both organic Cyber Network Defenders as well as remote access by Cyber Protection teams (CPT) to support defense of the Tactical Network. (PEO C3T)

- Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) consists of platform and software programs which are key elements of the DCO Maneuver Baseline infrastructure, platform, and tools. The employment of defensive capabilities creates specific effects in cyberspace through actions that allow commanders to achieve the following objectives: deter, destroy, and defeat enemy offensive cyberspace operations; gain time; economy of force; control key terrain; protect tasked critical assets and infrastructure; and develop intelligence. DCO supports the Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER), Army Cyberspace Operations and Integration Center (ACOIC), (5) Regional Cyber Centers (RCCs), Cyber Warfare Battalion (CWB), Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF), Cyber Protection Brigade (CPB), and (41) Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) in COMPO 1/2/3. (PEO EIS)

- ARCYBER Rapid Cyber Prototyping provides capabilities that can quickly respond to emerging cyber threats and keep up with threat technology. ARCYBER identifies potential development and prototyping efforts via Cyber Needs Forms (CNFs) based on operational feedback, changes in tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs), and trends of adversarial activity. These are separate and distinct from DCO programs identified and are used to rapidly address a network threat/vulnerability. (ARCYBER)</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Cyber SU is a software-only program hosted on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) at Brigade to ASCC echelons continually integrating Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) capabilities into the Common Operating Environment (COE) to produce a Cyber Electromagnetic Activity (CEMA) overlay on the commander's Common Operational Picture (COP) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE). Cyber SU enables the commander and staff to concurrently defend the network/information systems, identify and target cyberspace threats, manage risks and aid in increasing operational success.

Cyber SU will allow the tactical commander to see themselves, see their battlespace and understand their battlespace; this will be accomplished with three capability drops. Cyber SU provides the visualization and understanding of physical (geographical), logical (at a specific network internet protocol), and cyber persona layers (bad actors, from individuals to nation states) of tactical cyberspace data. Cyber SU ingests existing data sources, synchronizing and integrating blue (signal, cyberspace (DCO), electronic warfare and mission command data), red (intelligence data), and grey (commercial/private sector data) and enables collaboration at the tactical edge. Cyber SU provides tactical commanders with a thorough understanding of CEMA threats by informing the commander of any cyber related impacts to physical domains, unified land operations, and the overall mission.

Cyber SU FY 2021 funding will support continued prototyping, engineering, testing, training development and program management to establish the Cyber SU initial capability in support of First Unit Equipped (FUE) 1Q22. The initial COTS/NDI system will be integrated into CPCE, and will ingest, correlate, analyze and display cyberspace data to include network health and status into useful and actionable warfighter information that can be shared with the CEMA Work Group.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Cyber SU IS ICD was approved on 9 Mar 18 by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and on 4 Feb 19 by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC). The Requirements Definition Package (RDP) was approved on 19 Mar 19 by the AROC Requirements Board. The Cyber SU program is under an IT Box construct with a five (5) year term (FY20-24) which aligns with the current RDP.

The Program Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), approved the Materiel Development Decision on 20 Jun 18, designating Cyber SU as an ACAT III AIS program. The program is currently scheduled for a Milestone B decision review 2Q20.

The program is employing a tailored acquisition model for Agile Software Development, under which Cyber SU will develop a series of testable, integrated subsets of capability to meet the overall full functional values of the RDP through the use of Capability Drops (CDs). Subsequent CDs are to be approved by the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence in collaboration with U.S. Army Forces Command. To that end, the program office intends to evaluate and leverage COTS/NDI products to the greatest extent and leverage cyber solutions from science and technology efforts (e.g., Cyber Mission Impact Tool (CMIT), as well as ingest data from related programs (e.g, DCO, TDI, CPCE, EWPMT, UNO, DCGS-A). Prototyping and development will employ a combination of Government entities and commercial vendors via an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contract vehicle. Coordination and integration with complimentary programs and systems (sources of cyber data feeds) will be an integral part of the program to ensure the data is made available to be consumed by the Cyber SU solution. Cyber SU will be hosted on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and will be fielded by the CPCE/TSI program in accordance with their fielding schedule.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The TDI capability will reside within the Command Post at echelon Corps through Brigade for both organic Cyber Network Defenders as well as remote access by Cyber Protection teams (CPT) to support defense of the Tactical Network.

- Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) consists of platform and software programs which are key elements of the DCO Maneuver Baseline infrastructure, platform, and tools. The employment of defensive capabilities creates specific effects in cyberspace through actions that allow commanders to achieve the following objectives: deter, destroy, and defeat enemy offensive cyberspace operations; gain time; economy of force; control key terrain; protect tasked critical assets and infrastructure; and develop intelligence. DCO supports the Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER), Army Cyberspace Operations and Integration Center (ACOIC), (5) Regional Cyber Centers (RCCs), Cyber Warfare Battalion (CWB), Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF), Cyber Protection Brigade (CPB), and (41) Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) in COMPO 1/2/3.

- ARCYBER Rapid Cyber Prototyping provides capabilities that can quickly respond to emerging cyber threats and keep up with threat technology. ARCYBER identifies potential development and prototyping efforts via Cyber Needs Forms (CNFs) based on operational feedback, changes in tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs), and trends of adversarial activity. These are separate and distinct from DCO programs identified and are used to rapidly address a network threat/vulnerability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

OMA SAG 432612 for DCO License Renewals and non-traditional sustainment for FY19-20. Funds were aligned to SAG 151251 in FY21 (transferred to BA8 Software RDTE Appropriation Pilot Program PE 0608041A Project CD1).
OMA SAG 435106 for Civilian Pay was established by the Army starting in FY19 due to Reimbursable to Direct conversion for DCO.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCO Information System Capabilities Development Document (IS ICD) was approved on 19 Dec 17 by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC). DCO programs are under an IT Box construct with five year term (FY18-22) which aligns with current Requirements Definition Package (RDP).

The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), approved the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 13 Apr 18, designating Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI) as an ACAT III program. The TDI program's RDP was approved on 8 Nov 18 by the Army Requirement Board (ARB). Under subsequent reviews, the MDA approved a tailored defense unique software intensive acquisition approach for TDI. To support this agile acquisition approach, the TDI program office will develop and deploy pre-configured software in a series of capability drops in order to deliver full functional values of the RDP that align with DCO priorities. The TDI program had a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) of TDI's initial capability approved by the MDA on Sep 19, which allowed the program to achieve IOC Oct 19. TDI is hosted on the Tactical
Server Infrastructure (TSI) and will be fielded by the CPCE/TSI program in accordance with their fielding schedule. Execution of the TDI program will be a combination of government entities and commercial vendors.

The ARB approved Cyber Analytics and DCO Tool Suite RDPs on 24 Apr 18; Mission Planning on 26 Jun 18; and User Activity Monitoring and Forensics and Malware on 16 Oct 18. The MDA designated these as ACAT IV programs. Under subsequent reviews, the MDA approved agile acquisition approach to develop and deliver preconfigured software in a series of releases and capability drops in order to deliver full functional values of the RDP that align with DCO priorities. DCO programs utilize standard and 874 agile pilot evolutionary acquisition processes (30-90 rapid acquisition approach). DCO continually delivers new technologies and capabilities as a prototype and fields updated capabilities. DCO contract strategy utilizes multiple existing contracts vehicles to include Other Transactional Authority (OTA), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)-based, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), and Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding line is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

FY 2021 RDT&amp;E resources are required to purchase mature production representative prototype components for operational demonstration evaluations, testing, and Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) characterization in support of Capability Set 23 in accordance with the Army approved ITN Abbreviated-Capability Development Document (A-CDD). 

The Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program is a single Acquisition Category IC program encompassing: handheld radios (one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR),  two-channel Leader Radio (LR), and single-channel data radio) and Manpack (MP) radio (Generation 1 and Generation 2 radios). HMS provides voice and data communication to the expeditionary Warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS)/Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radio systems are software reprogrammable, networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communication. HMS radios will support a variety of other platforms, including tactical End User Devices (EUD) voice and data needs. HMS provides tailorable and scalable, software-defined radio systems meeting U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs.

Tactical Network Radio Systems (Low-Tier) provide both Classified and Unclassified communications. The radios provide the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) legacy waveform for Classified and Unclassified communications. They also provide advanced waveforms (e.g. TrellisWare TSM) that provide Secure but Unclassified (SBU) communications. The MP radio provides the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) waveform for Tactical Satellite communications. The HMS program is currently in the process of conducting significant testing, including Laboratory and Field Based Risk Reduction events in support of an Operational Test event. 

The HMS radio systems serve as the backbone of the ITN architecture, supporting a converged Mission Command network. This funding supports ITN testing and evaluation, of which HMS is a key component. The Army intends to test and integrate two-channel communication technologies, utilizing existing Army two-channel radio variants (MP Radios), in support of Air to Ground. A single-channel variant that runs an advanced networking waveform and Small Form Factors will be evaluated as part of the ITN as an affordable option to reduce size, weight, and power. This RDTE 6.5 funding line will involve mature system development, integration, and demonstration in support of ITN evaluation to include: concept refinement, characterization, data collection, demos, integrated testing, and operational assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Manpack's Test and Evaluation focuses on the key technical and operational characteristics of the system: Radio Frequency performance, security, Reliability, Availability &amp; Maintainability, suitability and survivability requirements, in addition to operational environmental performance requirements as per the Capability Production Document. All radios awarded a contract were required to go through the Qualification Test (QT) to qualify for a Customer Test (CT). Following CT there was a Sandbox, Soldier Feedback Study, and Field / Lab Based Risk Reduction (FBRR/LBRR) that serve as risk reduction events prior to Operational Test (OT) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers. The OT will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary / Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The OT will be designed to validate that HMS products meet warfighter needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment. Results from OT will facilitate the delivery orders for Full Rate Production.

HMS also supports ITN's iterative evaluation and capability implementation strategy.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MP Radio is currently executing a May 2014 approved acquisition strategy to procure Non-Developmental Items (NDI). Utilizing a full and open competition strategy, the MP base contract was awarded to all potential industry partners. The MP contract was awarded on 26 February 2016, and procures NDI MP radios for use in a classified environment.  As laid out in the Acquisition Strategy, these candidate NDI radios will need to demonstrate through testing, compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; to obtain material release for Full Rate Production (FRP).  The MP is currently capable of running the following waveforms: Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) - Army managed waveforms, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) - Navy managed waveform, and other advanced networking waveforms. 

The Army will procure radios through a multiple step selection process:
a. Awarded FFP Contracts to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (26 February 2016)
b. Awarded initial delivery orders based on Qualification Test results (19 December 2016)
c. Awarded second delivery orders based on Customer Test results (31 July 2017)
d. Award(ed) LRIP delivery orders (30 April 2018, 06 June 2019, and 3QFY20)
e. Achieve Full Rate Production (2QFY21)</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding line is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

FY 2021 RDT&amp;E resources are required to purchase mature production representative prototype components for evaluation (lab and field based risk reduction events), testing, and Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) characterization in support of Capability Set 23 in accordance with the Army approved ITN Abbreviated-Capability Development Document (A-CDD). 

The HMS handheld radios include the one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR), two-channel Leader Radio (LR), and single-channel data radio. Handheld radios provide voice/data communication to the expeditionary Warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS)/Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. Handheld radio systems are software reprogrammable, networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communication (RR/LR). Handheld radios will support a variety of other platforms, including tactical End User Devices (EUD) voice and data needs. HMS provides tailorable and scalable, software-defined radio systems meeting U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs. 

Handheld radios provide both Classified and Unclassified communications. Handheld radios provide the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) legacy waveform for Classified and Unclassified communications. Handheld radios also provide advanced waveforms (e.g. TrellisWare TSM) that provide Secure but Unclassified (SBU) communications. The HMS program is currently in the process of conducting significant tests including Laboratory and Field Based Risk Reduction events in support of an Operational Test event. 

The HMS radio systems serve as the backbone of the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) architecture, supporting a converged Mission Command network. This funding supports ITN testing and evaluation, of which HMS is a key component. A single-channel variant that runs an advanced networking waveform and Small Form Factors will be evaluated as part of the ITN as an affordable option to reduce size, weight, and power. This RDTE 6.5 funding line will involve mature system development, integration, and demonstration in support of ITN evaluation to include: concept refinement, characterization, data collection, demos, integrated testing, and operational assessments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

All radios awarded a contract will be required to go through the Qualification Test (QT) to qualify for Field Based Army Evaluation Center (AEC) Evaluation/Lab Based Risk Reduction (FBAE/LBRR) that will serve as risk reduction events prior to Operational Test (OT) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers. The OT will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary / Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The OT will be designed to validate that the HMS products meet warfighter needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment. Results from the OT will facilitate the delivery orders for Full Rate Production.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 13 September 2016 the Army Acquisition Executive approved a decrease to the Basis of Issue (BOI) for the single channel RR, increase the BOI for the two channel LR and move forward with acquisition activities for the two channel LR. An acquisition strategy addendum adding LR was approved in March 2017. The addendum continued the multi-vendor approach utilizing the existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) RR base contract (awarded 29 April 2015) to on-ramp LR capabilities (18 September 2018). The LR effort is a separate competition under the Handheld radio suite.  As laid out in the acquisition strategy, these candidate non-developmental radios will need to demonstrate through testing, compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; to obtain material release for Full Rate Production (FRP).  

The LR will simultaneously run Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) and other advanced networking waveforms, in one radio with both handheld and mounted configurations, for fixed and mobile sites.

The Army will procure radios through a multiple step selection process:
a. Awarded FFP Contracts to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (18 September 2018)
b. Awarded LRIP delivery orders to support SFAB and ITN fieldings/evaluations (18 September 2018)
c. Award LRIP delivery orders based on results of the best value trade-off construct (2QFY20 &amp; 4QFY20)
d. Achieve Full Rate Production (2QFY21)</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Contract Writing System (ACWS) will be the Army's single, next-generation, enterprise-wide contract writing, management, execution, and close-out software system. ACWS will facilitate the standardization of Army Procurement business processes and streamline the integration with Army Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. As a financial feeder system, ACWS will meet the compliance requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996. The system will meet the full scope of Army contracting requirements, including those in secure and non-secure locations, those supporting combat or non-combat contingencies, those within or outside the borders of the Continental United States, those supporting grants and assistance agreements, and those performing weapons systems, construction, installation, and other specialized contracting activities. This is consistent with initial DoD guidance 21 October 2011, which directed the Services to develop a new contract writing system.  Since awarding a contract to CGI Federal Inc. on 22 May 2017, the program completed risk reduction that aligned Army's business processes to the selected commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product, and reduced unnecessary requirements and interfaces.  The program conducted a successful Baseline Authority to Proceed (ATP) decision on 18 August 2018, and obtained the Army Acquisition Executive's approval to award initial development task order. ACWS is on track to deploy a Minimum Viable Solution (MVS) to two pilot units during FY 2020, and achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) NLT 4QFY2020. If the full capability is not fully deployed by the end of FY 2023, the Army will incur the full SPS bill ($14M+/ year).  ACWS will also enable the decommission of the Procurement Automated Data and Document System (PADDS) and Virtual Contracting Enterprise (VCE) systems.

ACWS was approved by The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD (A&amp;S)) as a pilot program supporting the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 873 Agile Pilots. The ACWS Agile 873 pilot Realignment Plan was approved 2QFY2019 and cites duration of the Program as five years through Full Deployment. As part of the Sec 873 activities ACWS is realigning and restructuring prior to the Full Deployment (FD) to include a contract structure that enables Agile best practices and incremental capability delivery to the field. ACWS will support OSD requirements to quickly identify Agile development lessons learned, reduce procedural delays, improve policy, and enhance workforce training.  Sec 873 Pilot Programs are intended to provide programs the opportunity to restructure in order to streamline contract and acquisition approaches, and tear down barriers to agile development without penalty. The process allows the Army ability to analyze and prioritize requirements to enable deployable product on demand, the cadence and content of system documentation and programmatic reviews, and a transparent culture in a blended government-system integrator team. ACWS participates in the 873 Community of Practice (CoP), sharing and utilizing lessons learned, shaping agile policy, processes, and tools for DoD.  

During FY 2020, ACWS will coordinate with the Navy's eProcurement System (ePS) team to identify and implement efficiencies; the two teams will continue implementing those plans during FY 2021, including using combined buying power for potential economies of scale for license purchases.

FY 2021 RDTE Funding will support the development of Full Deployment (FD) functionality of ACWS. ACWS will continue/initiate development of capabilities including integration with the Logistics Modernization Program (LMP), important contracting functions to manage complex weapons procurements, and other key system interfaces and functionality. Business system interfaces will be developed with these key partners to complete system development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The original ACWS schedule showed two major software releases to deliver the Army Contract Writing capability and retire three legacy contract writing systems/ tools by FY2023 (SPS/ PADDS/ VCE).  ACWS changed its schedule and approach in July 2018 to better align with its funding profile and the outcome of POM20-24. Adjusting to this funding profile, ACWS revised their schedule to deliver three incremental capabilities (Minimal Viable Solution [MVS], Initial Operating Capability [IOC], and Full Deployment [FD]).  These changes, coupled with the risk reduction task order resulting in refined requirements, drive the increase in FY2021.  The President's FY2020 budget marks ACWS by $2.6 million.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Through full and open competition, ACWS awarded a Single Award ID/IQ contract with a 10-year ordering period to CGI Federal Inc. on 22 May 2017. Task Order 0001 of this contract conducted risk reduction activities concurrent with development of regulatory and statutory documentation requirements. These activities were conducted for the purpose of meeting the OSD goals to sunset Standard Procurement System (SPS) in FY 2023. Risk reduction activities include Business Process Reengineering, Global Analysis, Blueprinting, Role Design, and Interface Definition. Following risk reduction, ACWS baselined the program at the IOC Authorization to Proceed (ATP), and developed initial software release interfaces (part of the Minimum Viable Solution release). Task Order 0002 was issued in August 2018 for the design, development, and testing of the Minimum Viable Solution and Initial Operational Capability releases.  Task Order 0003 was issued for the purpose of acquiring and maintaining user licenses.  During FY 2020, ACWS plans to issue the next Task Order for Deployment and Fielding of the solution through FY 2021.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Survivability Development budget line includes funding to support the development and integration of Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) products onto Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) aircraft variants and future platforms.

The Aircraft Survivability Development program includes Projects titled Aircraft Survivability Equipment Development (ER7) and Common Missile Warning System (ER8). This program also includes funding for Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) SO-0010 Phase 2a, Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Directed Requirement for Advanced Threat Warner (ATW) portion of Phase 3 ATW/Common Infrared Countermeasures Quick Reaction Capability (ATW/CIRCM QRC), and Limited Interim Missile Warning System Quick Reaction Capability (LIMWS QRC).

ER7: Aircraft Survivability Development.
The objective of the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Development project is to improve Radio Frequency (RF) ASE for Army Aviation. APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) detects, categorizes, and prioritizes RF emitters and provides a visual / aural alert to aircrew members warning them of targeting by RF-guided weapons. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward. 

Phase 1, APR-39C(V)1/4, serves as an obsolescence / sustainment upgrade to the Processor Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) for AN/APR-39A(V) Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) implemented to ensure that the currently fielded system remains viable until affordable improved RF ASE capability can be pursued in Phases 2 and 3.

Phase 2A is RWR Modernization begins by adopting the United States Navy APR-39D(V)2 system. APR-39D(V)2 will significantly improve the RF threat coverage, automatic detection and identification of threat types, bearing, and lethality. Phase 2B, APR-39E(V)2, Modernized Radar Warning Receiver (MRWR), is an Army Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to APR-39D(V)2, approved in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed June 24, 2019, by Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare &amp; Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S). This ECP will implement enhanced hardware and software upgrades to keep APR-39 technically relevant against new and emerging agile threats. 

Phase 3 adds active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability for selected aircraft; Material Development Decision (MDD) for this ECM capability phase is planned for 4 Quarter (Q) Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.

Justification: FY 2021 Base Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding of $32.338 million supports APR-39E(V)2 hardware and software system development, prototyping, platform integration, initial system government qualification and performance testing.

ER8: Common Missile Warning System (CMWS).
The CMWS program is a missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming Inrared (IR)-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification, unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification, false alarm rejection, and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives ultraviolet (UV) missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS), which detect UV signals, and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures, including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM)-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding materiel release conditions and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats.

The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, cables, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.

As a part of Phase 2a of the JUONS (SO-0010) program, the Army integrated the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system onto the Army and Special Operations Aircraft (SOA) platforms.  Due to a number of challenges, circumstances, and variables, the Army updated the Advanced Threat Warning/CIRCM QRC and Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) Directed Requirements (dated November 16, 2018).  The updated requirements extend the utilization of ATW DoN LAIRCM on conventional Army aircraft and cancel the need for the ATW/CIRCM QRC system for the conventional Army.  (It should be noted that the updated requirement maintains the need for ATW/CIRCM on the Special Operations aircraft.)  As a result, the Army did not acquire the ATW sensors for use in Phase 3 of the JUONS effort.  Instead, the Army accelerated the procurement of the CIRCM QRC systems for use with the currently fielded CMWS in preparation for transition to the LIMWS system when available.

Phase 4 LIMWS QRC addressess the HQDA Directed Requirement to provide a greater capability than the current Program of Record (POR), CMWS, to bridge the gap between CMWS and the future POR.  LIMWS is required in order to maintain overmatch of quickly emerging threat technology and tactics by providing increased detection range, improved detection in clutter, more agile algorithms to rapidly respond to emerging threats, and eliminates the need for sensor alignments.

Justification:
CMWS: FY 2021 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $3.589 million funds Future Sensor and Algorithm Analysis, Threat and Vulnerability Analysis, and Systems Engineering Program Management (SEPM).

Phase 4 LIMWS QRC: FY 2021 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount of $64.625 million funds development, engineering support and test of platform integration hardware and software for Army and Special Operations aircraft.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aircraft Survivability Equipment Development budget line includes funding to support the development and integration of Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) products onto Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) aircraft variants and future platforms.

The objective of the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Development project is to improve Radio Frequency (RF) ASE for Army aviation. APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) detects, categorizes, and prioritizes RF emitters and provides a visual / aural alert to aircrew members warning them of targeting by RF-guided weapons. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward. 

Phase 1, APR-39C(V)1/4,  serves as an obsolescence / sustainment upgrade to the Processor Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) of APR-39A(V) Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) implemented to ensure that the currently fielded system remains viable until affordable improved RF ASE capability can be pursued in Phases 2 and 3. 

Phase 2A is RWR Modernization begins by adopting the United States Navy APR-39D(V)2 system. APR-39D(V)2 will significantly improve the RF threat coverage, automatic detection and identification of threat types, bearing, and lethality. Phase 2B, the APR-39E(V)2, Modernized Radar Warning Receiver (MRWR), is an Army Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to APR-39D(V)2, approved in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed June 24, 2019, by Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare &amp; Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S). This ECP will implement enhanced hardware and software upgrades to keep APR-39 technically relevant against new and emerging agile threats. 

Phase 3 adds active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability for selected aircraft; Material Development Decision (MDD) for this ECM capability phase is planned for 4 Quarter (Q) Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.

Justification:  FY 2021 Base Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding of $32.338 million supports APR-39E(V)2 hardware and software system development, prototyping, platform integration, initial system government qualification, and performance testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Radio Frequency (RF) ASE is managed by Project Manager ASE (PM ASE) for development, testing, procurement, integration and installation on Army rotary wing and fixed wing Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA) aviation platforms. PM ASE proposed a three-phased path forward commensurate with user priorities and affordability considerations. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward.

Phase 1,  APR-39C(V)1/4,  addresses obsolescence/Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues associated with the currently fielded AN/APR-39A(V) Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) via sole source Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) awarded to the APR-39A(V) manufacturer.

Phase 2A is RWR Modernization begins by adopting the United States Navy APR-39D(V)2 system. APR-39D(V)2 will significantly improve the RF threat coverage, automatic detection and identification of threat types, bearing, and lethality. Phase 2B, APR-39E(V)2, Modernized Radar Warning Receiver (MRWR), is an Army Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to APR-39D(V)2, approved in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed June 24, 2019, by PEO IEW&amp;S. This ECP will implement enhanced hardware and software upgrades to keep APR-39 technically relevant against new and emerging agile threats. 

Phase 3 will develop and integrate active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability for selected aircraft; Material Development Decision (MDD) for this ECM capability phase is planned for 4Q FY 2020.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) budget line includes funding to support the development and integration of Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) products onto Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) aircraft variants and future platforms.

The CMWS program is a missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming Inrared (IR)-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification, unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification, false alarm rejection, and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives ultraviolet (UV) missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS), which detect UV signals, and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures, including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM)-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition, the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding materiel release conditions and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats.

The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, cables, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.

As a part of Phase 2a of the JUONS (SO-0010) program, the Army integrated the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system onto the Army and Special Operations Aircraft (SOA) platforms.  Due to a number of challenges, circumstances, and variables, the Army updated the Advanced Threat Warning/CIRCM QRC and Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) Directed Requirements (dated November 16, 2018).  The updated requirements extend the utilization of ATW DoN LAIRCM on conventional Army aircraft and cancel the need for the ATW/CIRCM QRC system for the conventional Army.  (It should be noted that the updated requirement maintains the need for ATW/CIRCM on the Special Operations aircraft.)  As a result, the Army did not acquire the ATW sensors for use in Phase 3 of the JUONS effort.  Instead, the Army accelerated the procurement of the CIRCM QRC systems for use with the currently fielded CMWS in preparation for transition to the LIMWS system when available.

Phase 4 LIMWS QRC addresses the HQDA Directed Requirement to provide a greater capability than the current Program of Record (POR), CMWS, to bridge the gap between CMWS and the future POR.  LIMWS is required in order to maintain overmatch of quickly emerging threat technology and tactics by providing increased detection range, improved detection in clutter, more agile algorithms to rapidly respond to emerging threats, and eliminates the need for sensor alignments.

CMWS: Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $3.589 million will fund development engineering of Threat and Vulnerability Analysis, Future Sensor and Algorithm Analysis, and Systems Engineering Project Management (SEPM). 

Phase 4 LIMWS: FY 2021 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount of $64.625 million are required to fund development, engineering support, and test of platform integration hardware and software for Army and Special Operations aircraft.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CMWS: Procurement of US Government CMWS A-Kit and B-Kits are complete.  CMWS is managed as Mission Equipment for deploying units and fielded as directed by Army G-3/5/7.  The CMWS program will continue to be supported through a five year services-only Cost Plus Fixed Fee or Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract, with services to begin by September 2019.

Phase 2a JUONS DoN LAIRCM and  Phase 3 CIRCM QRC: JUONS S0-0010 acquisition strategy includes aircraft prime contractor engineering support contracted to a Government test organization. Aircraft integration for JUONS will be handled through government operated organizations and industry partners.

Phase 4 LIMWS QRC: Acquisition strategy included a full and open competition for selection of prime vendor for development of B-Kit and development of A-Kit and support testing for the lead program. Additional platform A-Kit development will be handled by government organizations and industry partners.

Threat and Vulnerability Analysis combines the same efforts as Vulnerability Analysis and Assessment of Technologies (VAAT) and Threat Analysis Database (TAD).  Results from threat and vulnerability analysis efforts will be used to determine if an algorithm update is required to maintain missile warning threat overmatch and provide input to improve US Government authoritative threat modeling updates. 

Future Sensor Algorithm Analysis is critically important because this program element supports the entire Missile Warning portfolio. Future sensor algorithm analysis and development equally supports MANPADS and Hostile Fire overmatch.

CMWS Systems Engineering Program Management is necessary due to the nature of emerging and current threat(s). Threat(s) analyses include, when required, collaboration support with intelligence organizations, course of action planning, root cause investigations, threat and laboratory hardware maintenance, and lab tools upgrade to support specific performance analyses.

Develop Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) models of CMWS and LIMWS which will align to Program Executive Office Aviation (PEO AVN) system engineering models that will be used to support integration of ASE products onto Future Vertical Lift Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) and Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) aircraft variants.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) will provide a ground-based weapon system designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats. The IFPC Inc 2 system consists of a launcher and interceptor integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture, IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS), and the Sentinel sensor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission. The Objective counter-RAM mission employs both alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. 

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, the Army evaluated alternative strategies to address an Army interim CM defense (CMD) capability at critical strategic fixed site locations while continuing the development of an IFPC capability.  On 5 December 2019, the Army signed a contract with the Israeli Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) for two Interim CMD (Iron Dome) Batteries. For each of the interim capability's Iron Dome Batteries, the Army intends to employ a configuration that matches the Israeli Firing Unit.

The IFPC Inc 2 program will conduct Iron Dome experimentation to determine the ability of the two standalone interim CMD Iron Dome Batteries to interoperate with the US Army's Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture including the Army's IBCS command and control (C2) network. 

Concurrently with the Interim CMD assessment, the Army will develop a launcher and interceptor solution that is integrated with the IBCS and the Sentinel sensor. The Army's decision for the IFPC Inc 2 capability will decide between an U.S. industry-based CMD launcher/interceptor and a componentized Iron Dome launcher/TAMIR-class interceptor. The Army will utilize a tailored acquisition approach to evaluate new capability and provide residual operational capability in FY 2023 and then transition into procurement and field by FY 2025.
 
FY 2021 Base dollars in the amount of $235.770 million are designated for experimentation with the interim CM capability and the development and integration of the IFPC Inc 2 system.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) will provide a ground-based weapon system designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats. The IFPC Inc 2 system consists of a launcher and interceptor integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture, IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS), and the Sentinel sensor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission. The Objective counter-RAM mission employs both alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. 

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, the Army evaluated alternative strategies to address an Army interim CM defense (CMD) capability at critical strategic fixed site locations while continuing the development of an IFPC capability.  On 5 December 2019, the Army signed a contract with the Israeli Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) for two Interim CMD (Iron Dome) Batteries. For each of the interim capability's Iron Dome Batteries, the Army intends to employ a configuration that matches the Israeli Firing Unit.

The IFPC Inc 2 program will conduct Iron Dome experimentation to determine the ability of the two standalone interim CMD Iron Dome Batteries to interoperate with the US Army's Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture including the Army's IBCS command and control (C2) network. 

Concurrently with the Interim CMD assessment, the Army will develop a launcher and interceptor solution that is integrated with the IBCS and the Sentinel sensor. The Army's decision for the IFPC Inc 2 capability will decide between an U.S. industry-based CMD launcher/interceptor and a componentized Iron Dome launcher/TAMIR-class interceptor. The Army will utilize a tailored acquisition approach to evaluate new capability and provide residual operational capability in FY 2023 and then transition into procurement and field by FY 2025.
 
FY 2021 Base dollars in the amount of $235.770 million are designated for the development and integration of the IFPC Inc 2 system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This program is an integral part of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) architecture.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>As reported in Oct 2018, the Army will rapidly field an Interim CMD capability with the Israeli Iron Dome.  Concurrently, the Army will integrate an IFPC capability of a launcher and interceptor leveraging the AIAMD open systems architecture and IBCS as the Fire Control component, and US sensor (Sentinel).  

The Army approved a Directed Requirement to initiate procurement of the Israeli Iron Dome Missile System for an Interim IFPC CMD capability on 9 Feb 2019. Congress approved ATR actions to align IFPC FY 2018 and 2019 Procurement to fund the Interim CMD (Iron Dome) purchase and to repurpose the FY 2019 RDTE funds in May 2019. 

To support the Interim CMD requirement, the Army has signed a 10 U.S. Code, paragraph 2373 procurement contract: two interim Iron Dome batteries for technical evaluation, assessment of operational utility, and safety evaluation. Additionally, the IFPC program will perform logistics analysis and assessments to determine Iron Dome training requirements, fielding requirement, spares packages, maintenance policies, and required Operational and Maintenance documentation.  In FY 2020, IFPC will continue its logistics assessments, Modeling and Simulation analysis, and integration activities, as well as conduct Performance Analysis and Testing of the Interim IFPC solution at White Sands Missile Range prior to their deployment for operational assessment. 

In support of the IFPC solution, the Army utilized the Department of Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) OTA process to request proposals for technology readiness assessments on launcher alternatives in FY 2019. Additionally, the Army verified technology readiness of interceptor alternatives in FY 2018. These actions will inform the IFPC materiel solution decision. The Army will utilize a tailored acquisition approach to evaluate new capability and provide residual operational capability in FY 2023 and then transition into procurement and field by FY 2025.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element supports modernization of the current Ground Robotic fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Robotic Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.

FB2: The Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) Inc. II is the Army's Soldier transportable, remotely operated, medium size (&lt;= 164 lbs.) common robotic system. The system utilizes both radio and tethered communications allowing dismounted Soldiers to perform hazardous missions from a safe standoff distance. The MTRS Inc. II system consists of an Operator Control Unit (OCU), a suite of various mission payloads, and a mobility platform. Open architecture and the Ground Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) Interoperability Profile (IOP) requirements are employed to reduce obsolescence risks and to maximize efficiency in acquiring future capabilities. MTRS Inc. II will support current and future payload missions for the Engineer's route clearance platoons, Special Operational Forces (SOF) detachments, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Units.
FB2 does not have any funding in FY 2021.

FB3: Robotic Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts. It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interfaces, common software and common architecture for robotics &amp; autonomous platforms, payloads &amp; universal controllers. It will establish a Common Specifications Reference (CSR) to provide a repository codifying the Army Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) standards for open architecture, interoperability interfaces, and common control. RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET), Tactical Wheeled Vehicle-Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System Type I (RCIS Type I), Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Medium) (CRS(M)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Inc. II, Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP), Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV), etc.), new standards addressing emerging requirements and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) (i.e. Cyber Security, new autonomous behaviors &amp; artificial intelligence, new payloads, lethality, etc.). 

FY 2021 RDTE funds in the amount of $2.702 million supports the further development and finalization of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems-Ground (RAS-G) Interoperability Profile (IOP) Version 5.0. IOP V5.0 will provide the required modular open interfaces and compliance test tools for new programs including S-MET Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), LRR, CRS(M), TWV-LF, OMFV, RCV, ERP, robotic assault breacher vehicles, and robotic applique kits for manned ground systems. Additionally, FY 2021 RDTE funds will continue the development &amp; hardening of Robotic Operating System, Military (ROS-M) software modules and ROS-M instantiation documents, and management of ROS-M registry &amp; repository infrastructure.

FB4: The Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)) is the Army's small sized (&lt;25 lbs.) Soldier back-packable, remotely operated, common robotic system. The system provides dismounted Soldiers with increased standoff capability from hazardous threats. The system consists of a Universal Robotic Controller (URC), a suite of various payloads, and an open architecture common mobility platform allowing for future capability growth. The CRS(I) will allow the operator to quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and/or payloads. The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces. This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the Operating Environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated Warfighting Force by providing standoff to the Warfighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations. 

FY 2021 RDTE funding in the amount of $2.352 million will fund the development, testing and validation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), which includes contractor support required for these ECP tasks, as well as the development of Modification Work Orders (MWOs).  This funding will also fund further development of Maintainer Technical Manuals and other LOG products needed to transition to full organic sustainment under Full Materiel Release (FMR) in 4QFY21, and resolve open issues listed in the Get Well Plan to meet FMR. This funding also supports programmatic risk mitigation activities including, but not limited to: Cyber Security Controls (i.e. Risk Management Framework), commonality directives, payloads, sensors, condition based maintenance, electronics, standard interfaces and architectures, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies, Interoperability Profile (IOP), and analysis of collaborative operations with various Unmanned Systems assigned at Battalion and below in addition to any program management support costs associated with these activities.

FB6: Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) will help to reduce Soldier loads by transporting mission specific equipment, resupply equipment, and supplies required for extended operations. The S-MET will be capable of carrying the equipment currently required to support Infantry and Engineer Platoons in the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) for a 72 hour mission without resupply. The S-MET will reduce Soldier load, increase squad mobility during combat operations and dismounted maneuvers. S-MET will have open architectures, a remote control, support casualty evacuation, power generation/offload and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP).

FY 2021 RDTE funding in the amount of $5.008 million supports the development, integration, and procurement of Technical Insertions and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) to increase mission capabilities to requirements in the Abbreviated Capability Development Document (A-CDD). FY2021 RDTE funding supports procurement of test assets, testing, development of logistics material required to support these efforts. Program support to include travel and miscellaneous expenses in support of these RDTE efforts will also be funded.

FB7: The Robotics Enhanced Program (REP) uses a "buy/lease, try and inform" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.
FB7 does not have any funding in FY 2021.

FB8:  The Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS) is a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The SBS provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver. The system is simple to deploy and use to support the squad leader's decision-making process. The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.  Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. 
In FY 2020, this project and funding will transition to PE: 06044827A / Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem/Val project 0604827A.FK4.

FB9:  The Common Robotic System, Heavy (CRS(H)) is a modular large-sized system that provides enhanced protection to the EOD Soldier in order to support the Joint Force Commander with the ability to identify, render safe and dispose of explosive ordnance (EO) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of the Range of Military Operations (ROMO) and Home Land Defense (HLD) operations. CRS(H) will also enable EOD Soldiers to execute Defense Support of the Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations in response to requests from federal, state, local, and tribal authorities for domestic incidents, emergencies, disasters, designated law enforcement support and other activities. CRS(H) will support current and future missions for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units.
The MTRS Standardization project provides the platforms to support integration and testing of payloads and technology for non-standard unmanned ground robotics systems used by Army Engineers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) and Special Operational Forces (SOF) units. Current system characteristics include the following: a remote controlled articulated arm with a gripper, operating range up to 800 meters, multiple illuminated cameras, a pan/tilt surveillance camera, two-way radio, and a ruggedized operator control unit. The platforms provided will support development and testing of the following capabilities: High Dexterous Manipulation System (HDMS), Multi-Spectral Image Fusion System (MIFS), and Precision Aimed Multi-shot Disruptor (PAMD). The use of robotics allows the first approach, to potentially explosive hazards, to be made by a robot rather than a Soldier. 
FB9 does not have any funding in FY 2021.

FG8: The Universal Robotic Controller (URC) provides the capability to individually and/or concurrently control multiple Unmanned Systems (UxS) platforms and control/monitor a mesh network without having to obtain and/or carry separate Operator Control Unit (OCUs) for each system. A controlled UxS may be mobile or stationary, can be smart learning, and self-adaptive. Two URCs will be used to hand-off control of a system to a receiver, reducing hand-off time and the need for the UxSs to have multiple OCUs. The URC will also be capable of "hot swapping" batteries where one of its two batteries can be replaced without the system being shut down, halting mission progress, and use current or new Soldier power sources that will maximize its operational time and minimize the number of replacement batteries needed for most missions. The intent of this requirement allows the Soldier at battalion and below to use the URC to operate unmanned aerial systems (e.g. Raven, PUMA, Short Range Micro (SRM), etc.) and unmanned ground vehicles (e.g. CRS(I), CRS(V), CRS(M), CRS(H), S-MET, MTRS INC II, Light Reconnaissance (LR), Wingman, Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV), etc.) and emerging unmanned air/ground systems. The URC is defined in the Common Robotic System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Capability Development Document (CDD) and is included in the CRS(I) acquisition. A standalone requirements document is being developed.

FY 2021 RDTE funding in the amount of $3.648 million will be utilized to continue test &amp; evaluation and Logistics product development under the CRS(I) contract, mature the Universal Robotic Controller to meet the requirements in the CRS(I) CDD and Universal Controller Information System (UC IS) CDD and emerging programs of record, controller software, architecture, interface updates, and integration and test the URC into other Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) programs of record via an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP). This funding will also be used to establish a common software architecture for Unmanned Ground Vehicles and Unmanned Air Systems (UAS).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Robotic Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts. It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interfaces, common software and common architecture for robotics &amp; autonomous platforms, payloads &amp; universal controllers. It will establish a Common Specifications Reference (CSR) to provide a repository codifying the Army Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) standards for open architecture, interoperability interfaces, and common control. RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET), Tactical Wheeled Vehicle-Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System (RCIS), Common Robotics System (Medium) (CRS(M), Common Robotics System (Individual), (CRS(I)), Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) Inc. II, Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Enhanced Robotic Payloads (ERP), Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), Robotic Combat (RCV) variants, robotic assault breacher vehicles, robotic applique kits for manned ground systems, etc.), and new standards addressing emerging requirements and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) including Cyber Security, software safety requirements from MIL-STD-882E, new autonomous behaviors &amp; artificial intelligence, new payloads, lethality, etc.
FY 2021 RDTE funds in the amount of $2.702 million supports the further development and finalization of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Ground (RAS-G) Interoperability Profile (IOP) Version 5.0. IOP V5.0 will provide the required modular open interfaces and compliance test tools for new programs including S-MET Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), LRR, CRS(M), TWV-LF, OMFV, RCV, ERP, robotic assault breacher vehicles, and robotic applique kits for manned ground systems. Additionally, FY 2021 RDTE funds will continue the development &amp; hardening of Robotic Operating System, Military (ROS-M) software modules and ROS-M instantiation documents, and management of ROS-M registry &amp; repository infrastructure.

In FY 2021, $.178 million in Reimbursable Manpower for this line has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance.  Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)) is the Army's small sized (&lt;25 lbs.) Soldier back-packable, remotely operated, Common Robotic System. The system provides dismounted Soldiers with increased standoff capability from hazardous threats. The system consists of a Universal Robotic Controller (URC), a suite of various payloads, and an open architecture common mobility platform allowing for future capability growth. The CRS(I) will allow the operator to quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and/or payloads. The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces. This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the Operating Environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated War-fighting Force by providing standoff to the Warfighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations. 

FY 2021 RDTE funding in the amount of $2.352 million will fund the development, testing and validation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), which includes contractor support required for these ECP tasks as well as the development of Modification Work Orders (MWOs).  This funding will also fund further development of Maintainer Technical Manuals and other Logistics products needed to transition to full organic sustainment under Army Full Materiel Release (FMR) in 4th quarter of FY 2021, and resolve open issues listed in the Get Well Plan to meet FMR. This funding also supports programmatic risk mitigation activities including, but not limited to: Cyber Security Controls (i.e. Risk Management Framework), commonality directives, mission payloads, sensors, Condition Based Maintenance, electronics, standard interfaces and architectures, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies, Interoperability (IOP), and analysis of collaborative operations with various Unmanned Systems assigned at Battalion and below in addition to any program management support costs associated with these activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) will help to reduce Soldier loads by transporting mission specific equipment, resupply equipment, and supplies required for extended operations. The S-MET will be capable of carrying the equipment currently required to support Infantry and Engineer Platoons in the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) for a 72 hour mission without resupply. The S-MET will reduce Soldier load, increase squad mobility during combat operations and dismounted maneuvers.  S-MET will have open architectures, a remote control and support casualty evacuation, power generation/offload and reintegration of Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) and technical insertions.

FY 2021 RDTE funding in the amount of $5.008 million supports the development, integration, test and purchase of Technical Insertions and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) to increase mission capabilities to meet objective requirements in the Abbreviated Capability Development Document (A-CDD). FY 2021 RDTE funding supports remaining testing at Army Test Engineering Center (ATEC) for the Program of Record. Program support to include salaries, travel and miscellaneous expense for the S-MET program will also be funded.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) Assessment effort was completed as part of the Robotics Development effort under the Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (654641DV7) funding line in FY 2017. This Phase I Assessment supported a rapid start to establish an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) Acquisition Strategy supporting the Directed Requirement, signed 14 April 2017. The Phase I OTA awarded a five-day test event to 8 S-MET prototype solutions in FY 2017 as part of the Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) under the Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (654641DV7) funding line. In FY 2018 Phase II down selected to 4 vendors awarded the Phase II OTA. This OTA provided system testing at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) and issued systems to Soldiers for a 7 month Technology Demonstration. Twenty systems were purchased from each of the 4 vendors issued to IBCTs. This Technology Demonstration guided the development of the Abbreviated Capability Development Document (A-CDD) approved 29 July 2019 following the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) decision on 19 July 2019. 

Project Manager Force Projection (PM FP) received authority from the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE), on 13 Aug 2019, to pursue a Rapid Fielding pathway under Section 804 Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) in accordance with Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Under an approved Section 804 Rapid Fielding pathway, the PM will down select to one or more of the four prototypes and award refurbishment of Phase II systems, completed testing, complete logistics development to provide for an organic support strategy, and proceed into production. 

The Phase III FAR follow on contract for the Program Of Record (POR) production system was awarded on 30 Oct 2019 to General Dynamic Land Systems.  Army Contracting Command - Warren received a Government Accountability Office (GAO) level protest on 14 Nov 2019.  In response to the protest, the Government will be taking corrective action and resoliciting the Phase III requirement.  The planned Request for Proposal (RFP) release is on 29 Jan 2020, with a target award date of 30 Apr 2020.

It is the Army's intent to maximize the use of an Open Systems Architecture (OSA), as well as the approved Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) interoperability profiles (IOP) for S-MET. The PdM plans to gather sufficient data during the S-MET Technology Demonstration to reduce development efforts and provide cost savings by incorporating the developed S-MET technology to include future technical insertions and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) into the Program of Record. Throughout the life of the program, the Army will continue to survey the marketplace to identify opportunities for technology insertions and required Modular Mission Payloads (MMP), relying on competition to drive down costs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Robotics Enhanced Program (REP) uses a "buy/lease, try and inform" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.

This program has no FY 2021 RDTE funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS) is a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The SBS provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver. The system is simple to deploy and use to support the squad leader's decision-making process. The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.  Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. 

In FY 2020, this project and funding transitioned to PE: 0604827A / Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem/Val, Project FK4.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Universal Robotic Controller (URC) provides the capability to individually and/or concurrently control multiple Unmanned Systems (UxS) platforms and control/monitor a mesh network without having to obtain and/or carry separate Operator Control Unit (OCUs) for each system. A controlled UxS may be mobile or stationary, can be smart learning, and self-adaptive. Two URCs will be used to hand-off control of a system to a receiver, reducing hand-off time and the need for the UxSs to have multiple OCUs. The URC will also be capable of "hot swapping" batteries where one of its two batteries can be replaced without the system being shut down, halting mission progress, and use current or new Soldier power sources that will maximize its operational time and minimize the number of replacement batteries needed for most missions. The intent of this requirement is to allow the Soldier at battalion and below to use the URC to operate unmanned aerial systems (e.g. Raven, PUMA, Short Range Micro (SRM), etc.) and unmanned ground vehicles (e.g. Common Robotic System (Individual) CRS(I), CRS (Vehicle)(V), CRS (Medium)(M), CRS (Heavy)(H), Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET), Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) INC II, Light Reconnaissance (LR), Wingman, Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV), etc.) and emerging unmanned air/ground systems. The URC is defined in the CRS(I) Capability Development Document (CDD) and is included in the CRS(I) acquisition. A standalone requirements document is being developed.

FY 2021 RDTE funding in the amount of $3.648 million will be utilized to continue test evaluation and Logistics product development under the CRS(I) contract, mature the Universal Robotic Controller to meet the requirements in the CRS(I) CDD and Universal Controller Information Systems (UC IS) CDD and emerging programs of record, controller software, architecture, interface updates, and integration and test the URC into other Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAS) programs of record via an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP). This funding will also be used to establish a common software architecture for Unmanned Ground Vehicles and Unmanned Air Systems moving forward. Support development of IS CDD (Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Cost- Benefit Analysis (C-BA)).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The controller will also use haptic indicators inside the hand grips to give the user active feedback of the controlled system's movements if the UxS software is programmed to use them. If and when the use of lethal systems on the URC is approved, the weaponized payloads will be controlled via several fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability in the near- and mid-terms. Efforts will include accelerated materiel development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project funds an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance in accordance with the National Defense Strategy. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs.  Current efforts include Directed Energy; Long Range Precision Fires; Air and Missile Defense; Cyber; Artificial Intelligence; Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Counter UAS (C-UAS); Communications; Survivability; and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities as designated by the RCCTO Board of Directors. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats for transition to programs of record. Funding may also be used to acquire specialized expertise to execute an initiative.

The Army RCCTO expedites the fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet urgent needs and support the Army modernization strategy. The RCCTO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally.  The RCCTO procures prototypes and evaluates solutions to field residual combat capability to a unit of action and transition the capability to an acquisition program for production and sustainment when it is an enduring need.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Specifically, significant FY 2021 funds will be used to procure 3 Directed Energy prototype systems supporting the Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) mission. Additionally, funds  projects selected from RCCTO Innovation Days, an event that reviews innovative solutions that have the potential to reduce near and mid-term operational risk against near-peer adversaries and push traditional boundaries to deliver breakthrough prototypes with residual combat capability.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army RCCTO capitalizes on current and emerging technologies to provide near-term and mid-term solutions to address emerging threats and high impact capability opportunities for U.S. Army Forces deployed globally. This is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and 2) developing emerging deployable capability through research and development organizations, academia, and industry. The RCCTO uses streamlined acquisition methods, processes and techniques to rapidly acquire capability; these methods vary by project. The RCCTO has procurement authority and an in-house contracting staff, with the flexibility to use both traditional and non-traditional contracting approaches.  To reach non-traditional vendors, RCCTO will use non-standard contracting methods, such as Other Transaction Authority agreements. Where practicable, prototypes will be acquired using competitive procedures. Soldier touchpoints will be conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation, prototype maturation, fielding residual combat capability to a unit of action, and future capability development. When designated by the RCCTO Board of Directors, projects will be transitioned to an approved acquisition program for production and sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds rapid prototyping and delivery of residual combat capability to enable the Army Modernization Priorities and the National Defense Strategy. These efforts include long range precision fires, air and missile defense, ground, aviation, Soldier, cyber, and command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance &amp; reconnaissance (C4ISR) missions. The primary goal is to deliver experimental prototypes to a unit of action through a collaborative and accelerated acquisition process.  Technologies will be demonstrated in relevant environments, performing tactical/operational scenarios. Efforts will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability in the near- and mid-terms. Efforts will include accelerated materiel development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance in accordance with the National Defense Strategy. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs in Directed Energy; Long Range Precision Fires; Air and Missile Defense; Cyber; Artificial Intelligence; Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Counter UAS (C-UAS); Communications; Survivability; and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities as designated by the RCCTO Board of Directors. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical Program of Record capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats. Funding may also be used to acquire specialized expertise to execute an initiative.

The Army RCCTO expedites the fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet urgent needs and support the Army modernization strategy. The RCCTO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally.  The RCCTO procures prototypes and evaluates solutions to field residual combat capability to a unit of action and transition the capability to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This Project is a New Start in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides funding for authorized civilian workforce performing medical research, development, acquisition management and oversight that support the medical research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) programs at the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), Fort Detrick, Maryland to: (1) perform planning, programming, and budgeting; (2) manage resources; and (3) ensure compliance with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory and safety requirements. It also provides for continued operations of contracting and acquisition management functions performed by the United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the USAMRDC Medical RDTE Program.

Additionally, this Project provides funding for the Special Immunization Program (SIP). The SIP program provides FDA licensed vaccines and investigational new drug (IND) vaccines under informed consent to laboratory workers at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and to other military, government, or contractor personnel who may be at risk of exposure to highly hazardous pathogenic microorganisms or toxins.

Funding was transferred from the Defense Health Program to the Army in Fiscal Year 2021.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Funding is provided to the USAMRDC for Medical Research Development Acquisition (RDA) Management and Oversight to include the payroll of civilians as well as nominal operating expense. Expertise helps establish and maintain the capabilities that Army medicine needs to sustain life, limb, and eyesight for our warfighters. Civilian labor performs centralized management of Medical RDA (many areas required by law and/or regulation) including animal and human research protections, health and safety compliance, environmental management, United States Food and Drug Administration regulatory compliance, legal support (including intellectual property protection), quality assurance, contracting services, personnel management, and planning, programming, and budgeting, and execution management. Funding also supports the Army's portion of the Special Immunization Program that protects individuals engaged in infectious disease research if exposed to pathogens or toxins.</r2:Description>

System performance is near or at planned operational system levels.  

Projects are characterized by mature system development, integration, demonstration to support Milestone C decisions, conducting live fire test and evaluation, and initial operational test and evaluation of production representative articles.

Selected programs within this budget line will exhibit a logical progression of program phases, development and production funding within the FYDP, consistent with the Department's full funding policy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Rucksack Portable Unmanned Aircraft System (RPUAS) Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (FoSUAS) provides battalion and below ground maneuver elements with critical situational awareness and enhanced force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnaissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the FoSUAS products.

The RPUAS FoSUAS provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements with an organic, on-demand, asset to develop situational awareness, enhance force protection, and secure routes, points, and areas. The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnaissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data. The RPUAS FoSUAS includes a combination of three separate hand-launched mission specific configurable aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery. The three separate mission specific configurable Unmanned Aircraft (UA) are the Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR)), the Medium Range Reconnaissance (MRR), and the Long Range Reconnaissance (LRR).  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable handheld ground control station (H-GCS) which incorporates the Tactical Open Government Owned Architecture (TOGA).  FoSUAS will utilize existing RQ-11 in a system of systems fielding concept, with Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) and Long Range Reconnaissance (LRR) options under development.

Justification: FY 2021 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $5.999 million for Program Management Engineering support and to meet Capabilities Production Document (CPD) Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to conduct SRR Tranche II system development, integration, testing and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The AMF radios are software programmable, multi-band, multi-mode, mobile ad hoc networking radios, providing simultaneous voice and data communications for Army Aviation platforms.  The radios were planned to operate in networks supporting the Common Operating Picture, Situational Awareness, and interoperability of Mission Command systems throughout the battlefield.  AMF radios were planned to ensure the Soldier's ability to communicate both horizontally and vertically via voice and data within all mission areas and Common Operating Environment.  AMF radios were planned to operate waveforms that are deployed by Joint Forces today, and would have introduced networking waveforms to the Aviation community that would have enabled interoperability between air and ground forces and transport operational and Mission Command information through the tactical network.  AMF radios were planned to help close capability gaps by extending data networking to company and below echelons, enabling network services to the platform and connecting Army Aviation platforms to Army ground and Joint air network domains. 

On 17 July 18, the Army Acquisition Executive signed both the SANR Closeout Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) and SANR Termination plan.  The ADM and plan initiated a program termination action and directed an orderly shutdown of the SANR program.  

The SANR subprogram (Project EG6) has no approved requirement and all SANR funding has been withdrawn in FY 2020 and beyond.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Prior to FY 2014, the Airborne Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) was funded under Navy PE 0604280N, aligned under the Navy JTRS Programs. In accordance with a July 11, 2012 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), the JTRS Program of Record transitioned to a Military Department-managed program. AMF is now managed by Program Executive Office Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, under Project Manager Tactical Radios, and funded by Army PE 0605380A. On May 2, 2014, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, issued an ADM that designated Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) and Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) as subprograms under the AMF Program. In FY 2015, Project EA9 represented the total Airborne Maritime Fixed Small Airborne (AMF-SA, or SALT) RDT&amp;E budget. In FY 2016, funding was allocated between the SALT (Project EA9) and SANR (Project EG6) subprograms.  The SANR subprogram (Project EG6) has no approved requirement and funding has been withdrawn in FY 2020 and beyond.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Per MDA direction, AMF JTRS would have procured SANR radios as Non-Developmental Items (NDI).  The SANR was planned as a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency Type 1 certified networking radio providing seamless real-time information for operation in mobile and dynamic combat environments to meet tactical communications requirements as validated by the Army Aviation community.  SANR was planned to provide increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms via advanced networking capabilities supporting Mid-Tier and Lower Tier tactical networks, and maintain Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capability.  SANR was planned to replace the current SINCGARS radios on Army Aviation platforms.  SANR was planned for implementation on the following platforms: Apache (AH-64E), Black Hawk (UH-60V, UH-60M, HH-60M, and MH-60M), Chinook (CH-47F and MH-47G), and Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (MQ-1C) aircraft.  SANR was planned to enhance and further enable the ability of the maneuver commander to integrate and synchronize aviation forces with land based operational forces. SANR, was planned to be employed on Army aviation platforms, enable aviation combat elements (Combat Aviation Brigades, Theater Aviation Brigades, and Special Operations Aviation Regiment) to better utilize the inherent versatility of airborne communications as a complement to the unique capabilities of the other combat arms.  SANR planned to provide commanders enhanced Situational Awareness and Mission Command in a package that provides a more responsive means of directing aircraft to match changing maneuver forces situations and missions.

On 17 July 18, the Army Acquisition Executive signed both the SANR Closeout Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) and SANR Termination plan.  The ADM and plan initiated a program termination action and directed an orderly shutdown of the SANR program.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) program is an Army-led, Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) with joint interest with the United States (U.S.) Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and U.S. Navy. The JAGM is the next generation of aviation-launched, fire and forget missiles to replace the HELLFIRE Laser and Longbow radar missiles. JAGM will be used by joint service aircraft for destruction of high value stationary, moving, and relocatable land and maritime targets from standoff range in day, night, adverse weather, and obscured battlefield conditions.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 dollars in the amount of $8.900 million will continue the objective platform review, analysis, and threat management; continue the development of the Captive Air Training Missile (CATM) to address training needs; continue test and evaluation and develop documentation for Air Worthiness Release.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) program is a designated Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).

The AIAMD program is a direct response to the U.S. Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Concept and Operational and Organizational (O&amp;O) Plan for the Future Force, the AIAMD System of Systems (SoS) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and the AMD Task Force Concept of Operations (CONOPS). The AIAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching SoS capability with all participating Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing (1) the IAMD Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that provides the common Mission Command capability, (2) the Integrated Fire Control Relay capability for fire control connectivity and distributed operations, and (3) the common Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) Kits that network enable multiple sensor components, weapon components, and the IBCS EOC.

The AIAMD Program will provide advanced capabilities to the Army and the soldier by allowing transformation to a network-centric SoS capability (also referred to as "Plug and Fight") that integrates AMD sensors and weapons with the IBCS EOC. The AIAMD SoS architecture will enable extended range and non-line-of-sight engagements, to include joint kill chain engagements across the full spectrum of aerial threats, providing fire control quality data to the most appropriate weapon to complete the mission successfully. Further, it will mitigate the coverage gaps and the single points of failure that have plagued AMD design in the past. The AIAMD program will provide the user with the ability to train on a single IBCS that will result in overall training savings. The AIAMD program will also provide the Army with the ability to procure components that will interface with the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN), alleviating the cost of procuring total system capabilities in the future. 

AIAMD IOC will be delivered through the fielding of the IBCS-based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS EOC, Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) Relay, Sentinel, and Patriot components working in an integrated manner through the IFCN connection. The government controlled open architecture enables integration of future capabilities to meet emerging threats and fielding to include Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade, Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD).

Funding in FY 2021 supports agile software development and integration, developmental testing, and operational testing, with an Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) beginning in fourth quarter FY 2021.  Software development in version 4.6.0 will include required changes for IOT&amp;E and beyond-IOC capabilities.  The exact composition of the software build will be determined based on agile development concepts in which the user determines the priorities from the backlog in a 4.6.0 Capabilities Review in the third quarter FY 2020 and Program Increment (PI) planning sessions just prior to the start of each PI.  Specific test efforts include: developmental testing and requirements verification of the versions 4.5.1 and 4.6.0 software; delta qualification; interoperability certification; events leading up to IOT&amp;E including Logistics Demonstration, New Equipment Training, Collective Training, and test planning; and the start of IOT&amp;E.  The IOT&amp;E supports a Full Rate Production Decision in third quarter FY 2022.  

AIAMD is a critical component of the Army's Air and Missile Defense strategy and is the number one AMD Cross Functional Team modernization priority program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

As part of the DoD Section 873 pilot as directed in Section 869 of the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), IAMD will use Agile development processes to develop additional capabilities above and beyond those delivered at IOC.  The exact composition of the software build will be determined based on agile development concepts in which the user determines the priorities from the backlog in a 4.6.0 Capabilities Review in the third quarter FY 2020 and Program Increment (PI) planning sessions just prior to the start of each PI.  As part of the Agile process, the user will prioritize and direct the firm requirements/capabilities to be developed within the development cycle as guided by a user-prioritized roadmap. The specific requirements to be developed in FY 2021 may include: convergence of integrated fires capability; incorporation of THAAD planner; integration of Lower Tier AMD Sensor (LTAMDS); integration of other user directed sensors; and other requirements pulled from the backlog.  Additional efforts will include system engineering and integration, software requirements verification, logistics product updates, contractor test support, Information Assurance /Cyber Security support, integration support from prime contractors of integrated systems, Technical Data Package (TDP) updates for hardware obsolescence and engineering change proposals (ECPs); and government systems engineering and programmatic support.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This program is an integral part of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) architecture.  It provides for development of a common Integrated Fire Control System through an open architecture approach allowing for integration of Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components as they become available. This approach enables the AIAMD program to pursue its baseline program independent of fluctuation of other programs.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AIAMD acquisition strategy is to deliver an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY 2022. The capabilities are delivered through the fielding of the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS Engagement Operations Center (EOC), Sentinel, and Patriot (through a Radar Interface Unit (RIU)) components connected via an Integrated Fire Control Relay, working in an integrated manner. Future capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Indirect Fire Protection Capabilities (IFPC), Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade, Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries, and other Army and Joint net-centric architectures using an agile software development process.

Key principles of the AIAMD acquisition approach are the following:
-  Migrate from system-based acquisition to competitive component-based acquisition using agile development/operations methodology IAW FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act direction
-  Use system-of-systems acquisition approach with collaboration among AIAMD, PEO MS, PEO C3T, and Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization Component Project Offices, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other Service Project Offices to network-enable weapons and sensor components
-  Develop and procure a common Army IBCS EOC that replaces seven weapon system unique Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) components
-  Establish product lines used to evaluate and select, modify and integrate modular open systems hardware and software common configuration items
-  Conduct architecture-based System Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&amp;T) activities for an incrementally fielded configuration of the AIAMD Integrated Fire Control Network-compatible IBCS EOC, weapons and sensor system components

Beginning in FY 2019, AIAMD is included in the DoD Section 873 Agile Development pilot as directed in Section 869 of the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.  As part of this pilot, the AIAMD government team will take on additional responsibilities for software development and will initially implement activities under an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement through FY 2021.  Beyond the initial OTA, software as a service type contracts with multiple vendors (to include non-traditional defense contractors) is planned.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) is a purpose built manned platform that maneuvers Soldiers to a point of positional advantage to engage in close combat. It is designed to operate with and may operate without a crew and Soldiers under armor based on the commander's decision. It delivers decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver while also controlling maneuver robotics and semi-autonomous systems. The platform will be optimized for operations in dense urban terrain and with significantly reduced logistical burdens. The vehicle will include an architecture to allow for increased capability and growth margin. In close combat, the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) will deliver decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver. The changing character of warfare drives changes in how the Army delivers, operates, and sustains future combat capabilities. The Army's first priority is to replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle with the OMFV.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 'National Integration To Tactical Systems (Military Intelligence Program - MIP)' funds provide for transition and integration of National Intelligence Community (IC) advanced technologies and prototypes leveraged by the Army's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program office. The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy with Army investments. Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  Army TENCAP facilitates the continued access to National Intel Community (IC) 'joint' efforts and compatibility with those National standards and software baseline for those Army PORs that benefit from these leveraged National IC technologies, resulting in cost-savings through cost-sharing, and Army participation in collaborative Intelligence. Funds will be used for final-stage integration efforts identified and vetted through the Army TENCAP annual TGOSG, such as: advanced Air Vigilance software enhancements; POR sensor integration into the Theater Net-Centric Geolocation network; integration of the future Advanced Miniaturized Data Acquisition System (AMDAS - Next) capability into (pending) POR TITAN  and operational concepts;  transition and integration of Army TENCAP technologies discovered and leveraged by the annual Military Exploitation of Reconnaissance and Intelligent Technology (MERIT) project selection process, as well as other transitioning technologies discovered and/or leverage through other joint TENCAP outreach efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Vigilance systems are a software based solution that collect critical intelligence data on emerging threat aerial systems. The intelligence data provides early warning of operations in restricted airspace to ensure force protection. An Air Vigilance system is comprised of a server unit configured and fielded with a single or multiple sub-component sensors. System Quantities are based upon server units. Operational details are classified.

FY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $3.451 million provides for system development and integration of latest software developments and hardware configurations in accordance with Capability Drop (CD) 3 requirements. This completes the BOIP of 39 sensors and 10 servers and reaches Full Deployment (FD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Vigilance (AV) is an ACAT III Automated Information System (AIS) program of record (POR) that originated from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developed and fielded cooperatively with the Intelligence Community (IC) through the efforts and mission of the Army's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) office.  The QRC was transitioned into an Army AIS POR by the AAE in May 2013 and assigned to Army Program Executive Office - Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEWS), the chartered acquisition authority for management and execution of the Army's TENCAP mission and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for the AV POR.  The Army TENCAP continues to leverage the IC common software development and support contract to field the AV systems, and ensure this primarily software based system can continue to access and leverage the common software, and input or ingest the latest sensor collects into the common IC data library.  As an AIS POR, the AV POR is currently fielding systems per its Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) and with software and system capabilities that meet its latest validated Capability Drop (CD) requirements. The AV POR is currently scheduled to meet Full Deployment (FD) by 2021, and will continue to evolve to meet future validated Capability Drop requirements and maintain its effectiveness against emerging threats.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The JLTV Family of Vehicles (FoV), to include a companion trailer, is a United States Army (USA) acquisition lead, joint program with the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). The JLTV is capable of performing multiple mission roles and designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full range of military operations. JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current fleet; and, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency, reliability, and maintaining effective competition throughout the life cycle. Commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost. Unique service requirements have been minimized.  The JLTV Trailer (JLTV-T) is the companion trailer to the JLTV and safely carries its payload while maintaining the same mobility characteristics of the prime mover.  The trailer requirement as defined in the Capability Production Document (CPD), dated 21 November 2014 was validated on 7 June 2019 by the Army and required the JLTV and JLTV-T to be fielded as a system.  On November 2019, Army Futures Command validated the JLTV-T Army Procurement Objective (APO) of 18,224.

This program element supports modernization of the JLTV FoV by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.  This program element also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.

The FY 2021 budget supports the procurement of test assets and the finalization of engineering efforts such as: Li-Ion based technologies and survivability enhancements to optimize the JLTV system architecture and drastically reduce operations and support (O&amp;S) costs; Ongoing development of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) system packaging optimization efforts such as Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) and Integrated Vision Augmentation System (IVAS); Ongoing testing to ensure cyber vulnerabilities are considered and mitigated.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JLTV Family of Vehicles (FoV), to include a companion trailer, is a United States Army (USA) lead, joint program with the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). 

The JLTV Program entered the Production and Deployment Phase with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorization on 25 August 2015.  With Milestone C approval, the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) fixed price contract was awarded to Oshkosh Defense LLC on 25 August 2015.  This contract consists of a three year LRIP period with options for five additional years of Full Rate Production (FRP) deliveries.  JPO JLTV procured the Technical Data Package (TDP) with appropriate data rights to allow for possible future competition for production vehicles and spares.  Current contract options may be exercised through 30 November 2023 assuming contractual quantity headspace is still available. Current funding indicates headspace quantity of 16,901 may be achieved in FY 2021, with competitive follow on contract award also anticipated in FY 2022. A split procurement will occur between the existing Oshkosh contract and the new competitively awarded contract based on the approved acquisition strategy. 

Program achieved a successful FRP decision May 2019. The FRP Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed June 2019.

The trailer requirement as defined in the Capability Production Document (CPD), dated 21 November 2014  was validated on 7 June 2019 by the Army and required the JLTV and JLTV-T to be fielded as a system.  On November 2019, Army Futures Command validated the JLTV-T Army Procurement Objective (APO) of 18,224.

The JLTV program will continually monitor emerging technologies and capabilities through its partnerships with U.S. Army and Marine Corps science and technology organizations as well as through industry market research and partnerships. The JLTV program will look for opportunities to implement increased capabilities throughout the systems Life Cycle.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project is a Military Intelligence Program (MIP). TROJAN research and development supports TROJAN Next Generation (TROJAN NexGEN), formerly TROJAN Classic XXI (TCXXI), future capabilities to fulfill the Army's need for worldwide, deployable, remotable, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support that can dynamically execute operations from sanctuary-based to deployed assets in theater. In support of Army Modernization and Army Force Generation, TROJAN NexGEN will provide soldiers with a real-world, hands-on, live and near-real time Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) training environment sustaining, maintaining and enhancing their military occupational specialty proficiencies and specific target expertise. This operational readiness training will fulfill the Army's larger intelligence training requirement via a secure, collaborative architecture. 

A key factor for future force success is the ability to collect, process, and use information about an adversary while preventing similar information from being disclosed. TROJAN NexGEN is a combined operational and readiness mission system which uses advanced networking technology to provide seamless rapid radio relay, secure communications to include voice, data, and electronic reconnaissance support to U.S. forces throughout the world. TROJAN NexGEN operations may be easily tailored to fit military intelligence unit training schedules and surged during specific events to involve every aspect of the tactical intelligence collection, processing, analysis and reporting systems. Engineers test and evaluate new digital intelligence collection, processing and dissemination technology using the fielded TROJAN NexGEN systems prior to the acquisition of those technologies. As part of the objective intelligence architecture, these capabilities will enable processing and dissemination of real-time intelligence data from various sources to form the intelligence needed to issue orders inside the threat decision cycle. To that end, it is imperative that TROJAN NexGEN keeps pace with digitization initiatives in order to respond aggressively to the emerging intelligence communication threat.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for tactical Electronic Warfare (EW) terrestrial (ground) employment applications. The systems under this program provide the Army with the capability to detect, identify, locate, collect/process, report, and engage (disrupt, degrade or deny) hostile forces to prevent their effective use of communications &amp; non-communications networks, counter-mortar/counter-battery radars, surveillance radars, electronically fused munitions and other enemy threats using the Electro-Magnetic Spectrum (EMS).

Project EW5 provides for Prophet Enhanced, the current system under the Prophet Ground acquisition program. Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade enabling the most effective engagement of enemy forces. Prophet Enhanced provides a modular, scalable, open architecture based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations.

Project EW6 provides for the Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT), a Department of the Army established project to develop techniques, methods, tools and architecture to reprogram mission software embedded in Army EW systems, Force Protection Systems (FPS), and Target Sensing Systems (TSS) in response to changes in threat signatures.  ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within intelligence systems, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop EW Mission Software and Products (MSP) for both air and ground EW systems, 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MSPs, 4) improved communications conduits to transmit mission software changes to field users, and 5) enhanced mission-software uploading tools. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, simulation, mission software development, distribution and uploading of mission software changes directly to the supported Soldier in the field.  The ARAT project will develop, test and equip an Army-wide infrastructure capable of rapidly reprogramming electronic combat software embedded in offensive and defensive weapon systems.

Project FJ5 is a New Start for this Program Element in FY 2021 that provides for follow on development of the Terrestrial Layer System (TLS), an effort that initiates in FY 2020 (funded with PE 0604021A / AW7). TLS will provide Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Cyber-enabling integrated solution to support Multi Domain Battle capability gaps and provide Force Protection, Situational Development, and Information Superiority to the maneuver forces.

FY 2021 funds Electronic Warfare (EW) Development for Prophet Enhanced efforts (Project EW5), the Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) efforts (Project EW6) and Terrestrial Layer System efforts (Project FJ5).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) is a Department of the Army established program to develop techniques, methods, tools, and architecture to rapidly reprogram mission software embedded in Army Electronic Warfare (EW) Force Protection Systems (FPS) in response to changes in threat signatures. The regulatory guidance directing this mission is contained in Army Regulation (AR) 525-15, AR 525-22, and AR 95-1. The ARAT develops integrated technical solutions required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW Signal threats to US Forces. The ARAT mission software reprogramming infrastructure supports the Army Campaign Plan to provide the Regionally Aligned Forces tactical Commander timely rapid-reprogramming capability of EW systems with mission software.  The ARAT mission responsibility is to develop and distribute Mission Software and Products to forward deployed combat forces. ARAT identifies and analyzes worldwide threat signature changes which affect EW systems; determines the impact of observed Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) signature changes; rapidly develops new mission software to adapt friendly systems to detect and defeat enemy threats to U.S. Army ground and air platforms; disseminates the Mission Software and Products to forward deployed forces, and provides government developed tools and software to upload new mission software into the affected EW systems.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Current military operations are conducted in a rapidly changing threat environment, where Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Infra Red (IR) man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) seekers, radar guided surface-to-air-missiles (SAM), laser guided weapons, anti-helicopter mines, and targeting sensors are proliferating and evolving. Integrated solutions are required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW threats.  The ARAT reprogramming infrastructure supports the tactical Commander by providing timely rapid reprogramming of mission software and information dissemination for Army supported, Joint and allied services.  ARAT supports integrated reprogramming of target acquisition, target engagement, vehicle survivability, and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE). ARAT rapid-reprogramming infrastructure supports tactical requirements for deployed aircraft and ground-based (e.g. Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (CREW)) survivability systems. ARAT identifies and analyzes threat signature changes which affect EW systems; determines the impact of observed signature changes; develops new mission software to adapt the system to the changes; disseminates the mission software; and provides methods to upload the new mission software into the affected EW systems. Each element within the ARAT infrastructure plays a specific role within the program's rapid reprogramming process, providing the Soldier with the capability to install mission and target identification software at the lowest possible level, thus maximizing flexibility for tactical commanders. ARAT participates in the operational and developmental test design of Army EW systems, and supports Joint Service Reprogramming Exercises in all theaters. ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within the intelligence system, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop Mission Software and Products (MSP), 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MSPs, 4) improved communications conduits to rapidly transmit mission software to upload into supported EW systems. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, threat modeling and simulation, mission software development and testing, distribution and uploading of mission software directly to the supported Soldier in the field.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Due to the sophistication of emerging threat weapon systems ARAT will increase the amount of test points required to validate the release of mission software.  ARAT will need to continue enhancing it's infrastructure  to rapidly develop and test mission software.  ARAT has procured new threat simulators that require software to allow the simulators to replicate enemy weapon system radars.  Simulation software allows ARAT to replicate sophisticated enemy radar systems that are required to conduct laboratory testing of mission software.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Terrestrial Layer System (TLS) is a new start effort in FY 2020, and FJ5 is a New Start Project in FY2021. TLS provides Army maneuver forces integrated full spectrum Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Cyber-enabling non-kinetic offensive operation options to Brigade Combat Team (BCT) and Expeditionary-Military Intelligence Brigade (EMIB) commanders. TLS' information Superiority provides Indications and Warnings, Force Protection and Situational Awareness to influence the commander's decision cycle, improve targeting timeliness and accuracy, and provide the maneuver commander with electronic attack and offensive cyber warfare options to deny, degrade, disrupt, or otherwise manipulate the targeted force. TLS employs technologically advanced systems with a modular open-system approach for multiple configurations that can be efficiently sustained and effectively upgraded to provide capabilities against changing near peer and emerging threats to address multi-domain capability gaps.

Justification:
FY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $38.105 million funds system level prototyping, platform integration and testing efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

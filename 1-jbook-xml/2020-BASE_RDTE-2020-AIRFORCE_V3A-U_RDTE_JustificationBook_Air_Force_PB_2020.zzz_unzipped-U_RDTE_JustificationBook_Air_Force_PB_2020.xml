                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) is a family of systems construct that provides battle management and command and control capability by networking, ingesting, fusing, and prioritizing data from disaggregated sensors.  ABMS is not a single program of record but a capability that is provided by multiple integrated systems and programs and will be horizontally managed by the ABMS Architect.  ABMS will develop sensors, battle management and command and control systems, and communications through a three phased strategy.  Funding in this program element will be used for execution of efforts under the ABMS Architect Activities: sensor development, prototyping and risk reduction, architecture analysis, development and management of open architecture standards, Phase 1 and Phase 2 bridge capabilities, and Phase 3 development.  Funding may be used to fund other programs within the ABMS architecture.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ABMS.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) will provide capability through existing programs of record and their respective contracts and agreements.  ABMS is not a single program of record, but many programs that are horizontally integrated by a single lead Architect.  Program execution (cost, schedule, performance) is vertically managed by program executive officers and their respective program offices.  Funding for programs that are directly or indirectly supporting ABMS will be executed through existing program elements.  ABMS may execute funding from this program element to supplement supporting programs, or fully fund discrete components of ABMS specific technologies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program executes and provides technical and programmatic support to the testing, evaluation, and mitigation of effects of nuclear weapon employment that impact Air Force systems with initial emphasis on existing nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and associated communications systems.  It includes facilities and equipment required to perform testing, risk assessments, survivability/vulnerability studies, and effectiveness evaluation of various mitigation strategies.  It includes modeling and simulation efforts for systems of systems analysis where assessments are not possible through testing alone.  This program will recommend upgrades to existing/fielded systems as well as informing requirements for future (modernization/recapitalization) systems.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605833F Acquisition Workforce - Nuclear Systems.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program, BA 7, PE 0604233F, project 676035, Controlled Flight Into Terrain - Prevention (CFIT-Prevention), is a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supports Air Education and Training Command's implementation of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training and the Department of Defense initiative for joint pilot training.

Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training supports Air Education and Training Command's implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training. This program provides and maintains the currency of Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment Desktop Training System.

T-6 Operational System Development continues follow on development activities to JPATS including but not limited to studies &amp; development efforts, instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources(DMS) and development activities related to DMS. Included is development for the Next Generation On-Board Oxygen Generation System, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out), Crash Survivable Recorder (CSR),Controlled Flight Into Terrain - Prevention (CFIT-Prevention), Pilot Training Next (PTN) and associated upgrades. There are currently 444 aircraft in the Air Force inventory. The aircraft were designed with a 24 year service life. Remaining service life is up to 16 years from the final delivery in May 2010.

The T-38 program continues studies &amp; development efforts supporting future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to address DMS issues and the regular block upgrades required to keep the system current. Block upgrades incorporate software and/or hardware improvements for the aircraft and aircrew training devices to address flight safety issues and to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, or National Airspace System.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Specialized Undergraduate Flight Training capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $0.659 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Training (URT). URT produces RPA pilots and Sensor Operators from accession sources to man RPA squadrons. Success of the program is heavily dependent on Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System to prepare undergraduate students for entry in RPA Formal Training Units (FTU). PRIME has completed seven Phases of development and is now at baseline functionality. PRIME is a desktop trainer similar to the Reaper training system now in use to train undergraduate RPA pilots and sensor operators. PRIME currently emulates the MQ-9 Reaper and needs to keep pace with that baseline system and expand to other RPAs in order to maintain concurrency and relevancy. Funds will also be used to develop enhancements that increase fidelity and functionality.  Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources efforts include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver URT weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T-38 is a twin engine, two seat (tandem), supersonic jet trainer used by Air Education and Training Command as an advanced trainer in Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training. Modifications are budgeted to enhance operational capability while improving flight safety, reliability and maintainability. There are currently 505 T-38's in the Air Force inventory (53 T-38A, 6 AT-38B and 446 T-38C) with 5 T-38Cs pending removal. T-38s first entered service in 1960 and average over 50 years old.

Studies &amp; development efforts supporting future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to address obsolescence issues and the regular block upgrades are required to keep the system current. These will be accomplished with Operations &amp; Maintenance funding unless the block upgrade provides additional capabilities. Block upgrades incorporate software and/or hardware improvements to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, or National Airspace System, and to address flight safety issues. The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices.

L3 Display Systems is unable to continue support of the T-38C Multi-Functional Display (MFD) and the Electronic Engine Display (EED) beyond March 2026.  Development of replacement displays must begin in FY21 to ensure continued AETC pilot production.  There are 2 MFDs and 2 EEDs per aircraft (1,768 displays).  The current Program Office Estimate indicates MFD and EED development funding requirements of FY21 $10.280M and FY22 $10.160M and procurement funding requirements of: FY23 $42.999M and FY24 $45.839M.  Market research is continuing.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver T-38 Operational systems Development weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) consists of two advanced sensor systems, the Stateside Affordable radar System (STARS) and Scorpion, incorporated into a single WAS System. Based on existing technological capabilities, WAS will detect/track low, slow and other asymmetrical threats in the airspace and meet the user needs of sensing stressing airborne targets in complex environments with affordable sensors. The sensor outputs will be incorporated into the Battle Control Systems-Fixed
(BCS-F) air picture and utilized as the North American Aerospace Defense Command/ Northern Command (NORAD/NORTHCOM) Command and Control (C2) air surveillance system of record.

Some aspects of the WAS program are classified and will be provided on a need-to-know basis.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WAS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) strategy is a single step acquisition approach for full capability to develop, produce, and field highly capable and sustainable advanced sensors in the National Capital Region. Science &amp; technology contracts were let prior to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase for both sub-systems. The ongoing Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract for Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) was awarded to a single developer to design, build, integrate, and test the STARS system. A subsequent task order was awarded (Jul 17) to include pre-operational site support. The ongoing CPFF contract for Scorpion was awarded (Aug 17) to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and testing of the Scorpion system, and conduct pre-operational site support. This strategy includes a single delivery approach with 11 STARS and 18 Scorpion systems for a total of 29  sub-systems delivered to achieve FOC. The pre-operational contract for the Scorpion system transitioned to Interim Contract Support (ICS) in Dec 2018, STARS system will award ICS in conjunction with production contracts in FY19.  

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO BM) is the PEO for WAS.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the WAS program and provides contracts, legal, and comptroller support.  The Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ) is the program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Agile Transportation for 21st Century (AT21) supports Theater Capability through development of additional deployment and distribution supporting technology.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program will develop and field an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike aircraft for the United States Air Force, United States Navy, United States Marine Corps and International Partners countries. There are three variants: the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing variant; the F-35B Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant; and the F-35C Aircraft Carrier suitable variant. Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize total air system life cycle costs. Planning and pre-development systems engineering for Block 4 continues as Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is met for each variant during System Development and Demonstration (SDD). 

The JSF Continuous Capability Development &amp; Delivery (C2D2) efforts provide incremental warfighting capability improvements to maintain joint air dominance against evolving threats. Block 4 capability requirements were initiated through ongoing Service-led operational analysis of warfighting gaps identified in the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and through F-35 JSF Block 4 Mission Decomposition analysis completed in FY2014. These analyses serve as the basis for the Block 4 (CDD), staffed through the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) and signed by the USAF Chief of Staff in January 2015. Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the CDD 21 March 2017. Modernization activities in FY2017 and FY2018 include systems engineering, risk reduction, and infrastructure required to deliver full air system Block 4 capabilities to support initial fleet availability of Block 4 upgrades in FY2021.

C2D2 efforts designated as Block 4 include a robust weapons integration portfolio and provide new opportunities for International Partners to assess, integrate, and field unique capabilities based on global sovereign requirements. 

The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway are participants in F-35 modernization. The program shown here reflects United States Air Force funding. Total funding for all Service and International Partners is reported at the accomplishment/planned program level since activities support all aircraft variants. Foreign Military Sales are ongoing separately.

This program element does include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-35 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds wuold be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

PE 0604840F continues funding common requirements for the joint program (US Services and International Partners) previously programmed for in PE 0207142F for common Block 4 requirements beginning in FY20.  This is not a new start.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Modernization effort is the Requirements Decomposition of capabilities for the entire Block 4 upgrade. This is a continuation of the previous Block 4 Requirements Decomposition effort which will include activities leading up to a successful System Functional Review (SFR) and select facility upgrades required for Block 4 research, development, test and evaluation. Included in Block 4 are upgraded capabilities and continuous improvements to maintain Air System viability against evolving threats indicated in the Electronic Warfare Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization ICD, and the Block 4 Capability Development Document (CDD), reduce life cycle cost, and improve operational suitability. Expected completion of a Block 4 Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and  System Requirements Review (SRR) will address additional Block 4 capabilities requirements. Post-PDR risk reduction, preplanning for subsequent Block 4 Modernization events, and investments to deliver the full Block 4 Air System capabilities are included.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) continues to deliver the core logistics infrastructure
requirements for the F-35 enterprise. ALIS includes features such as aircraft scheduling, training delivery and record keeping, technical data delivery, supply chain management, maintenance management, pilot and maintenance debriefing, and mission planning. The ALIS development program is focused on two primary lines of effort: Current ALIS which includes Agile DevOps, and ALIS Next.

Current ALIS is focused on developing new software that uses the current software as a baseline. Upcoming software releases include 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 builds. The required new capabilities have been defined by the US Services and include cybersecurity updates, decentralized maintenance, Prognostic Health Monitoring (PHM), Training Management System upgrades, Personnel Flight Equipment (PFE), Low Observable Health Assessment System (LOHAS), Corrosion Management System, squadron resource sharing, and new propulsion capabilities. All aspects of ALIS software are included in current ALIS development. The software development will have applicability to the Standard Operating Units (SOU), Central Points of Entry (CPE), and the Autonomic Logistics Operating Unit (ALOU) for both classified and unclassified hardware. Under the umbrella of current ALIS, an Agile DevOps pilot is working to rapidly deliver capability updates to the fleet and change the way that current ALIS delivers software.

ALIS Next is the re-architecture effort that began in FY19 and will complete fielding in FY23. ALIS Next will redesign ALIS software, data, and hardware architecture with a focus on cybersecurity, affordability, resiliency, and supportability.</r2:Description>

Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force and currently resides with the Air Force. Program Element 0604800N/0604800M continues USN development efforts budgeted in 0603800N prior to FY2002. The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Norway are participants in the SDD phase of JSF.

PE 0604840F replaces PE 0207142F for common Block 4 requirements beginning in FY20.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C2D2 acquisition strategy is to employ both Cost and Fixed Price Incentive contracts for the Block 4 engineering and development efforts. A new modernization contract structure will be established for all post SDD Block 4 efforts. In addition, a separate Basic Ordering Agreement or Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract is planned to provide a long term approach to upgrading and maintaining laboratories and test aircraft and supporting technology maturation for future C2D2 capabilities. The F-35 Acquisition Strategy is currently being updated to add a section regarding C2D2.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) will be a web-enabled, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will integrate existing personnel and pay processes into one self-service system. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) plans to accomplish this goal by modernizing existing technology, resulting in a secure and authoritative data environment that improves accuracy, strengthens decision making and reduces processing time and costs. AFIPPS supports effective military personnel management and development throughout the lifecycle of all military members, by providing an accurate and single authoritative source of personnel data. Active (RegAF), National Guard (ANG),and Reserve (AFRes) components will integrate personnel and pay functionality; streamline and improve automated support to the mobilization and deployment processes; and implement standard data that reflects the core requirements of the Combatant Commands, the Department of the Air Force, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other federal agencies.

Congress, the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions on how the US military is organized, operated, maintained, and funded. The AFIPPS program will ensure accurate and timely delivery of pay, entitlements, allowances, and benefits information is provided for the Total Force (Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve). AFIPPS represents the AF commitment to modernize business practices and provide enhanced support to service members and their families by integrating personnel and pay systems. AFIPPS will eliminate AF reliance on the end-of-life/unsustainable Defense Finance and Accounting (DFAS) Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) for payroll processing and will ensure continued/improved auditability of service member pay.  The AFIPPS approach utilizes Agile to develop pay capabilities and integrate into existing USAF personnel system.  Additionally,The AFIPPS approach follows the DoD principle of pursuing enterprise solutions, not enterprise systems.  Efforts are underway to establish DoD-level enterprise governance, ensure common standards, and create shared services while pursuing a distinctive approach appropriate for the AF.      

AFIPPS's customers include approximately 510,000 AF service members across all components (RegAF, ANG, and AFRes) including thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield. Congress, the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained.


This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver integrated personnel and pay capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F. Also, funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development, and mobile application.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFIPPS acquisition strategy focuses on expanding the fielded AF personnel system (MilPDS) by integrating a pay capability. MilPDS is implemented using the commercial Oracle ERP E-Business Suite (EBS). The AFIPPS strategy will be to configure/develop the pay portion of EBS, ensure the system is fully integrated, and deployed. The Government awarded a contract for the pay system development, test, and deployment. The development activities will be fully coordinated and integrated with the on-going operation and sustainment of MilPDS.
AFIPPS is using agile software development to the maximum extent practical for a COTS implementation effort. The capability will be broken into epics, and each sprint will be developed and tested by the developer and government on a pre-production system. Once functionality and associated business processes from current payroll and leave systems are incorporated into the pre-production system, AFIPPS will be delivered in a single release in Q2FY21.  The release is strategically planned for January to coincide with all domestic and international financial transactions that occur on the first of the year, mitigating any potential impacts to the warfighter. Incremental releases on top of the existing operational AF Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) are not feasible due to the following: 
• Incremental releases require complementary changes to dependent, disparate Legacy IT systems at the same time; changes to those systems requires resources and scheduling for each system owner and management office 
• Business processes cannot be fielded using a mix of newly re-engineered segments with legacy; an end-to-end re-engineered process is required from day one
• Rapid Change Management and Training is required across the AF to accompany each incremental release
• Changes to MilPDS infrastructure require significant lead time with DISA; cybersecurity mandates are additional approvals
Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AFIPPS. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AFIPPS Program and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller support. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment [OUSD(A&amp;S)] has delegated the program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) for the Air Force.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Anti-Tamper  (AT) Technology Executive Agency budget funds activities related to nine AT responsibilities required by DoDD 5200.47E Anti-Tamper. These responsibilities include areas unique to the DoD Executive Agent for Anti-Tamper (ATEA) and Air Force Component AT Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The ATEA is responsible for developing and implementing AT policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank/library of AT technologies, providing security mechanisms, providing outreach and education to the DoD AT community, providing intel support, and funding validation and evaluations of AT implementations across all DoD acquisition programs. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to develop new AT capabilities and evaluate AT implementations on weapon systems. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F. The AF AT OPR, that is also funded by this PE and is responsible for the oversight and security of AT on all AF acquisition programs under the Program Protection Planning process and manages AF AT technology development. 

The DoD ATEA coordinates technology development among the DoD Services/Agencies, National Laboratories, and Industry.

AT protects critical program information (CPI) in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands on the battlefield. AT protections permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage and the combat capabilities of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters' mission requirements. Furthermore, AT adds longevity to DoD weapon systems and critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against the system or system component. 

All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation on all DoD Weapon Systems, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government off the shelf products. As technology advances, AT continues to perform AT hardware/software assessment capabilities. These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.

The DoD ATEA technology development strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology development across the Services which fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) and facilitate transition for programs to implement. The AT technology development and enhancement efforts include: advanced AT sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and other AT enablers. 

The Air Force AT OPR conducts Anti-Tamper technology development to meet Air Force service needs to mature promising AT technologies to transition to Air Force weapons systems. Technology development priorities are given to those technologies that most benefit AF acquisition programs.  These activities are coordinated through the ATEA as a part of the ATEA technology development roadmap and to coordinate with Navy and Army AT technology development efforts.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DoD ATEA acquisition strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology developments across the Services which fund development and assessments of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts by increasing TRL. The ATEA will coordinate the Technology Roadmap with major Prime vendors. Evaluating their AT CRADA projects is of major importance. The ATEA will also coordinate with the Service AT personnel to foster communication and understand what programs Services are developing for their AT implementation. Emerging research areas such as materials, cryptography and electronic circuits have the potential to bring new AT capabilities with increased processing power, reduced power draw, and smaller form factor. The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapon systems. Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.

The Air Force AT Office will fund and manage new technology efforts to protect Air Force critical program information. These new AT technology requirements will be obtained from AF programs and these new AT technologies will then transition to Air Force programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The Recap program incorporates production line modifications to the C-130J common/baseline configuration to convert them to the HC/MC model, and also funds post-production modifications to add special mission systems required for behind-enemy-line operations required of Combat Rescue and Special Operations aircraft.

The RDT&amp;E portion of the Recap program funds engineering support and studies to conduct rapid development activities, and develops major "block” upgrades to deliver specific increments of capability in common configurations across the fielded fleet.  Currently, Block 7.0/8.1 leverages the baseline C-130J (PE 0401132F) Block 7.0/8.1 upgrade, but funds unique HC/MC-130J integration requirements.  The Block 7.0/8.1 project will deliver Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) capabilities required for compliance with evolving international standards, thereby allowing HC/MC-130J aircraft to operate in international airspace.  It also incorporates capabilities such as Link-16, a new Flight Management System (FMS), Civil GPS Navigation and Data Link, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Transponder Mode-5, and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out).  To meet long-lead item requirements, procurement of some Block 7.0/8.1 kit items begins in FY21.

In 2018 the USAF significantly revamped its HC/MC-130J Block 7.0/8.1. upgrade strategy.  We de-scoped the MC-130J from the current Block 7.0/8.1 focus to allow the MC-130J to prioritize other (SOCOM-funded) modifications while allowing the USAF to move forward with Block 7.0/8.1 on the HC-130J.  Block 8.X, which is now broken out as its own project, will then integrate SOCOM-funded AC/MC-130J capabilities with Block 7.0/8.1. Costs are based on an initial rough order of magnitude estimate and will be revised as the Block 8.X acquisition strategy matures. Both Block 7.0/8.1 and 8.X RDT&amp;E projects include development, trial kit installs and Development and Operational Testing (DT/OT). 

FY2019 Plans:  The HC-130J Block 7.0/8.1 trial kit install effort occur. 

FY20 Plans: Funding for HC-130J Block 7.0/8.1 trial kit install.

In addition to the MC-130J de-scope, the USAF has also decoupled the IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out portions of Block 7.0/8.1, to accelerate those requirements and comply with 2020 mandates.

The USAF also added a budget line to comply with a new Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)  Satellite Communications (SATCOM) mandate; funding for that development begins in FY22, with production deliveries required by FY23.

 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver HC/MC-130J weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F. The program may also include any Contractor Manpower Equivalent (CME)/A&amp;AS support deemed necessary to support the program objectives.

The HC/MC RDT&amp;E permits the initiation and employment of rapid acquisition authorities to respond to emerging threats and requirements as needed.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>HC/MC-130 Recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N and special operations MC-130E/P/H aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.

The HC/MC RDT&amp;E effort integrates Block 7.0/8.1 into a HC-130J, provides program capability updates, studies, and integration with other HC, MC and AC unique modifications. The HC/MC Block 7.0/8.1 program follows the same "Block Upgrade" strategy being used in the C-130J program (PE 0401132F).  
 
The USAF will be fielding the IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out portions of Block 7.0/8.1 ahead of the remaining 36 capabilities in order to comply with the 2020 mandates.

The Block 7.0/8.1 fleet modification program begins in FY 2019.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver HC/MC-130 Recap Program weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605278F.

HC/MC RDT&amp;E permits the initiation and employment of rapid acquisition authorities to respond to emerging threats and requirements as needed.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function. Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces. The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. These functions are accomplished through the NC3 system of systems.

The NC3 system of systems provides connectivity from the President or Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System (NMCS) to nuclear execution forces worldwide. To enhance NC3 mission success, the AF formalized AF NC3 elements as a specified AF Weapon System (WS), AN/USQ-225.  Activities funded in this Program integrate legacy systems, ongoing NC3 programs, and future capabilities for the overall AF NC3 WS.  

The AF Nuclear Weapon Center NC3 Integration Directorate (AFNWC/NC) will ensure current, new, and future NC3 capabilities are fully integrated as part of the Air Force's overall effort to sustain, modernize, and recapitalize the nuclear enterprise.  AFNWC/NC will be responsible for integrating NC3 materiel management across Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) to include authority and responsibility for weapon system architecture, weapon system configuration management, weapon system state-of-health reporting, risk management, supply chain management, overall integration, system test, verification, and certification.  AFNWC/NC is responsible for defining, building, and sustaining current and future AF NC3 WS system of systems configuration baselines, and marshaling necessary Supporting Centers in AFMC and other units/agencies in the Air Force and the Department of Defense (DoD) to support and/or accomplish these tasks.  AFNWC/NC will collaborate with AFMC Supporting Centers to champion the full spectrum of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) efforts, in support of Air Force Global Strike Command as the Lead Command championing NDO requirements for all Combatant Commands. 

This program funds activities for integrating AF NC3 WS materiel, authority, and responsibility for the AF NC3 WS architecture, modeling, simulation, configuration management, risk management, weapon system state-of-health reporting, supply chain supportability and risk management, and overall AF NC3 WS integration, development, system test, verification, fielding, and certification.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds cyber vulnerability assessments of Air Force weapons systems and critical infrastructure as well as non-recurring engineering for mitigations.  The effort leverages the methodology described in the Air Force Cyber Campaign Plan (CCP) to provide Air Force mission assurance in a cyber-contested environment.  Under the Air Force CCP, the Air Force is accomplishing work mandated by Section 1647 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  and Section 1650 of the FY 2017 NDAA.  Section 1647 of the FY 2016 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense. Section 1650 of the FY 2017 NDAA mandates the Secretary of Defense submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessments of this infrastructure. This funding focuses on aspects of the Air Force CCP that develop processes, products, and people to perform the short term goals of conducting system cyber vulnerability assessments, cyber mitigations, and pilot programs and work toward the long term goal of achieving an enduring cyber resilient Air Force.  The program builds upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities, and does not duplicate similar ongoing efforts or conduct redundant assessments on systems that have already been evaluated.

In CY 2019 Assessments and Evaluations Cyber Vulnerabilities was a new start.

In addition, this program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapon system capability. It may also include necessary civilian pay expenses required to perform analysis and developmental activities required in support of the transition of weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Created four (4) new BPACs for traceability purposes. Note that these are not new start programs for FY2020.

Prior to FY2020, project 671803, B-52 AFMC Test Assets funding is documented in Project 675039, B-52 System Improvement 

Prior to FY2020, Project 671805, B-52 VLF/LF Modernization funding is documented in Project 675039, B-52 System Improvement 

Prior to FY2020, Project 671807, B-52 Advanced Target POD MFCD funding is documented in Project 675039, B-52 System Improvement

Prior to FY2020, Project 671810, B-52 AEHF Integration funding is documented in 675041 B-52 Bomber Tactical Data Link</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The B-52H is a long-range bomber capable of delivering the widest variety of nuclear and conventional standoff and direct attack munitions in the Air Force.  The Air Force plans to fly the B-52H to at least 2050.     

The B-52H modernization efforts are needed to perform current and future wartime missions and to ensure relevance, lethality and survivability.  Additionally, modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-52H weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 AFMC Test Assets project will provide funding for the test aircraft, manpower, and facilities at the Air Force Test Center located at Edwards AFB, California. This project will support the developmental testing and sustainment needs of the B-52 weapon system.  Funds include cost of one Test Aircraft #60-036 Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) performed at Tinker AFB OK.   

Costs include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing manufacturing and material shortage (DMSMS) issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 VLF/LF Moderization integrates a receive-only, low frequency receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-52.  This project will consist of integrating an existing VLF/LF terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the VLF/LF provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.)  as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and/or support for potential impact to VLF/LF.  Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Prior to FY2020, Project 671807 B-52 Advanced Target POD MFCD funding is documented in Project 675039 B-52 System Improvements</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) project consists of a monitor upgrade with a 10 gigabyte Ethernet connection. The current targeting pod display is outdated and experiencing a historic break rate. Additionally, the current monitor does not support current and emerging video resolution improvements of the fielded Sniper and LITENING ATPs. The B-52's ATP is now capable of transmitting HD color and video at a much higher resolution than the current monochrome monitor; this upgrade will improve SA and combat lethality.

Costs include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a POR and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing manufacturing and material shortage (DMSMS) issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>B-52 System Improvements is a comprehensive project to facilitate future capabilities and ensure the B-52's viability in performing current and future wartime missions. The scope of work may include development of an AoA, studies and analysis, a CDD, and/or any other analysis or documentation necessary to establish a POR. Additionally, this project may include airborne integration experiments or demonstrations of emerging technologies.

B-52 AMFC Test Support (FY19 funding only)
The B-52 Test Support project will provide funding for the test aircraft, manpower, and facilities at the Air Force Test Center located at Edwards AFB, California. This project will support the developmental testing and sustainment needs of the B-52 weapon system.

B-52 VLF/LF Modernization (FY19 funding only)
The B-52 VLF/LF Modernization integrates a receive-only, low frequency receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-52.  This project will consist of integrating an existing VLF/LF terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the VLF/LF provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.)  as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and/or support for potential impact to VLF/LF.  Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

B-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) (FY19 funding only) 
The B-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) project consists of a monitor upgrade with a 10 gigabyte Ethernet connection. The current targeting pod display is outdated and experiencing a historic break rate. Additionally, the current monitor does not support current and emerging video resolution improvements of the fielded Sniper and LITENING ATPs. The B-52's ATP is now capable of transmitting HD color and video at a much higher resolution than the current monochrome monitor; this upgrade will improve SA and combat lethality.

B-52 Infrared Missile Warning System
The project will complete design, integration, and testing for overseas operations for installation on the B-52.  The current missile warning system was designed in the 1970s and must be replaced to counter current and future threats.  

B-52 Mission Data Recorder
Provides permanent crash survivable flight data recorder information to meet FAA and other regulatory requirements.  Produces digital recordings enhancing aircrew mission reconstruction and release validation in AOR. 

Costs include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a POR and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) Capability Development Document (CDD), dated 18 March 2004, captures the requirements for a Tactical Data Link (TDL) capability on the B-52. The B-52 TDL provides low latency, jam-resistant situational awareness and C2 communications needed to support in-theater operations and missions. This project will consist of integrating an existing off-the-shelf Link 16 terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antennae, and the Group B terminal, blanking unit and notch filter LRUs. The TDL terminal will be fully integrated with CONECT. This Line-of-Sight (LOS) Link 16 capability allows the warfighter to utilize this capability by maintaining situational awareness, avoiding threats, and employing an array of weapons. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. As the Link-16 upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security requirements (JRE messaging, crypto modernization, etc.) as well as other aircraft upgrades (1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB updates, RMP, CERP, etc.) may require study/support for potential impact to the CONECT and Link-16 system. Funds may also be used for Engineering Development Models (EDMs) as well as testing and fielding terminals.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

B-52 Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Integration (In FY19 only)

The B-52 Advance Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Integration SATCOM system provides a survivable, low probability of intercept/detection, high bandwidth system that ensures secure intra/inter-flight and two-way command and control communications in the modern anti-access/aerial denial battle space. This communications upgrade replaces the Military Strategic and Tactical Relay (MILSTAR) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) SATCOM capability (MILSTAR is nearing system end of life) on the B-52. The AEHF Integration effort will integrate the radio, antenna and system components required to provide two-way EHF communication for the B-52. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As AEHF Integration provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.) as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, VLF/LF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and/or support for potential impact to AEHF. Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. Trainers and Upgrades for B-52 AEHF. In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the B-52 Systems Improvements projects will update existing trainers or use Computer-Based Training (CBT) to add any new systems improvement functionality to meet user training requirements and update/maintain the Systems Integration Lab (SIL) for the Weapon System Trainers (WSTs).

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MIL-STD-1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU) enables the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on 78 B-52H aircraft (76 operational plus two (2) Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA)), utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launchers (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs). Three of the CRLs were modified under EMD for test purposes. 

The 1760 IWBU project is segmented into increments. Increment 1.0 provides internal and external carriage of JDAM, Laser-JDAM, JASSM, JASSM/ER, MALD, and MALD/J.  It consists of two sub-increments 1.1 and 1.2. This requirement's CDD was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in June 2013. 

The 1760 IWBU Inc. 1.1 CDD was revalidated as a Capability Production Document (CPD) by the AFROC in February 2015; the 1760 IWBU Inc. 1.2 CPD was approved October 2018.  Development efforts for Increment 1.1 were completed in November 2015 and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in May 2016.  AFGSC declared Full Operational Capability (FOC) in June 2018.  

Increment 1.1 utilizes 44 CSRLs converted into CRLs, where three of the CRLs will be modified under EMD for test purposes.

Increment 1.2 converts 44 CRLs three of which will be modified under EMD and 76 operational B-52H aircraft plus two GITA.

Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J). This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER. 

Increment 1.2 completed Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in October 2015. Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted in March 2016. Milestone B approval was granted in April 2016. An Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) was conducted in May 2016, validating cost and schedule baselines. Long Lead parts approval was granted in October 2016, estimated award August 2018. In addition, a change from Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)/Full Rate Production (FRP) to an FRP-only strategy with 2 lot buys was approved in October 2016.  Lot I/II Approval was granted after the Milestone C Decision, November 2018.

Upon completion of JASSM/ER software development, an interim capability provided for carriage and deployment of no less than 20 JASSM/ER [8 bay (power 4), 12 external] is planned. A combined DT/OT validated this capability in advance of 1.2 Full System validation, and Required Assets Available (RAA) was declared September 2017.  AFGSC declared 1.2 Interim Fielding Authorization October 2017.

Aircraft Hardware Development: Development of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL per JASSM-ER requirements (for all 76 operational B-52H aircraft) and two GITA.

Software Development consists of a modification to existing aircraft SMO and weapon (JASSM and MALD) OFP software to allow for internal and external carriage and modification to ground-based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).

CRL Hardware Development consists of developing Group A-associated interface hardware and two Group B LRUs (power supply and power distribution box). Two CRLs were modified for Interim and three CRLs were modified for 1.2 Full system using RDT&amp;E funds.

Support Equipment consists of developing software updates to the existing MUSTANG to interface with the CRL and the development of additional ground handling support equipment, maintenance stands.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 1760 IWBU Increment 1.1 project will acquire software development and hardware design via a sole source contract to Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (DSS) in Oklahoma City, OK. Deliverables include updated J-series weapon SMOs (software), three prototype modified CSRLs, six LRIP assets, logistics support, ground and flight test support, and engineering drawings. The Increment 1.1 program procured the CRL modification kits via sole source to Boeing DSS, OKC for LRIP and Full Rate Production (FRP), LRIP Installations, and FRP. Installs of the kits were completed via Contract Field Team (CFT). 

Increment 1.2 Program has a sole source EMD contract to Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (DSS) in Oklahoma City, OK.  Deliverables include updated JASSM and MALD weapon SMOs (software), three prototype modified CRLs, logistics support, ground and flight test support, and engineering drawings. Upon completion of JASSM/ER OFP and SMO software coding, an interim capability of no less than 20 JASSM/ER [8 bay (power 4), 12 external] was validated thru DT/OT in FY17.  The 1760 IWBU Inc. 1.2 Full capability lifted the Inc. 1.2 Interim power restriction to allow for power of 8 JASSMs in the bay and integrate 8 MALD into the bay. The Increment 1.2 program will procure the CRL modification and aircraft kits for full rate production via sole source to Boeing DSS, OKC. The installs of the kits are planned to be completed via CFTs and PDM.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with data and voice communications capabilities, along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in net-centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes the following: new MFCDs, a digital interphone system, on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions, an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR), limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, e-mail and file transfers, and an Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink. 

As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5 Identification, IFF, etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT. In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers (using stimulate/simulate/computer-based training or a mix) to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the SIL for the WSTs. In order to assist PDM during after-install checkout and Barksdale AFB and Minot AFB units with maintenance checkout and operational training, a CONECT ground station is being developed. 

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. Funds may also be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continued engineering design of CONECT capability into the B-52 training systems. Began incorporating changes required due to updates in Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and crypto modernization requirements.  Incorporated/integrated CONECT with recurring updates of the B-52 software baseline.   As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to the IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade, Mode S/Mode 5 IFF, etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT. CONECT will update the existing trainers and/or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the System Integration Lab (SIL) and for the WST.  A CONECT ground station, is required in order to assist PDM during after-install checkout, and provide Barksdale/Minot units with maintenance checkout and operational training capability.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The GPS IU Upgrade program will provide increased throughput and memory capacity by replacing the current processor, static memory, and necessary associated electronics with a newer processor, more memory, and sustainable electronic packages. This program will replace six Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) which include combining three Circuit Cards into one Input/Output (I/O) CCA. The Backplane and Motherboard will require an upgrade to integrate the new CCAs: the Central Processing Unit / 1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics cards. The Input/Output CCA will combine the Discrete Inputs Analog, Audio Video (DAAV), Discrete Outputs (DOA) and Serial Busses functionality. This upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU. 

In addition the new GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements: Which include two Ethernet Ports and two connectors on face-plate for future growth. 

The GPS IU integrates GPS Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data into navigation, communications, and weapons systems on board the B-52.  The GPS IU acts as a controller for a MIL-STD-1553 data bus communications path.  The major areas of support include GPS interface control and monitoring, targeting pod functions, navigation displays for the Pilot and Copilot stations, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) control functions.

Originally developed with a 33MHz processor with 4MB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), the GPS IU has become overloaded as more software has been added to the B-52.  Currently operating at 86% throughput capacity and at 90% memory capacity, it is projected to exceed the designated safety threshold of 95% memory load by 2018.  The GPS IU is also facing parts obsolescence issues.  Studies show that the current spares will be exhausted by 2018.  The upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU.  The modified GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements.

GPS IU requires upgrading to incorporate any other GPS dependent capabilities on the B-52 platform.  B-52 fleet will have the capability to carry additional GPS dependent weapons and targeting pods, and the increased capacity to incorporate future GPS-dependent capabilities beyond 2018.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Radar Modernization Program (RMP) supports nuclear and conventional operations by replacing the current APQ-166 radar on the B-52H aircraft. The APQ-166 system will be increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the current failure rate of the APQ-166 places long-duration missions at risk. This modernization program will encompass the radar antenna array and up to 14 individual LRUs that comprise the entire radar system. Development, production and installation of new components and systems to replace the legacy equipment; to be installed on all 76 B-52H aircraft. RMP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire, to the maximum extent possible, previously developed Radar systems and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability of the radar system and the capabilities for new missions. This Radar Modernization Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons and to perform mission-essential navigation and weather avoidance functions. In addition, applicable training devices for the new radar subsystem must also be developed, modified and/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. 

This upgrade will affect all three Weapon System Trainers (WST), the WST Training Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), and both B-52 Offensive Station Maintenance Trainers (OSMT). As the RMP upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.), increased radar integration (advanced targeting pod, mission planning, open mission systems considerations, crew vehicle interfaces and Electronic Warfare System), as well as other aircraft upgrades (e.g., Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, GPS/INS, BSB, Re-Engine, EWS, etc.) may impact the RMP. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life/obsolete software/hardware within the weapons system and simulators systems enabling a move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative may also be required. Additionally, funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and nuclear/conventional mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program will include projects to facilitate future B-52 capabilities.  Scope of work may involve, but is not limited to, Avionics, Navigation, Situational Awareness (SA) and Defensive Systems.  Additionally, develop and integrate emerging technologies for specialized B-52 missions to include Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Targeting and Weapons. Continuing work related to the Mission Data Recorder to make the T-1 modification a Permanent Modification to the platform. Additionally, this funding also includes future prototyping efforts.  

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020, Project 675058, B-52 Weapon Sys Trainer Air Ref Training Upgrade was terminated.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The principal mission of the B-52 Training Systems program is to ensure high fidelity simulators and training systems are available for aircrew members to support credible training, maintain proficiencies, and increase skill levels. B-52 Aircrew Training Devices simulates the necessary visual, motion, and audible cues to provide ground training of Air Force Global Strike Command aircrew members. The B-52 Weapon System Trainer (WST) Air Refueling Upgrade is a comprehensive project that will allow B-52 Aircrew to accomplish credible air refueling training in the simulator, which minimizes the requirement for on-aircraft air refueling training. To facilitate this capability, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA),Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other Analysis or paperwork necessary to establish a program of record. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMSMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>B-52 CERP is a Middle Tier Section 804 program and not an MDAP.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP) supports nuclear and conventional operations by replacing the current TF33-PW-103 engine on the B-52H aircraft. The TF33-PW-103 engine is increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the AF Propulsion Directorate projects the engine will become unsustainable by 2030. This sustainment program will replace the current TF33-PW-103 engine with jet engines of similar size, weight, and thrust characteristics. The development, production and installation of new engines and related subsystems will replace the legacy equipment on all 76 B-52H aircraft. B-52 CERP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire engines and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability/maintainability of the propulsion system and produce additional electrical power generation capabilities for emerging requirements. The B-52 CERP will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons while saving fuel and extending the range/loiter capabilities of the aircraft. In addition, applicable training devices for the engine throttles and engine health monitoring subsystem must also be developed, modified and/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. This upgrade will also require corresponding modification of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  As B-52 CERP brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear hardening, cyber security, program protection, etc.) will also need to be addressed.  Several concurrent aircraft upgrades during the CERP may necessitate studies be performed during the program to determine optimal engine installation and deployment options.

Cost includes any other analysis or documentation and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 Weapon System.  Cost includes Program Management Administration (PMA) costs, centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>B-52 Airspace Compliance - Communication, Navigation and Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) upgrades are required to comply with increasing FAA requirements.  Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)Out upgrades to meet FAA mandate. ADS-B Out will also comply with Public Law 111-383-Jan 7, 2011, which mandates procurement of any Global Positioning System (GPS) after FY2017 must be capable of receiving Military Code (M-Code).

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AGM-86B, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), is a subsonic, air-to-surface strategic nuclear missile, operational since 1982.  Armed with a W-80 warhead, it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy's territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage. 

RDT&amp;E funds support development of new tests and evaluation procedures, software, and equipment.  RDT&amp;E funds also provide sustainment solutions for Line Replaceable Units (LRU) and technology insertion to ensure ALCM sustainability supports Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and Global Strike mission requirements through 2030.  Additionally, RDT&amp;E funds support aging and surveillance analysis to pro-actively identify components which will degrade system reliability.

The ALCM Test Plan Development and Evaluation program develops plans and procedures for testing nuclear systems, and implements those procedures as directed by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and to satisfy the recurring requirements to test Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) susceptibility.

An extensive Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) is in place to address age related issues and to ensure reliability and sustainability through 2030. Technology insertion is anticipated to address serviceability of components at or near end of life. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ALCM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Previously, the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) was assessed in the nuclear environment for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability for High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and Total Ionizing Dose at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). 

Follow-on test development will assess the neutron and gamma component in the nuclear environment for CBRN survivability. Test development and execution will utilize organic and contractor agencies. 

INE SLEP plans for a three phase reliability assessment with comprehensive plan to address short and long term supportability.
Phase 1 - Short-term parts shortage mitigation analyses with Tomahawk Reference Measuring Unit and Computer
Phase 2 - Definition of scope of efforts and establishing the manufacturing methodology
Phase 3 - Delivery of working engineering samples, certification of production, and production of INE's equal to the function and reliability of 'like new' devices</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-1B Lancer is a swing-wing, supersonic, long-range conventional bomber. It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the AF inventory. The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision (and non-precision) weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current structural service life extends beyond 2040.

The B-1B modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing.

FULLY INTEGRATED TARGETING POD (FITP)
The Fully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) modification permanently integrates the Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) capability into the B-1B's avionics flight software architecture and replaces the B-1B's Temporary T-1 Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) / Laptop Controlled Targeting Pod (LCTP) system with a digital, high-definition video-streaming targeting pod. This will provide increased B-1B aircrew situational awareness, weapons de-confliction, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) within the Combat Air Forces (CAF). FITP will provide robust combat targeting processing power, computing speed and throughput for aircrew mission planning, and a permanent sustainment support structure. It will provide all four crew members access to targeting pod information displayed on digital-quality video using the Integrated Battle Station (IBS), Multi-Function Displays (MFDs), and the cursor controller. FITP will address the aircrew ergonomic issues caused by the current system configuration, allowing more rapid prosecution of targets through improved integration with Avionics Flight Software (AFS) capabilities. In addition, FITP will provide growth capability for implementation and interaction with follow-on systems to augment targeting pod use. Furthermore, the FITP removes the need for an Interim Contractor Support (ICS) sustainment support structure, which will resolve DMS issues.

MODE 5/S AUTOMATIC SURVEILLANCE BROADCAST (ADS-B) OUT
B-1B Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/S is the replacement for the B-1B Mark XII IFF Mode 4. Mode 5 will provide secure target identification and will be a response system for combat identification. Mode Select (Mode S) and ADS-B Out provides timely aircraft position and flight path prediction to receiver units for aircraft, Air Traffic Control, and the Air Defense System . The IFF Mode 5 upgrade uses an automated system that responds to interrogations to avoid the loss of B-1B aircraft through fratricide. Mode 5 is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) mandate. Funds are included to accommodate the DoD mandate as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.

RADIO CRYPTO COMPLIANCE 
The B-1B Radio Crypto Compliance requirements originated to meet DoD mandates by a classified need date. If the requirements are not met, the B-1B is at risk of losing secure Line of Sight (LOS) and BLOS communication with ground and air forces. The Air Force is in the process of negotiating a short-term waiver to the mandate.  Without the radio crypto compliance the B-1B will not be able to participate in CONUS/OCONUS military operations. The program replaces the existing radios with crypto-compliant radios providing BLOS communications. Funds are included to accommodate the DoD mandate as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.

Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) - Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)
The B-1B Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) - Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) replaces the existing MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) 1 Link 16 terminal to meet National Security Agency (NSA) Crypto Modernization (CM) Device Cease Key and FAA Frequency Remap mandates: Current systems become non-compliant in 2025. MIDS-JTRS resolves all LVT 1 deficiencies and adds substantial combat capability enhancements to Link 16 Enhanced Throughput (LET) and Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN-4) with Concurrent Retention Receive (CRR). MIDS-JTRS also provides multi-datalink capability, improving situational awareness and allowing rapid in-flight retargeting in a cooperative combat environment. Funds are included to accommodate DoT/DoD-approved Frequency Remap and Crypto Modernization Device Cease mandates as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.

Bomb Rack Unit 56 (BRU-56) 
The Bomb Rack Unit 56 (BRU-56) upgrade will mitigate a safety risk present within the legacy BRU-56 ejector rack. The upgrade will alleviate the deficiency within the current ejector rack as well as add increased carriage capability. Prolonged use has resulted in a deficiency of the rivets within the linkage of the rack. This deficiency led to multiple failures, to include one Class A mishap in 2003, one Class C mishap in 2010, and multiple ground mishaps. The BRU-56 modification guards against future bomb rack mishaps and the possibility of a catastrophic aircraft loss as well as the loss of life.

GAP AND INTEGRATION ANALYSIS
Program funds cover engineering/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and the auxiliary equipment needed for development projects that have not yet been fielded. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. Costs includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs, total ownership cost, as well as initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts for improving weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, and reliability. All B-1B development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. Funding is also required to ensure test asset availability for testing of aircraft RDT&amp;E efforts. 

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-1B weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Fully Integrated Targeting Pod</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Fully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) Modification permanently integrates the Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) capability into the B-1B's avionics flight software architecture and replaces the B-1B's Temporary T-1 Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) / Laptop Controlled Targeting Pod (LCTP) system with a digital, high-definition video-streaming targeting pod. This will provide increased B-1B aircrew situational awareness, weapons de-confliction, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) within the Combat Air Forces (CAF). FITP will provide robust combat targeting processing power, computing speed and throughput for aircrew mission planning, and a permanent sustainment support structure. It will provide all four crew members access to targeting pod information displayed on digital-quality video using the Integrated Battle Station (IBS), Multi-Function Displays (MFDs), and the cursor controller. FITP will address the aircrew ergonomic issues caused by the current system configuration, allowing more rapid prosecution of targets through improved integration with Avionics Flight Software (AFS) capabilities. In addition, FITP will provide growth capability for implementation and interaction with follow-on systems to augment targeting pod use. Furthermore, the FITP removes the need for an ICS sustainment support structure, which will resolve the DMS issue.</r2:Description>

Mode 5 will provide secure target identification and will be a response system for combat identification. Mode Select (Mode S) and ADS-B Out provides timely aircraft position and flight path prediction to receiver units for aircraft, Air Traffic Control, and the Air Defense System. The IFF Mode 5 upgrade uses an automated system that responds to interrogations to avoid the loss of B-1B aircraft through fratricide. Upgrades to ADS-B Out and Mode S are required FAA mandates and the upgrade to Mode 5 is a JROC mandate. Failure to meet these mandates will result in delayed/denied service of controlled airspace within the US and Europe.</r2:Description>

If the requirements are not met, the B-1B is at risk of losing secure Line of Sight (LOS) and BLOS communication with ground and air forces. The Air Force is in the process of negotiating a short-term waiver to the mandate. Without the radio crypto compliance the B-1B will not be able to participate in CONUS/OCONUS military operations. The program replaces the existing radios with crypto compliant radios providing BLOS communications. Funds are included to accommodate the DoD mandate as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Bomb Rack Unit 56 (BRU-56) upgrade will mitigate a safety risk present within the legacy BRU-56 ejector rack. The upgrade will alleviate the deficiency within the current ejector rack as well as add increased carriage capability. Prolonged use has resulted in a deficiency of the rivets within the linkage of the rack. This deficiency led to multiple failures, to include one Class A mishap in 2003, one Class C mishap in 2010, and multiple ground mishaps. The BRU-56 modification avoids future bomb rack mishaps and the possibility of a catastrophic aircraft loss as well as the loss of life.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0101127F, project 675345, B-2 Expanded Strike, is a new start.

$13M in FY 2019 BPAC 676022 is misaligned in the database, funds are being executed within FY 2019 BPAC 675345.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, and support equipment development.

The Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines and reduce maintenance man-hours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand/low
density fleet.

The Adaptive Communication Suite (ACS) provides SATCOM connectivity for Command and Control enroute to the target with Airborne Mission Transfer and Beyond Line-of-Site Situational Awareness. This effort includes incremental improvements to the suite of B-2 ACS UHF communications system.

B-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to attack a wider array of target sets, to include hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. Upgrades includes Flex Strike, JASSM-ER integration and Expanded Strike.

The Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) program supports the B-2 ability to penetrate anti-access combat environments, performing missions directed by the National Command Authority while ensuring aircrew survivability. The LOSSM program reduces low observable (LO) maintenance, and stabilizes and improves the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet.

The B-2 Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) provides a more capable Flight Data Recorder (FDR) with increased capacity for storing Flight Information Data (FID) for recovery and use in the event of a mishap.

The Radar Aided Targeting System (RATS) is planned to be a software only solution implemented in several B-2 system level Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) to provide radar-aided enhanced targeting capability through weapon hand-off navigational updates for guided nuclear weapons in a non-GPS environment.

The B-2 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/S modification program provides new equipment to the B-2 for airspace compliance on a global stage. Mode 5 is a new, cryptographically secure mode used solely by the military, which is replacing Mode 4. Mode S is a secondary surveillance radar process that allows selective interrogation of aircraft using a uniquely assigned 24-bit address. 

The B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F,and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0101127F, project 675345, B-2 Expanded Strike, is a new start.

$13M of FY19 funding for LOSSM is misaligned into BPAC 676022 AEHF SATCOM, due to a database error.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, and support equipment development.

The Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines and reduce maintenance man-hours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand/low density fleet.

Modern communications are key enablers for the B-2.  B-2 cryptographic modernization updates cryptographic equipment for B-2 AIT/ARC-234, AN/ARC-211 and MIDS/LVT communication systems. The Adaptive Communication Suite (ACS) explores incremental improvements to the B-2 ACS UHF communication system in order to modernize the system and increase data throughput.

B-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to attack a wider array of target sets, to include hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. The Flexible Strike Phase 1 program will re-host the current B-2 stores management software onto a new integrated processor. Integration of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) weapon will further enhance the B-2's ability to attack and destroy high value target sets. The Expanded Strike program adds the Advanced 5,000 pound Joint Direct Attack Munition (A5K JDAM) and Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) to the B-2 arsenal providing additional armament capability for hardened, deeply buried targets.

The Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) program supports the B-2 ability to penetrate anti-access combat environments, performing missions directed by the National Command Authority while ensuring aircrew survivability. The LOSSM program reduces low observable (LO) maintenance, and stabilizes and improves the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet. This program encompasses multiple improvement projects including, but not limited to, improved LO materials (electrically conductive materials, adhesives, electrically resistive materials, radar absorbing material, fastener fills, coatings, welds, material removal tools, and improved processes), LO structures (radar radomes, antennas, hot trailing edges and tiles, intermediate section doors, tailpipes, windows, lib bay panels, leading edge, permanent fasteners, exhaust pockets, gust load alleviation system, inlets, radar absorbing structures, overall signature stability, and Alternate High Frequency Material expansion), and radio frequency (RF) diagnostic tools, evaluation systems, and other tools (Tier One Material Inspection System, Signature Diagnostic System, next generation Tier II and Tier III systems, Test Article 0998 optimization, conductivity probes, tailpipe inspection tools, LO-related special test equipment, data archival, and communications tools).

The B-2 Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) provides a more capable Flight Data Recorder (FDR) with increased capacity for storing Flight Information Data (FID) for recovery and use in the event of a mishap. The initiative includes replacement of the current CSMU with an adapted Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) replacement, modification of the Flight Data Recorder Processor (FDRP) to provide 28 vdc power to the new CSMU, modification of the FDRP Operational Flight Program (OFP), and addition of a Underwater Locator Beacon (ULB). The current CSMU/FDRP does not meet the minimum requirements specified in the Aircraft Information Program (AIP) reference documents (AFI 63-133 and AFH 63-1402).

The B-2 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/S modification upgrades equipment on the B-2 in order to ensure compliance in the global airspace. Mode 5 provides improved combat identification security, with better discrimination between closely spaced platforms, while reducing interference with civil Air Traffic Control transponders, enabling the B-2 fleet to accomplish its anti-access and global strike mission.  Mode 5 is the DoD standard for secure combat ID.  Mode S is a secondary surveillance radar process that allows selective interrogation of aircraft according to the unique 24-bit address.  Mode S provides improved accuracy and altitude resolution and reduced interference from closely spaced aircraft through selective interrogation of assigned transponder addresses.  

The B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification. Upgrades may include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Additional Training System Upgrades may also include efforts to implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

The Radar Aided Targeting System (RATS) is planned to be a software only solution implemented in several B-2 system level Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) to provide radar-aided enhanced targeting capability through weapon hand-off navigational updates for guided nuclear weapons in a non-GPS environment.  Funding supports timely software development, test and roll-out of software into a future B-2 OFP, specifically to support the B61-12 integration.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Baseline Support maintains and upgrades the B-2 unique flight test aircraft as well as hardware/software and test equipment to support developmental systems integration, and flight test, reducing the need for additional operational aircraft and accelerating deployment of advanced operational capabilities to the warfighter. Baseline Support also provides for other B-2 unique government costs and includes assorted studies of aircraft performance and cost trades as well as acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future aircraft, engine, weapon, communication, navigation or other capabilities.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MM Ground and Comm Equipment program replaces obsolete/unsupportable ground-based weapon system equipment located at Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and Launch Facilities (LFs) necessary to continue Minuteman III (MM III) operations through 2030. Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LGM-30G Air Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R), LGM-30G Automatic Switching Unit (ASU), LGM-30G Fast Rising B-Plug Service Life Extension Program (FRBP SLEP), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit (LCCB), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), and LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II).

MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities, and MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G Arm/Disarm Switch Replacement (ADSR) and LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3). These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to GBSD. As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.

MM Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete/non-serviceable weapon system support equipment. These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). Current efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as LGM-30G G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (G6B4 BER), LGM-30G Control Monitor Procedure Trainer Upgrade (CMPT), LGM-30G Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP), LGM-30G Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR), LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU), LGM-30G Simulated Electronic Launch Minuteman Replacement (SELM-R), and LGM-30G Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA BER).

MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Air Force Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2. It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring. These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 Launch Facilities (LFs) and 45 Launch Control Centers (LCCs).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MM Ground and Comm Equipment program replaces obsolete/unsupportable ground-based weapon system equipment located at Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and Launch Facilities (LFs) necessary to continue MM III operations through 2030.  Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LGM-30G Air Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R), LGM-30G Automatic Switching Unit (ASU), LGM-30G Fast Rising B-Plug Service Life Extension Program (FRBP SLEP), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit (LCCB), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), and LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>LGM-30G Air Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>ALCS-R will replace the legacy nuclear command and control system that provides the capability to launch Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) from an airborne platform, currently the Navy E-6B. The system consists of a nuclear hardened radio and MM III interface at each LF, and a suite of launch and cryptographic equipment that generates and transmits commands from the E-6B. ALCS-R is dependent on the Strategic Air Command Code Processing System for codes data supplied to airborne equipment, and the Navy E-6B radio Command, Control, and Communication data path to transmit signals to the LFs. The approved acquisition strategy will replace ALCS equipment by 2024 to resolve critical sustainment and cryptographic sunset issues and assure survivable, airborne launch capability for current and future ICBMs. ALCS-R will be designed for Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) airborne survivable launch platform capability maximizing investment across both ICBM weapon systems.</r2:Description>

The ASU is controlled by the MPP, which contains software and electronics to measure incoming and standby power characteristics. The DEU provides standby power in the event of a loss of the primary power source. Current equipment and lack of repair/reprogram capability causes inadvertent source transfers by the MPP. Technical data does not exist for repair or reprogramming of the MPP making it unsupportable. The ASU contacts have exceeded their service life, and unnecessary source transfers stress mission critical components. The increased power transfers have increased the use and accelerated the wear on the DEU.</r2:Description>

It will consist of Journal Memory Loader (JML), Floppy Disk Drive (FDD), Weapon System Control Console (WSCC) Printer, Oxygen Regeneration Unit (ORU), and with possible changes as requirements dictate.

All LCCBU efforts will support 45 operational LCCs, 12 trainers, 2 Integration Facilities, 2 Test Launch Facilities, and additional support and test equipment for maintenance locations.

The original development strategy was to retrofit production articles into the trainers. To ensure functionality and operational realism, the Program developed the trainer items in conjunction with the operational items making them trainer unique.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data. Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities, and MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls. Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G Arm Disarm Switch Replacement (ADSR), LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3), LGM-30G Ground Test Upgrade (GTU), and LGM-30G Squadron Data Simulator (SDS). These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program. MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>LGM-30G Arm Disarm Switch Replacement (ADSR)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The ADSR program designs, develops, fabricates and tests replacements for the aging Arm/Disarm (A/D) switches currently on the MM III Missile fleet. The A/D switch is responsible for completing or interrupting ordnance electrical circuits. A/D switches are placed at five key locations in the system: Interstage I-II, Stage II Liquid Injection Thrust Vector Control (LITVC) and Roll Control, Interstage II-III, PSRE Staging, and PSRE Isolation Valves. Aging and surveillance is an ongoing study to generate a tradeoff curve between reliability/availability and cost. 

Reliability/availability are monitored by periodic testing to discover unforeseen issues. Because all existing A/D switches cannot be repaired/refurbished, the number in inventory will eventually be inadequate to meet the need of the PDM cycle. Supply is estimated to deplete by approximately FY24 with repair/refurbish mitigation. Repair/refurbish is a reliable mitigation plan to meet the ongoing needs of the fleet while a manufacturer is selected and the manufacturing system is selected to develop a replacement A/D switch that meets requirements and production quantities through 2036.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The FT3 Program replaces the Mod 7 Instrumentation Wafer (Mod 7) and associated Signal Conditioner Monitor Group, and All Ordnance Destruct System (AODS) with a flight test kit. In addition, a replacement of the current Launch Support System (LSS) is required to deploy the flight test kit. The flight test kit which consists of the Flight Destruct System (FDS) and a wafer-less Integrated Instrumentation System (IIS), along with an upgraded LSS, will meet 30th Space Wing Range Safety and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) requirements and resolve obsolescence concerns.

The AODS, Mod 7 Instrumentation Wafer, and current LSS include many components that are not economically available, are no longer compliant with applicable Range Safety requirements, or are in need of technical modernization. Replacement of the Vandenberg Air Force Base flight test unique equipment is necessary to sustain future AFGSC Operational Test Launches (OTL) starting in FY22 based on current USSTRATCOM requirements.

The OTLs are critical to validating the continued accuracy and reliability of the MM III ICBM Weapon System and providing valuable data to ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent. The FT3 System of Systems (SoS) will perform the same function as the existing systems with upgraded design features in order to comply with Air Force Space Command Manual (AFSPCMAN) 91 710, Range Safety User Requirements, Range Commanders Council 319, Flight Termination Systems Commonality Standard, and RCC-324, Global Positioning and Inertial Measurements Range Safety Tracking Systems' Commonality Standard.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The G6B4 BER program impacts three stations: the G6B4 Rotor Balance Test Station, the G6B4 Hydrogen Fill Station, and the Gyro F-coefficient Station (GFS). The G6B4 Rotor Balance Test Station (S-133-18024) is used to determine radial and dynamic balance of the G6B4 gyro rotor after repair, and it needs to have the obsolete Schenk balancer and console replaced. The G6B4 Hydrogen Fill Station (S-133-132-4-384) is used to fill the G6B4 with hydrogen gas following repairs, and it needs to have obsolete and failing gauges, plumbing and valves replaced. The Gyro F-coefficient Station (GFS) (S-133-18038) is used to calibrate the F-coefficient of the G6B4 gyro after repairs are complete; it needs its obsolete hydraulic and electrical power systems replaced.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The current Communications Equipment Interface Unit (CEIU) is used to transmit MM III Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Performance Data (IPD) from MM III LCC to the Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) at the support base via telephone lines. The CEIU is unclassified equipment but interfaces with both classified and non-classified systems. The update will utilize more secure and reliable internet protocol transmission methods. The update effort consists of rewriting the CEIU imbedded software language using secure coding practices and changes the CEIU design from telephony to internet protocol. In addition, the PADS interfacing system is to be updated to interface with the updated CEIU design.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Air Force Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2. It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring. These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 Launch Facilities (LFs) and 45 Launch Control Centers (LCCs).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) program utilizes the ICBM Prime Integration Contract (IPIC) services of Northrop Grumman (NG), which were competitively awarded for the design and development of the ICU II capability. The contract type of the ICU II Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract is Cost Plus Incentive Fee. Also, ICU II EMD uses a separate contract for Nuclear Safety Cross Check Analysis/Performance Analysis and Technical Evaluation (NSCCA/PATE) Independent Validation &amp; Verification (IV&amp;V). This contract is driven by critical nuclear safety requirements to perform an independent assessment of all modifications to nuclear-certified software. The Support Equipment effort includes EMD development of depot support equipment, Guided Missile Launch Electronic Circuit(GMLEC) interface modification, and acoustic microscope system.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY 2018, PE 0101313F, Strategic War Planning System - USSTRATCOM, Project 675059, will be completed. 

The Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) is a USSTRATCOM system that must be capable of both deliberate and adaptive planning employing the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons. The planning system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

ISPAN Increment 4 will modernize the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS), that develops Joint Staff Level I through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements.  Increment 4 will fulfill MPAS requirements by reducing Crisis Action Planning and Time Sensitive Planning timelines, integrating nuclear and conventional kinetic weapon capabilities with non-kinetic effects, providing the capability to integrate planning and analysis capabilities of future Global Strike weapons, updating the MPAS system to provide the ability to train users in significantly less time, and leveraging new technologies to lower sustainment costs.  ISPAN Inc 4 is an evolution of the ISPAN Block 1 baseline system using proven technologies.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Worldwide Joint Strategic Communication efforts include Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems to include the Defense Injection Reception Emergency Action Message (EAM) C2 Terminals (DIRECT), Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE), the Strategic Emergency Action Transmission System (SEATS), the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), and the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS).  Funding may be used to modernize these, and other, NC3 systems.  Funding may also be used for research, testing, validation, certification, configuration management, and assessment of the Air Force NC3 Weapon System.   

SACCS is a dedicated, high speed, multi-level secure, data transmission, processing, and display system. SACCS provides the primary non-survivable command and control capability for receiving and disseminating secure Emergency Action Messages (EAM), Force Direction Messages (FDM), Force Status Reporting (FSR), and exchanging information type messages from USSTRATCOM. SACCS provides messages for effective deployment of strategic bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, mobilization aircraft, tanker support aircraft, and the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force.   

SACCS has equipment that has reached its end of life and is no longer repairable due to diminished manufacturing sources and parts obsolescence. This jeopardizes Air Force Global Strike Command's (AFGSC) ability to meet mission requirements as required by Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Nuclear Technical Performance Criteria and Operational Standards (CJCSI 6811.01). In order to mitigate the risk of SACCS inability to operate once the current spares are completely diminished, and ensure the system remains secure against modern/future threats, the Air Force is developing a replacement system.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NC3 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>ISPAN Increment 5 will modernize the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) that develops Joint Staff Level I through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements.  Increment 5 will fulfill MPAS requirements of Resiliency and Enhanced Consequences Analysis.  Increment 5 is an evolution of the ISPAN Increment 4 baseline system using proven technologies. MPAS Increment 5 will utilize AFLCMC/HBC software factory resources to enable developers to build and integrate software at the Top Secret level as part of the agile software development effort.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NPES weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F,0605832F, and 0605898F. 

In FY18, PE 11313F (ISPAN Inc. 4) efforts were transferred to PE 11324F (ISPAN  Inc. 5) as an evolution to ISPAN Inc. 4 baseline system.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics) (SAF/AQ) designated ISPAN Inc 5 as a FY 2016 NDAA Section 804 Rapid Fielding program and delegated Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to the Air Force Program Executive Officer (AFPEO) Digital.

Increment 5 will develop and modernize software for the combatant commanders using an Agile DevOps Continuous Delivery / Continuous Integration (CD/CI) acquisition strategy with development contracts that are negotiated and awarded in a competitive environment. The program will consider the best contract options to implement the Agile DevOps CD/CI strategy.  Other program management activities will be accomplished via Fixed Price (FP) contracts.  Other activities are also accomplished through the use of various contracting vehicles such as Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs). MPAS Increment 5 will utilize AFLCMC/HBC software factory resources to enable developers to build and integrate software at the Top Secret level as part of the agile software development effort.

The PEO is the AF PEO Digital. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) and the 55 CONS at Offutt AFB are the contracting authorities for ISPAN and provide contracts, legal, and financial management support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mk21A Reentry Vehicle (RV) program will design, develop, produce and deploy an integrated RV capable of delivering the W87-1 Warhead when released from the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). The Mk21A will provide needed performance and security enhancements over the Mk21 reentry vehicle to meet the upgraded requirements for the Department of Energy W87-1 warhead.  The Mk21A will also meet the requirements laid out in the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Capability Development Document (CDD) as directed by Air Force Global Strike Command.

The major activities in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase of the Mk21A RV program include: (1)Trade Studies; (2) Prototype designs; (3) Government systems engineering, analytics, and test capability development, (4) RV Risk Reduction, and (5) Weapon System (WS) Integration Risk Reduction. Reentry vehicle components include: high velocity nose tip, high impulse transducer, fuze, aero shell forward section, body section and rear cover, radio frequency subsystem with antennas, RV spin-up system, inflight disconnect cable and other electrical cables. The Mk21A program will include prime contractor development of applicable support equipment, data, flight test hardware, infrastructure, and training materials while examining and mitigating weapon system integration risks, and nuclear surety, hardness and certification and system vulnerability assessments.

This program element includes necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mk21A RV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Mk21A Reentry Vehicle (RV) program acquisition strategy is to deliver an integrated RV capable of delivering the W87-1 Warhead to target beginning in FY30. For the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, the Program Office will competitively award one cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract in FY19.  This contract will be for 36 months with a 12 month option.  The Air Force is responsible for developing, producing, and maintaining the Reentry Vehicle (RV).  The National Nuclear Security Administration develops/modifies the nuclear weapon inside the RV, including the Weapon Electrical System (WES), which is the firing set that interfaces with the DoD fuze.  

The objectives of TMRR for Mk21A are as follows: (1) deliver one preliminary design and two prototypes; (2) incorporate a modular, open systems architecture; (3) implement Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) enabling the government to Own the Technical Baseline (OTTB); (4) demonstrate performance of weapon system capabilities through prototyping, modeling, simulation, and testing; (5) conduct test flight of two prototype RVs in ICBM-like environment. 

The TMRR phase will include a System Requirements Review (SRR), System Functional Review (SFR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Prototype RV demonstrations. The contractor may elect to perform additional risk reduction testing on select components to further evolve the design during TMRR, in order to lower component integration risk during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. The reference design for the Mk21A includes use of Mk21 Mod 6 aeroshells.  Because the Mod 6 vehicles were originally developed as test vehicles for the legacy Peacekeeper ICBM, they must be modified for use as war reserve.  All RV subsystems must also be procured, including the High Impulse Transducer, Radio Frequency Subsystem, Antennas, Spin Generators, and cables.  

The TMRR contract will be a three year base contract plus a one year option potentially extending TMRR and test related activities through 3QFY23. After Milestone B approval, the EMD contract will be competitively awarded as early as 4QFY23.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The UH-1N Replacement program will replace the Air Force fleet of UH-1N aircraft with modern helicopters that will close significant mission capability gaps associated with the current fleet of UH-1N aircraft.  The replacement aircraft will provide vertical airlift and support the requirements of five Air Force major commands and operating agencies:  Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Force District of Washington, Air Education and Training Command, Pacific Air Forces, and Air Force Material Command.  AFGSC is the Air Force lead command and operational capability requirements sponsor.  This program is an element of the Air Force's nuclear enterprise reform initiatives.  

Program includes, but is not limited to, continued funding for four test aircraft and two System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) aircraft, support equipment, Interim Contractor Support (ICS), training system air vehicles and devices, Type I training and courseware, non-developmental item (NDI) integration, cyber test articles, associated Government support activities, and permits the initiation of activities to support rapid requirement development.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver UH-1N Replacement Program weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Regional/Sector Operation Center Modernization program supports the NORAD/NORTHCOM homeland defense and air sovereignty mission for fixed Air Defense Sectors.

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED (BCS-F): BCS-F is a bi-national development program with Canada. The BCS-F Program is an AF Homeland Defense battle management command and control system with the capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive air picture. BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space. This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression. 

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED MODIFICATION ONE (BCS-F Modification 1): BCS-F Modification 1 effort will integrate Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data feeds and Earth Center Earth Fixed (ECEF) into the BCS-F system.  ADS-B provides the BCS-F system the capability to ingest Global Position System (GPS) based location data, from ADS-B equipped aircraft, at the Air Defense Sectors.  Integration of ADS-B on aircraft flying in US airspace is mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by 2020. ECEF is a three-dimensional earth model that eliminates artificial boundaries in the two-dimensional BCS-F stereographic plane. ECEF also allows the ingestion and processing of sensor, target, track, and graphical data without compromising data accuracy due to translation errors.  The BCS-F Modification 1 effort will be executed as a Cooperative Development Program between the US and Canada.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BCS-F Modification 1 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F,0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, Ground Control Station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed on specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.
The MQ-9 Reaper system has four separate development programs. This PE includes:
1. MQ-9 Development and Fielding. This effort is for development and fielding of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft and GCSs and associated communications systems, sensors, payloads, simulators and support equipment as well as resolving Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.
2. Squadron Operations Centers (SOC). This effort is for development and fielding of standardized operations centers containing the equipment necessary for remote split operation, to provide mission data and tasking information to the aircrew and disseminate and/or exchange mission data with decision-makers and the intelligence community.
3. MQ-9 Upgrade. This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using an Agile Acquisition Strategy.
4. MQ-9 System Lifecycle Agile Modernization(SLAM). This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using an Agile Acquisition Strategy.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MQ-9 System Lifecycle Agile Modernization (SLAM) Program develops and integrates improvements for existing systems and fields new capabilities for the MQ-9 fleet through an Agile Acquisition Strategy to meet evolving mission needs.

The objective is to enable rapid fielding of new software, hardware, and sustainability for integration into the MQ-9 fleet with requirements from the Candidate Capability List (CCL) that may include, but are not limited to, efforts to reduce system configurations; perform technology upgrades; increase pilot awareness and usability; improve reconnaissance targeting and exploitation; expand weapons system selection and lethality; enlarge suitability to varying operational theaters; improve security and self-protection; reduce logistics footprint; train the warfighter and prototyping.

Activities also include, but are not limited to, studies, analysis, simulations, demonstration, prototyping and testing, use of subject matter experts and agencies in developing and testing MQ-9 system capabilities, to include System Integration Laboratory (SIL)/ Hardware in the Loop Laboratory (HILL) and Det improvements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) and Non-Recurring Engineering issues.

MQ-9 Program of Record (PoR)and Air Force Special Operations Command(AFSOC) will cost share during development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

New capabilities will include, but will not be limited to, upgrades of existing aircraft, Ground Control Station (GSC), communication, payload systems, and software updates needed to support new configurations and development, the addition of new capabilities and subsystems, as well as addressing and resolving Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

Candidate Capabilities are determined by Major Commands (ACC, AFSOC) direction and inputs that included Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) and Urgent Operational Need (UON) requests.  Approval of software/hardware content was established in FY 2018 based on current operational priorities.

Activities also include, but are not limited to, operator simulators, reliability and maintainability, test support, communications, and urgent services.

MQ-9 PoR and AFSOC will cost share during development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, Ground Control Station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed on specific aircraft and GCS configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.

The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties. The aircraft is designed to primarily prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) using a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill weapon capability (hunter-killer). It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).

The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capabilities to meet evolving mission needs through incremental upgrades, including but not limited to: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight; increasing operational range and endurance; propulsion system improvements; integrated redundant avionics; incorporating provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; communications upgrades to include but not limited to datalink encryption, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, secure voice and data communications; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; sensor/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); software updates needed to support new configurations and development; integrating additional precision weapons; and hardware and software upgrades to the GCS.  The program will also complete airworthiness and weapon system certification and accreditation; produce applicable training for payloads funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF), Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons). Development efforts will address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and safety issues. Activities also include, but are not limited to, trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.

The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support reach back Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to: perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; and enable personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status. It incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions. Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) is used for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within LOS range of the LRGCS. GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to other MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance/certification and accreditation requirements. 

This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools. 

MQ-9 Program of Record (PoR) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will cost share during development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.


Funding may be used to address DMS and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) issues.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

(GA-ASI), L3Comm, and Raytheon as the prime contractors. GA-ASI is the prime contractor for aircraft and ground control stations. GA-Mission Systems (GA-MS) is the prime contractor for Lynx SAR. L3Comm is the prime contractor for the Predator Satellite Link. Raytheon is the prime contractor for the MTS-B EO/IR sensor system. Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through an acquisition strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process. This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SOC is required to employ Remote Split Operations (RSO). It provides the communications, network, aircraft control and sensor distribution circuits to effectively execute RSO missions. The SOC provides CONUS-based aircrews mission data, tasking, and ability to disseminate and exchange mission data with decision-makers and intelligence entities. This effort defines component standards, develops and stands up a SOC Systems Integration Lab (SIL), and integrate new technologies to maintain currency with technological and platform advancements. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Since 2004, MQ-1/MQ-9 squadrons have acquired equipment, on an ad hoc basis, to provide the communications, network, aircraft control and sensor distribution circuits needed to execute RSO missions. OPAF funding will be used to standardize and modernize existing RPA SOC capability, which is required to reduce security vulnerabilities, as well as address end of life/end of support issues of existing RPA SOC equipment. The Developmental Testing (DT) SOC will be used to further enhance the program's ability to update future RPA-SOC modernization efforts.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MQ-9 Upgrade Program develops and integrates improvements for existing systems and fields new capabilities for the MQ-9 fleet through an Agile Acquisition Strategy to meet evolving mission needs.

The objective is to enable rapid fielding of new software, hardware, and sustainability for integration into the MQ-9 fleet.  Per the Candidate Capability List (CCL) signed on 19 July 2018, capabilities may include, but are not limited to, efforts to reduce system configurations; mitigate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) through planned tech upgrades; enable airspace integration; increase weather tolerance; train like we fight; enable airborne situational awareness; enable ops in a contested environment; build open architecture, reduce logistics footprint; improve cybersecurity resilience, improve reliability and maintainability, increase lethality, improve human machine interface to enhance user experience; and improve readiness to prepare for tomorrow's war.

Activities also include studies, analysis, simulations, demonstration, prototyping, and testing, use of subject matter experts and agencies in developing and testing MQ-9 system capabilities, to include System Integration Laboratory (SIL)/ Hardware in the Loop Laboratory (HILL) and Detachment 3(Det 3) improvements. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) and Non-Recurring Engineering issues.

MQ-9 Program of Record (PoR) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will cost share development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Develop and integrate upgrade capabilities in support of the MQ-9 Upgrade Strategy.  Development will combine the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process.  New capabilities include, but are not limited to, upgrades of existing aircraft, Ground Control Station (GSC), communication, payload systems, Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS-B) and software updates needed to support new configurations and development, the addition of new capabilities and subsystems, as well as addressing and resolving DMS issues.

Candidate capabilities are determined by Major Command (Air Combat Command (ACC), AFSOC) direction and inputs that included Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) and Urgent Operational Need (UON) requests.  Approval of software/hardware content was established in FY 2018 based on current operator priorities.

Activities also include, but are not limited to, operator simulators, reliability and maintainability, test support, communications, and urgent services. 

MQ-9 PoR and AFSOC will cost share development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Program funds Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) Mounted, Dismounted, and Fixed systems. CREW devices are self-protection systems critical to Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle mounted, Explosive Ordinance Disposal dismounted and Entry Control Point operations. Includes integration of the devices into currently fielded systems.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A-10 concept of operations requires a flexible, adaptable and survivable weapon system to conduct close air support (CAS), combat search and rescue (CSAR) and special operations missions. The A-10 must conduct around-the-clock air operations under various weather conditions against numerous and varied enemy threats.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, A-10 Thunderbolt Advanced-wing Continuation Kit (ATTACK), Central Interface Control Unit (CICU); accommodate technology insertion (Additional Gigabit Ethernet capability, High Resolution Display System (HRDS), 3-D Audio, On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), and fulfill FAA and other mandates (IFF Mode-5, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) Out, M-Code, NSA Crypto Modernization/ARC-210 radio/Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)) to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness, Anti-Jam Embedded Global Positioning System within the provisions of 10 USC 2244A.

Operational Flight Program (OFP) development addresses evolving and continuing user requirements that must be incorporated in the aircraft software in order to employ advanced weapons (SMART Triple Ejector Rack (TER), increase situational awareness and enhance targeting capabilities as they become available. The funds budgeted continue regular OFP suite development efforts.


The RDT&amp;E funds provide A-10 Developmental and Operational Testing ensuring all added capability meets safety and airworthiness criteria. FMT's DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.


This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver A-10 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Breaking J Hooks/damaged 1760 cables were initially identified in 2009 during the PE program. A-10 SPO East contracted Lockheed Martin Owego to develop a solution. The design was successfully put through DT at Eglin AFB. OT was subsequently conducted for 30 days, dropping >100 munitions with no defects noted. A-10 SPO has no documentation from OT. J-Hook T-2 Modification was shut down and the design shelved. This J-Hook modification design is now government property.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier fixed-wing, high performance, single engine multi-mission fighter aircraft that comprises 50% of the AF fighter inventory.  Operational since 1980, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions, such as, offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies to meet emerging warfighter requirements and combat current and evolving enemy threats.  

Modification programs include: Operational Flight Program (OFP) development required to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to meet DoD mandates and keep the F-16, the respective training simulators, and other hardware subsystems current; Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which is a two-phased RDT&amp;E effort, includes a Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to increase Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective); EMD Hardware/Advanced capability improvements require funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence; Modular Mission Computer (MMC)Upgrade/Display Generator Upgrade resolves shortfalls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability addresses cyber-security and includes Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground/flight test for fielding; F-16 Training Simulator updates enable the USAF to exercise/train using the most current F-16 OFP available to all block configurations, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers; Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) on F-16 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and flight test; Comm Suite Radio Upgrade (CSU) improved satellite communication (SATCOM) radio upgrade with Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capability to meet next-gen tactical narrowband SATCOM with better crypto capabilities; an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar capable on all blocks that offers advanced electronic protection capabilities as well as improved reliability and maintainability on F-16 aircraft; MIDS JTRS provides a real-time, jam resistant and secure information system for the transfer of combat data, voice and navigation information between widely dispersed battle elements; Hybrid Flight Control Computer (HFLCC) Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS)  development and integration prevents most controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents using terrain database and prediction algorithms for aircraft trajectory recovery and executes an automated fly up maneuver to avoid collision; Advanced Identification Friend or FOE (AIFF-Mode5)on F-16 aircraft provides improved airspeed and location info to ground stations and other equipped aircraft in vicinity; Digital Radar Warning Receiver improves on existing radar warning receiver performance and improves Electronic Warfare (EW) threat detection range, azimuth, detection time, and allows reduction of radio frequency compatibility issues with other on board transmitters.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-16 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F-16 Program acquisition strategy is to improve capability, maintenance and safety mods through OFP development/flight test, enhanced weapons integration, structural upgrades, and simulator concurrency.

F-16 OFP SW updates will continually bring new capabilities to the warfighter. OFP SW development effort is now completely developed at Hill AFB (309 SMXG). Numerous Integration contracts (CPFF, FFP) are required to allow for Improved Avionics, Weapon, ADS-B, MIDS JTRS integration to successfully field with each OFP.
MMC Upgrade awarded to Raytheon on 22 Nov 2016. PDG Upgrade awarded to General Dynamics Mission Systems on 17 Apr 2017.
The EMD HW/Advanced capability improvements will develop, test, and qualify aircraft weapons systems, including subsystems and uses various contract types (Cost Plus and Fixed Price).

The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) contract for development and production of the APG-83 radar awarded to Northrop Grumman 31 May 2017. The US Government is the prime integrator and a separate contract is in work for Lockheed Martin to provide integration support.

AIFF Mode 5 Out program uses numerous contracts for DMS resolution, integration, production, support and installs. Funding will be awarded on the following contacts: harness IDIQ, Bracket IDIQ, Falcon 2020, Mode 5 IDIQ, and SASSM/EGI IDIQ.

Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS) development will accomplish test and evaluation of the AGCAS system on F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft. Contracts are expected to be awarded by the end of 2018 with LM, flight test, and engineering contractors.

DRWR is organically being integrated on the F-16 by F-16 System Program Office (AFLCMC/WWM) and the Electronic Warfare Avionics (EWA) group at AFLCMC/ WNY, Warner Robins AFB, GA. The ALR-69A production contract (managed by AFLCMC/WNY) was awarded on 30 March 2018 to Raytheon, Goleta, CA (CAGE CD 06129). The ALR-69A software is organically managed by AFLCMC/WNY utilizing the 579 SMXS (Software Maintenance) team and the OEM Raytheon, Goleta, CA. The ALR-69A hardware is sustained by the 408 SCMS (Supply Chain) and 402MXW (Hardware Maintenance) group at Warner Robins AFB, GA.

Flight Test requires both organic test range support and various contract support for integration test of F-16 subsystems to ensure capabilities meet CAF fielding schedule, which includes Radio Frequency (RF) compatibility.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today. The F-15C/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record. The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep-penetration, and night/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, a refresh of older F-15C/D aircraft with the F-15EX and upgrades to newer F-15C/D aircraft and F-15E aircraft (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology. Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Heads Up Display (HUD) and Heads Down Display, instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system. The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and/or phased technology/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. This includes technical and acquisition-related studies to ensure F-15 lethality and survivability beyond 2040.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program
funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F,
and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0207134F, project 670131, F-15EX, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A refresh of the F-15C/D fleet is critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Older F-15C/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF-only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C/Ds are beyond their service life and have SERIOUS structures risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time-consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C/D is 35 years old with over 8,300 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure.

ADCP II develops a common mission computer for the F-15C and F-15E.  The current mission computers of both platforms have reached their limits of speed, memory and throughput.  Additionally, digital systems have changed the security requirements of both platforms and the older mission computers cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirements. A common mission computer is expected to reduce future development and long term maintenance costs.  The program will also develop a new F-15C cockpit display to replace an obsolete one. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

Mode 5 enables the NSA-mandated Mode 5 encryption and anti-jam for Air-Air Interrogator (AAI) and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems.  The Mode 5 program will remove, upgrade, and then replace the existing APX-114 and APX-119 on all F-15 aircraft in order to add Mode 5 capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Development funds for F-15C/D and F-15E fleets are executed organically in support of equipment improvement, study, analysis, and test. Acquisition and management strategies for each program are independently developed and use a variety of contract methods and types to accomplish program objectives.

At this time, the F-15EX acquisition strategy is pre-decisional since it has not been approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA). However, the F-15EX design will be based on the F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF-only capabilities like the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. Since these systems are all projected to be mature when required for integration in the F-15EX, the acquisition strategy is deemed low risk. To rapidly field the F-15EX, the USAF plans to authorize long-lead procurements shortly after contract award, and focus engineering activities on ramping up the production line capacity and integrating existing systems. Test activities will likewise be tailored to focus on integration of F-15QA, EPAWSS, and the Suite 9.1 OFP, taking appropriate credit for previous USAF and FMS testing. Finally, logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This program, BA 7, PE 0207134F, project 676020, F-15E Data Transfer Module II, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These development efforts include F-15 Radar Enhancements Electronic Protection (EP) capabilities, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, Flight Testing, Infrared Search and Track (IRST), Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint Technical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS)and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)/Second Generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO(SATURN).  Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

The Radar Enhancements (EP) will upgrade the digital Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar capabilities to counter sophisticated electronic threats.  Prior OFP's introduced EP into the C/D-model fleet. Initial EP capability for APG-82(V)1 equipped E model aircraft took place in Suite 8E. Suite 9 and beyond will add additional EP capability to both the F-15E and F-15C. 

For the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software and hardware upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line allows the Air Force to release software upgrades approximately every 2 to 3 years.  At any one time, there will normally be three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort. 

Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C/D in a radar-contested environment.

Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)/Second Generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO(SATURN) will provide Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capable Air Force F-15C/D/E aircraft the ability to communicate on the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) constellation in support of a NORTHCOM Airspace Control Alert (ACA) requirement. SATURN will replace the Have Quick II and comply with the NSA lease key mandated dates.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) provides Air Traffic Control position and other secondary surveillance data and must be installed on all CONUS aircraft by 2020 IAW FAA mandate. 

Data Transfer Module II (DTM II) is an upgraded replacement for the obsolete and outdated data transfer device currently in the F-15. DTM is 30 years old and out of storage capacity. DTM II will provide improved mission planning capability, updated interfaces, replace an aging map system, and meet growing security requirements.  

ALQ-128a will replace the legacy ALC-128 design and includes development and integration of a re-designed ALQ-128a Electronic Warfare Warning Set (EWWS).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Manned Destructive Suppression (MDS) program funds the development and sustainment of the Air Force's Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) capabilities. The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50/52 and Block 40/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MDS system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The HTS R7 Software Update Program (SWUP) is underway to keep the HTS pod capable in a growing threat environment. The SWUP 3 Risk Reduction (RR) contract was awarded in Dec 15 as a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract type. This development effort will complete in Feb 19. 

The SWUP 3 Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) and SWUP 4 RR contract is planned to award in Mar 19 as a CPFF contract type and is a 36 month total effort. The SWUP 3 EMD portion includes plans for two releases to the field, Builds A and B. The SWUP 4 RR portion will mature candidates for future software builds by addressing findings from the field, incorporating requested improvements from the warfighter, and implementing other software changes to keep the HTS pod as effective as possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor provides air superiority to the Joint Force, access in the highly contested operational environment, as well as homeland and cruise missile defense for the next 40+ years. The F-22 is a multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines low observability, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable air superiority aircraft. The program is continuing planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities. The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, navigations, pilot systems, and electronic warfare.

The F-22 Raptor's Modernization Development is conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-22 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor provides air superiority to the Joint Force, access in the highly contested operational environment, as well as homeland and cruise missile defense for the next 40+ years. The F-22 is a multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines low observability, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable air superiority aircraft. The program is continuing planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities. The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, navigations, pilot systems, and electronic warfare.

The F-22 Raptor's Modernization Development is conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Update 6 (U6) Interoperability, is an Operational Flight Program (OFP) update providing cryptographic updates required by the National Security Agency (NSA) to Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), Link-16, and Tactical Secure Voice (TSV) to maintain interoperability with Link-16 and secure voice networks.   The U6 Interoperability program builds upon the development work already accomplished in the KOV-20 Cryptographic Modernization Program and integrates that development into a single OFP for fleet release.  In addition, U6 Interoperability will correct other software deficiencies previously identified during operations. The F-22 Update 6 Program is conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Budget Program Activity Code focuses on delivering Link 16 and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capabilities to the F-22 Raptor.

Link 16 will deliver Link 16 Transmit and enhance existing Receive capabilities. Link 16 capabilities will be enabled by Open System Architecture (OSA) and enables 5th generation F-22 fighter aircraft to transmit tactical information through datalink to the 5th generation F-35 (a.k.a. 5th-to-5th), as well as to 4th generation aircraft (a.k.a. 5th-to-4th). Transmitting tactical data to other aircraft types via datalink is a top Air Force priority. With Link 16 Transmit, the F-22's superior 5th Generation sensor suite will critically support the situational awareness of all participants in the operational environment.  Mode 5 IFF will deliver IFF Transpond and Interrogate capabilities. Mode 5 IFF is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council-mandated Blue Force identification capability that improves Raptor survivability and reduces fratricide risk DoD-wide.  Mode 5 IFF brings significantly enhanced combat identification in both quality and security.  All capabilities will be fielded on the F-22 Block 30/35 combat coded F-22 fleet.

The F-22's Link 16 and Mode 5 IFF developments are conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The LTO provides maintenance, staffing, and operation of 18 development labs including five unique major SILs: the AIL, RaIL, ACS, and VSS. The F-22 CTF located at Edwards Air Force Base conducts full-up weapons system testing to assess the effect of the F-22 combined characteristics of stealth speed, maneuverability, and integrated avionics upon mission accomplishment. The CTF uses operationally significant ground and flight test scenarios to identify system performance deficiencies of Link 16 and Mode 5 IFF early before they are more difficult and costly to resolve. The F-22 Raptor's Lab and CTF are conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as Agile and Lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor program to develop, test, and field software/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program will develop and field an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike aircraft for the United States Air Force, United States Navy, United States Marine Corps and International Partners countries. There are three variants: the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing variant; the F-35B Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant; and the F-35C Aircraft Carrier suitable variant. Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize total air system life cycle costs. Planning and pre-development systems engineering for Block 4 continues as Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is met for each variant during System Development and Demonstration (SDD).

Beginning in FY 2020, Continuous Capability Development &amp; Delivery (C2D2) efforts designated as Block 4 that are not USAF-unique (US Service and International Partner common requirements) are requested in PE 0604840F. Remaining funding in PE 0207142F supports USAF-unique on-going User Information Data Exchange Service (UIDES), Seek Eagle, Hybrid Product Support Integrator (HPSI) and Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) requirements. These continuing efforts are not new starts.

JSF C2D2 efforts provide incremental warfighting capability improvements to maintain joint air dominance against evolving threats. Requirements designated as Block 4 include a robust weapons integration portfolio and provide new opportunities for International Partners to assess, integrate, and field unique capabilities based on global sovereign requirements. Additionally, the F-35 JSF Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A to have the capabilities and provisions for DCA operations in the first post-SDD block upgrade. DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons. DCA operations for the F-35A is internal carriage of up to two B-61s. Due to extensive certification requirements, the DCA capability planning and design, testing and certification will continue throughout Block 4. Funding in this PE will resource the following F-35A DCA activities: development, analysis, test, integration, certification and risk-reduction activities necessary to field and maintain F-35A DCA capabilities throughout post-SDD block upgrades; assessment of DCA weapon integration and certification impacts on the JSF aircraft; identification and mitigation of potential technical and cost risks; definition of integration and certification trade-space to field the DCA capability with the B61-12 weapon; follow-on risk reduction efforts to ensure future integration alignment with the earliest feasible post-SDD block upgrade; full integration efforts pending Service decisions. This is not a new start effort.


The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) is the AF organization chartered to perform the compatibility mission and manage the compatibility enterprise.  AFSEO delivers warfighting capability through aircraft/store compatibility testing and evaluation and provides accurate combat weapon delivery and mission planning software.  Beginning in FY20, the USAF will support FTI wiring and weapons integration tasks related to SEEK EAGLE requests.  These tasks include, but are not limited to, envelope expansion, mixed loads testing, and adding additional stores. This is not a new start effort.

The F-35 HPSI's primary role is to integrate support across the supply chain, maintenance, sustainment engineering, logistics information technology and training disciplines. It will deliver enduring, global support for fielded F-35s while preparing for future force expansion.  USAF only will fund additional PMA to transition to a final HPSI, which will support sustainment analysis with product support managers, focused on long-term strategic planning and transition to a final integrated support plan. This is not a new start effort. 

USAF F-35 UIDES provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - UIDES that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views and systems to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft, the ability to feed F-35 training and operations data to ALIS, and support modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support operations planning, pilot and maintainer training, and depot data configuration and integration requirements. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program/project planning and execution and future program/project planning.  This is not a new start effort.


This program element does include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-35 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) is the AF organization chartered to perform the compatibility mission and manage the compatibility enterprise.  AFSEO delivers warfighting capability through aircraft/store compatibility testing and evaluation and provides accurate combat weapon delivery and mission planning software.  Beginning in FY20, the USAF will support FTI wiring and weapons integration tasks related to SEEK EAGLE requests.  These tasks include, but are not limited to, envelope expansion, mixed loads testing, and adding additional stores.

USAF F-35 UIDES provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - UIDES that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views and systems to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft, the ability to feed F-35 training and operations data to ALIS, and support modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support operations planning, pilot and maintainer training, and depot data configuration and integration requirements.

Modernization efforts are the Requirements Decomposition of capabilities for the entire Block 4 upgrade to include Sub-blocks 4.1 and 4.2.  This is a continuation of the previous Block 4 Requirements Decomposition effort which will include activities leading up to a successful test and evaluation.  Included in Block 4 are upgraded capabilities and continuous improvements to maintain Air System viability against evolving threats indicated in the Electronic Warfare Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization ICD, and the Block 4 Capability Development Document (CDD), reduce life cycle cost, and improve operational suitability.  Expected completion of a Block 4.1 Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and a Block 4.2 SRR will address additional Block 4 capabilities requirements.  Post-PDR risk reduction, preplanning for subsequent Block 4 Modernization events, and investments to deliver the full Block 4 Air System capabilities are included.  

Beginning in FY20, the USAF unique ALIS User Information Data Exchange Service (UIDES) requirement will be broken out separately from the remaining systems engineering. USAF F-35 UIDES provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service (UIDES) that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views and systems to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft, the ability to feed F-35 training and operations data to ALIS, and support modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support operations planning, pilot and maintainer training, and depot data configuration and integration requirements.

                                <r2:Description>Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) continues to deliver the core logistics infrastructure requirements for the F-35 enterprise.  ALIS includes features such as aircraft scheduling, training delivery and record keeping, technical data delivery, supply chain management, maintenance management, pilot and maintenance debriefing and mission planning.  The ALIS development program is focused on two primary lines of effort:  current ALIS which includes Agile DevOps and ALIS Next.  

Current ALIS is focused on developing new software that uses the current software as a baseline.  Upcoming software releases include 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 builds.  The required new capabilities have been defined by the US Services and include cybersecurity updates, decentralized maintenance, Prognostic Health Monitoring (PHM), Training Management System upgrades, Personnel Flight Equipment (PFE), Low Observable Health Assessment System (LOHAS), Corrosion Management System, squadron resource sharing, and new propulsion capabilities.  All aspects of ALIS software are included in current ALIS development.  The software development will have applicability to the Standard Operating Units (SOU) Central Points of Entry (CPE), and the Autonomic Logistics Operating Unit (ALOU) for both classified and unclassified hardware.  Under the umbrella of current ALIS, an Agile DevOps pilot is working to rapidly deliver capability updates to the fleet and change the way that current ALIS delivers software.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This is a joint program with no executive service. Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force and currently resides with the Air Force. 

Program Element 0604800N/0604800M continues USN development efforts budgeted in 0603800N prior to FY2002. The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Norway are participants in the SDD phase of JSF.

PE 0604810M/N ends in FY18 and continues in PE 0604840M/N as budget moves from BA05 to BA07.

PE 0207142F common Block 4 requirements moved in FY20 to PE 0604840F to separate USAF unique requirements.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C2D2 acquisition strategy is to employ both Cost and Fixed Price Incentive contracts for the Block 4 engineering and development efforts. A new modernization contract structure will be established for all post SDD Block 4 efforts. In addition, a separate Basic Ordering Agreement or Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract is planned to provide a long term approach to upgrading and maintaining laboratories and test aircraft and supporting technology maturation for future C2D2 capabilities. The F-35 Acquisition Strategy is currently being updated to add a section regarding C2D2.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 Hybrid Product Support Integrator's (HPSI's) primary role is to integrate support across the supply chain, maintenance, sustainment engineering, logistics information technology and training disciplines. It will deliver enduring, global support for fielded F-35s while preparing for future force expansion.  USAF only will fund additional PMA to transition to a final HPSI, which will support sustainment analysis with product support managers, focused on long-term strategic planning and transition to a final integrated support plan.

Funding for HPSI was previously programmed for in PE 27142F/BPAC 675346.  This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A variant to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons. DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of either one or two B-61-12 weapons.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort provides for the assessment of Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) weapon integration and certification impacts on the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft. It identifies and mitigates potential technical and cost risks, as well as defines the integration and certification trade-space to field the DCA capability with the B61-12 weapon. This effort also supports follow-on risk reduction efforts that will ensure future integration alignment with the earliest feasible post-SDD block upgrade, and is expected to include full integration efforts pending Service decisions.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCA effort will leverage contracting vehicles for the overall Block 4 F-35 C2D2 effort. The C2D2 acquisition strategy is to employ both Cost and Fixed Price Incentive contracts for the Block 4 engineering and development efforts. A new modernization contract structure will be established for all post SDD Block 4 efforts. In addition, a separate Basic Ordering Agreement or Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract is planned to provide a long term approach to upgrading and maintaining laboratories and test aircraft and supporting technology maturation for future C2D2 capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Funding in FY11 and beyond is for the Block II program only.  The AIM-9X Block I program costs for FY11 and prior are $233.583M.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AIM-9X Block II/II+ Sidewinder (AIM-9X Blk II/II+) continues the evolution of the AIM-9 series of missiles. This missile program delivers a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive Infrared (IR) energy to acquire and track enemy air targets and complements the radar guided Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The missile provides first shot, first kill opportunities while conducting basic fighter maneuvering (dogfighting) Within Visual Range (WVR) which is essential for aircrew survival. The AIM-9X provides these opportunities with unmatched offensive and defensive capabilities against threats WVR, even when IR countermeasures are employed.  The AIM-9X also provides air superiority in the Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air-to-air battle.  Anti-tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  The AIM-9X Block II missile is critical for projecting power and winning decisively against threats identified in Defense Planning Guidance and the Navy's Navigation Plan.

AIM-9X is a Post Milestone C, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT-IC) joint service program led by the Department of the Navy.  The Block II program has completed independent operational testing and found to be operationally effective and operational/suitable.  The program achieved Air Force Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in September 2016 and received Full Rate Production decision in August 2015.  The first Full Rate Production Lot contract was awarded in September 2015.  This budget line will continue technical refresh of critical obsolete components, implement cost reduction initiatives, improve insensitive munitions performance, correct deficiencies, and increase capabilities through software enhancements, and conduct testing to ensure platform integration onto threshold US Air Force aircraft.

The USN &amp; USAF require additional quantities beyond the approved APB (Change 1: 31 Aug 2015); an update is in staffing for approval.

The AIM-9X Block I concluded in FY 2011 and all funding/quantity data in the documents are associated with Block II activities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AIM-9X weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force and Navy continue to develop improvements to the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) to counter existing and emerging air vehicle threats operating at high or low altitude, and having advanced Electronic Attack (EA) capabilities.  The development program also enables AMRAAM compatibility with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities, and investigates new variants and/or alternate missions that may use AMRAAM attributes.  The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation; two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility; and incorporates new guidance software that improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness.  Operational Testing (OT) was completed in Jul 14 and the Air Force and Navy authorized operational fielding in Jan 15.  The Navy declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in Jan 15 and the Air Force declared IOC in Jul 15.  The program continues to address aircraft integration efforts to maintain compatibility/performance of the missile with changes occurring on threshold AMRAAM platforms per the Capability Production Document (CPD).  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible and address findings from the field, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs, and/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AMRAAM weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Guardian Angel (GA) is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization program.  GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.

Funds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR), Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Recovery, Oxygen Systems, Medical Monitoring, Aerial Insertion, Information Management (including Preservation of the Force and Family (POTFF) Tracking System), and the Battlefield Air Operations Kit. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes and associated engineering support to posture the GA program for technology insertion. The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, requirements development and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum.  This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions,to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Guardian Angel weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.
.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Guardian Angel (GA) program will address warfighter immediate needs to standardize, modernize, and develop additional capability for the weapon system used by Combat Rescue Officers and Pararescuemen. The program will also address future requirements for the weapon system that will encompass the needs of all three GA career fields.  

The GA program is an incremental evolutionary acquisition effort in which requirements are fullfilled through further sub-system development and integration.  These are being identified through updates to the Core Function Support Plan and GA Concept of Employment by HQ Air Combat Command.  The program has been divided into phases to more rapidly meet the user's immediate need to standardize and modernize the weapon system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force TENCAP increases warfighter effectiveness through the exploitation of national capabilities and promotes cross-domain integration of these capabilities into military operations/training and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities.

AF TENCAP exploits existing air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR) for operational and tactical applications by rapidly prototyping and providing capability demonstrations. Projects are designed to transition to warfighters or national intelligence agencies for operational use, and to appropriate acquisition Programs of Record for sustainment and further development. AF TENCAP projects influence the design and operation of current and future air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and NTISR systems while providing situational awareness to warfighters, national intelligence agency organizations, and units.

The program consists of multiple small projects supporting one of the Air Force Core Function Mission Areas (CFMAs). Projects are executed to provide continued support to Special Operations Forces and the warfighter, with impacts at the national, operational, and tactical levels.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF TENCAP capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Projects are selected based upon needs identified by the program's customers - DOD Departments, Combatant Commands, Components, MAJCOMs, and/or National Intelligence Agencies. Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via AF TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements. The U.S. Government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, sustainment and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by AF TENCAP.

AF TENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. AF TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program teams to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue the following segment which mitigates cost and schedule risk.

Contracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability. ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver precision attack weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>COMPASS CALL is the Air Force's wide-area, Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Command and Control Warfare/Information Operations (C2W/IO) weapon system.  The employment of this weapon system interrupts adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic attack system is capable of surgical denial and/or disruption of adversary Radio Frequency (RF) communications, radar and sensor systems.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through a series of incremental Baseline upgrades. The Baseline 2 (BL2) configuration and the mid-Baseline 2 (MBL2) enhancements are the latest in a line of mission system upgrades to the EC-130H. The BL2 configuration and MBL2 enhancements currently fielded have advanced COMPASS CALL's electronic attack capabilities significantly over the two previously fielded baselines. Baseline 3 (BL3) activities address new target-specific techniques, selective capability against advanced commercial communications, digital voice recognition and digital mission crew systems. Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack techniques and technology, COMPASS CALL was designed to be adaptable and must continuously modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies. Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority. The two COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS #1 and CCMCS #2) are upgraded per the mission system Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft. The Weapons System Trainer (WST) mirrors the capabilities of the fielded aircraft's cockpit avionics and communications equipment as well to ensure training provides the worldwide operational proficiency needed to comply with evolving Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) enhancements, parameters, and guidance.

The COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as Counter Radar technologies, Counter Communications, new target-specific techniques, new modern communications receiver technologies, further weight reduction, repackaged transmit antennas, the next generation of Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), and other classified hardware, firmware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new/emerging sensor developments. 

FY 2020 RDT&amp;E efforts will concentrate on Baseline 3 (BL3) and Baseline 4 (BL4) Prime Mission Equipment (PME) upgrades and integration.  The programmed BL3 upgrades will advance the PME capabilities as the FY 2020 development efforts address the evolving electronic attack requirement for the foreseeable future.  Obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade/enhancement as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  FY 2020 RDT&amp;E efforts include studies and analyses to support current program planning and execution including, but not limited to development efforts for future baseline capability planning to include low-band transmit capability, transition to open architecture and increased Software-Defined Radio (SDR) capability, subsystem upgrades, power expansion, transmit and receive development, Size/Weight/Power and Cooling (SWAP-C) reductions and Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) clip-ins.

Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during COMPASS CALL's prolonged commitment to overseas operations, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.

This program element may include necessary program management and administrative (PMA) costs and civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver COMPASS CALL capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority) to correct deficiencies, improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain engines throughout their service life.  

Changes in aircraft operational parameters caused by changing missions and tasks accelerate new engine problems; Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational. Engine CIP testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority) to correct deficiencies, improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain engines throughout their service life.  

Changes in aircraft operational parameters caused by changing missions and tasks accelerate new engine problems; Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational. Engine CIP testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F135 Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) supports F-35 single-engine fighter propulsion system.  It provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for the F135 propulsion system.  F135 CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), corrects service revealed deficiencies, improves system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability &amp; Maintainability (R&amp;M), reduces propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustains the propulsion system throughout its service life. Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the F135 CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems.  F135 CIP funding is driven by field events and type/maturity of the propulsion system, not by the total quantity of engines.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational.  F135 CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.    F135 CIP ensures continued improvements in R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&amp;M and spares costs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER), AGM-158B, continues the evolution of the JASSM Family of missiles. JASSM-ER provides a long range (over twice the range of JASSM Baseline/AGM-158A), conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft. The requirement is in the JASSM-ER Capability Production Document (CPD), dated 16 Apr 2010. Aircraft integration of JASSM-ER is complete on the B-1, F-15, and B-52. Objective aircraft are B-52, F-16, B-2, and F-15. JASSM-ER provides the capability to attack a variety of high value fixed or relocatable targets with precision, through preplanned missions or target-of-opportunity, deeper into enemy territory than JASSM Baseline (BL), minimizing the threat to launch aircraft. The Air Force developed JASSM-ER based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS). The program continues development/integration efforts on the Intelligent Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (ITIK), the Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF), the Military Code (M-Code) receiver, and Flight Termination System Telemetry Integration Kit (FTS-ITIK) batteries. FY16/17 studies led to modifying JASSM-ER to include survivability improvements that enhance lethality and distance via Wing Replacement/Chine Development/Integration and Warfighting Capability Enhancement (Software) to improve performance against emerging threats. The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) increased the JASSM Inventory Objective by 48% which resulted in the monitoring of 13 subsystems for obsolescence. The program is also evaluating Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS).  Potential future efforts include Anti-Radiation Homing System (ARHS), improved Data Link capability for relocatable target attack, alternate payloads, improved Guidance Navigation Control (GNC), alternative FTS-ITIK power source evaluations, advanced JASSM survivability, and a smaller warhead.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JASSM weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2020, PE 0207410F, Air &amp; Space Operations Center (AOC), Project Number 674596, AOC WS Modifications, effort Multi Domain Command and Control, was transferred to PE 0304115F, Multi Domain Command and Control (MDC2), Project Number 673380, Multi Domain Command and Control (MDC2), in order to improve transparency of development programs.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS) program element provides development of Command and Control (C2) capabilities across the entire spectrum of air and space operations from the strategic to the tactical level. There are three funded projects within the AOC WS program element:

AOC WS Modifications: Allows for the consolidation to a single baseline across the AOC WS enterprise utilizing FY16 NDAA, Section 804, Middle Tier of Acquisition for Rapid Prototyping and Rapid Fielding, as a rapid fielding effort to provide required modifications for the AOC WS to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integration, testing, fielding, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades. This includes utilization of Agile software development methodologies and managed cloud infrastructure and platform services. Modifications are required for the AOC WS to keep pace with evolving Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) components, integrated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, changes in the underlying Information Technology (IT) environment, as well as to deliver effective operational capabilities for the user.

Applications Development: Provides worldwide operational level C2 capabilities, which include: air battle planning, management, and execution; operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (C2 of IAMD); in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.

Unit Level: Provides both scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions of future Air Battle Planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AOC WS, Applications Development, and Unit Level capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020, PE 0207410F, Air &amp; Space Operations Center (AOC), Project Number 674596, AOC WS Modifications, effort Multi Domain Command and Control, was transferred to PE 0304115F, Multi Domain Command and Control (MDC2), Project Number 673380, Multi Domain Command and Control (MDC2), in order to improve transparency of development programs.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations. The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign. The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents. The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

In FY 2020, funding increased to support additional development capacity required for AOC WS Modifications and to enable the retirement of Theater Battle Management Core System - Force Level (TBMCS FL) and the legacy AOC 10.1 system while enabling an extensible cloud-based Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS/PaaS) hosting platform. Also, AOC WS Modifications are required for the AOC to keep pace with evolving COTS/GOTS components, DoD directives, changes in the underlying IT environment, and to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integration, testing, fielding, training, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades to the AOC WS. This includes utilization managed cloud infrastructure and platform services. Additionally, in FY 2020 AOC WS Modifications activities evolve the AOC utilizing Agile Methodologies, including Extreme Programming (XP) models, and embracing DevOps relationships to foster improved capabilities in support of mission requirements at Geographic and Global (formerly Functional) AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units, keeping the AOC current and interoperable with the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), cyber requirements, and next generation weapon systems/weapons. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AOC WS capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy builds on agile development and modification of existing capabilities using evolutionary acquisition to standardize and modify the AOC WS. The initial capability was AOC WS Increment 10.0, which fielded the 10.0 configuration to five operational sites, plus a Help Desk and a Formal Training Unit. The second increment, Increment 10.1, upgraded these locations to an integrated baseline and fielded the baseline to additional operational and reserve units worldwide. The AOC 10.2 sought to evolve the AOC to a Net-Centric environment compliant with DoD Services Oriented Architecture standards but proved late to need using legacy approaches, so the contract was terminated in July 2017 and Program of Record was canceled in January 2018. AOC WS Modifications will utilize FY16 NDAA Section 804, Middle Tier of Acquisition for Rapid Prototyping and Rapid Fielding, leveraging commercial best practices of Agile DevOps to scale out a modern virtual private cloud to the AOCs and scale up additional software product teams in support of retiring Theater Battle Management Core System - Force Level (TBMCS FL) and other legacy mission critical applications allowing for eventual disposal of the AOC 10.1 infrastructure. Using Sec 804 authority, time lines are reduced by modularizing both the development work and the associated contracting and funding strategies. This enables dynamic resource allocation based on current warfighter needs. The desired end state is continuous delivery of all AOC WS software.

AOC WS Modifications will leverage the AOC WS Long-Term Modification and Sustainment (LTM&amp;S) contract which will provide for government led integration of the AOC WS enterprise. AOC WS Modifications will also use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to adopt commercial best practices for software development and to scale out a modern Infrastructure as a Service/Platform as a Service (IaaS/PaaS) solution. Activities are also accomplished via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR). Additionally, significant technical expertise will be sought after via modular contracting approach and provided by Government Agencies, DoD Laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), Academia, and Engineering &amp; Professional Acquisition Support Services contractors as well as commercial industry partners.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire and modify segments of Air Force's (AF) Command and Control (C2) capabilities and services. Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies. These efforts focus on support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other AF and Joint Services C2 systems. Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013). These activities include C2 Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012). C2AOS-C2IS creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest. C2AOS-C2IS also develops and matures modular net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions. These applications include Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); the remainder of the CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems - Force Level (TBMCS FL) functionality; services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a JC2 Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

No FY 2020 funding requested; FY 2020 project efforts are detailed in PE 0305015F, C2AOS-C2IS.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Applications Development capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project funds are used to develop and integrate Command and Control, Incident Management, Emergency Response Application (C2IMERA; formerly Unit Command and Control [UC2]) as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support the execution of the air battle plan and the air tasking order message received from the AOC. C2IMERA operations software systems meet needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline System Requirements Document (SRD), and AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, by providing both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing, group and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future air battle planning. C2IMERA is fielded to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Crisis Action Team (CAT), and many other work-centers.    

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

No FY 2020 funding requested; FY 2020 project efforts are detailed in PE 0305015F, C2AOS-C2IS.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Unit Level capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER (CRC)

The CRC is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations to provide direct command and control to all air assets in an assigned Area of Responsibility (AOR) and to report back to the Joint Force Air Combat Commander (JFACC). The CRC is a family of systems which include: AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), AN/TSC-147, AN/TRC-213/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS), and the AN/TPS-75 Radar, CRC's organic radar. Air Combat Command (ACC) CRC Capability Road map provides for the modernization of this family of systems and will be programmed into phased updates through 2037.

CRC is part of an ABMS initiative to give capability to ingest GMTI data. CRC FY20 development efforts that will support ABMS efforts include an AN/TRC-213/214 RRSVS radio modernization upgrade, a Multiple Source Correlator Tracker (MSCT) software upgrade, and incorporation of a Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) tracker into the CRC. In FY19, these efforts fell under one thrust known as Phase 2. For FY20 and out, these efforts will be broken out with individual AML names and, therefore, the efforts will no longer collectively be referred to as Phase 2. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

The FY2020 funding request was reduced by $1.305M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program, BA 7, PE 0207417F, project 67411L, E-3 AWACS GPS Upgrade (M-Code), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission: E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) is the premier airborne platform providing Battle Management (BM)/Command and Control (C2) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.

1. E-3 DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON):  DRAGON completes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene BM/C2. DRAGON replaces the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Additionally, the acquisition of DRAGON flight simulators also contains DMS efforts which include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber resilient. The simulator effort also implements requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. DRAGON will provide development of support and test equipment needed for DRAGON production; DRAGON will also provide initial DMS and Initial Contractor Support (ICS) needed to support the first US developmental test aircraft (i.e., D-1) prior to the contract award of the DRAGON production effort. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON was being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.

2. E-3 Electronic Protection (EP): EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement. EP will replace the radar controller, exciter, receiver, and data processor in the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system. The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the battle manager's display and is intended to provide APY-2 radar quality to the entire U.S. AWACS fleet.  

3.  E-3 Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI):  TSI provides continuing management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) and Production infrastructure and tracking and monitoring the AWACS vendor's core mission and aircrew training, support equipment and program Government Furnished Property. The overall DT&amp;E test infrastructure supports development, production, and sustainment projects and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, WA, Baltimore, MD, and Oklahoma City, OK.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) projects on a maintenance fee basis, not limited to projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) AEW&amp;C efforts. Key programs include contractual management of the AWACS Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) integrated with the Block 40/45 Functional Group configured lab and the AWACS Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF). These labs provide US, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and international customers with a configured development and qualification system and subsystem environment supporting all AWACS system and radar development and sustainment.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. 

4. E-3 Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR):  C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system. These efforts also include but are not limited to investigation, analysis, and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of materiel solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization &amp; Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as materiel solutions for the user needs.  C2ISR will also support an analytical comparison of the operational effectiveness, suitability, and life-cycle cost of alternative materiel solutions beyond the current AWACS that satisfy an established capability need identified in an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).

5. E-3 Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC):  IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a medium-bandwidth Internet Protocol (IP) communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare. IPEC will provide a reliable IP-enabled communication capability to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time-sensitive targets. The modification will provide a permanent Inmarsat-based IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for increased bandwidth Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and multi-domain networks.  IPEC was originally planned for accomplishment as a traditional acquisition program, but due to warfighter demand, the effort has been re-classified as an Urgent Operational Need (UON). 

6. E-3 Combat Identification (CID) DMS:  AWACS' current CID capability is based upon 1960's era technology that has become unsustainable, and requires an update to retain a significant part of AWACS overall mission capability.  AWACS will address C2 CID shortfalls with a modern, persistent Airborne Moving Target Indication (AMTI) BM/C2 combat ID.  CID DMS supports the kill chain and decision superiority.

7. E-3 Communication Network Upgrade (CNU):  CNU will provide a Link 16 capability with high-jam-resistance, high-speed, crypto-secure computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of military platform from Air Force fighters to Navy submarines.  The current 20 year old Class 2 terminal has sustainability/DMS issues and does not support mandated Crypto Mod (CM) &amp; Freq. Remap (FR).  CNU resolves DMS issues, provides CM &amp; FR, Link 16 enhancements &amp; growth for Next Gen Tactical Data Link (TDL).  Risk reduction activities are being executed in cooperation with foreign partners.

8. E-3 Mode 5 Acceleration: Updates flight deck to address known Air Traffic Management restrictions; upgrades the current flight deck transponder to include the Mode 5 capability since DRAGON's IOC 2020/FOC 2027 does not meet the Mode 5 mandate. This subset accelerates the Mode 5 transponder FOC independent of DRAGON. In previous budget cycles, this effort was referred to as E-3 Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) Out Acceleration, which included both ADSB Out and Mode 5 Acceleration.

9. E-3 AWACS Communications Integration Program (ACIP): ACIP will provide Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and Second Generation Anti-Jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO (SATURN) capability by replacing the existing Have Quick II and DAMA SATCOM radios with new radios capable of communicating via the existing and additional military waveforms as a combined integration program on AWACS. Provides continued compatibility with US and Allied forces using frequency hopping UHF in support of airborne AMTI &amp; BMC2 to COCOMs for Joint, Allied &amp; Coalition ops by maintaining compatibility with CAF / Sister service C2 nodes and theater assets.

10. E-3 AWACS GPS Upgrade (M-Code):  The GPS M-code upgrade provides E-3G AWACS with robust capability to operate in evolving GPS jamming environment. Incorporates GPS M-Code capability into E-3G. As well as provides continued capabilities in GPS jamming environment in support of airborne AMTI &amp; BMC2 to COCOMs for Joint, Allied &amp; Coalition ops. We are compliant with OSD/NII mandate (2006), Public Law 111-383 and FY11 National Defense Authorization Act. In FY20 we will be using the AWACS software integration facility to inform the GPS M-code with the DRAGON upgrade.
 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-3 AWACS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The modernization of the AWACS weapon system consists of multiple capability upgrades that are developed and fielded on competitive and sole source contracts. Full and open competition is explored for all new efforts where market research indicates opportunities exist.  

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for PEO Digital (AFLCMC HB) is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for all AWACS Programs, with the exception of the E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade. The E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade MDA is the Secretary of the Air Force, with authority delegated to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) [SAF/AQ]. Of note, E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade has completed development activities, so it has no 3600 funding and thus not otherwise referenced in this document. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AWACS portfolio and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller Support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal (JTC TRS) Program, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for Battlefield Airmen, to include Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) operations, Special Tactics Combat Control Team (CCT) Air Traffic Control (ATC), Assault Zone operations, and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) operations.

JTC TRS is essential to provide initial training, mission qualification training, continuation training, and currency control requirements to JTACs and Special Tactics personnel. JTAC control training requirements exceed the ability of live-fly aircraft to meet, and JTC TRS is the only capability enabling JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required training for both qualification and proficiency in accordance with the U.S and Partner Nation Memorandum of Agreement for JTAC certification and qualification.

The JTC TRS Program provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards. Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers in a live-virtual-constructive network. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires integration. The simulator will supplement live field training and live-fly sorties to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment.

b. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/Special Operations Forces (SOF) Command and Control (C2) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for each ASOC/SOF crew position to execute the air tasking order.  

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.  DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the JTC TRS weapon system capability.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JTC TRS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>a. The JTC TRS acquisition is a single step to full capability as defined in the CPD. A small business set-aside competitive lowest price technically acceptable source selection was conducted and resulted in the award of a single contract to produce and sustain JTC TRS.  The contract includes pre-priced production options for additional JTC TRS production, Emulated Military Equipment (EME) program management, cybersecurity support, Contractor Logistic Support (CLS), Training System Support Center (TSSC), training, relocation, a legacy system compatibility study and an Air Traffic Control upgrade.  The pre-price production options include credit to the government for use of existing equipment when updating current fielded active duty immersive JTAC training systems (Air National Guard (ANG) Advanced JTAC Training System (AAJTS)) to the JTC TRS baseline. The contract structure allows for maintaining concurrency, implementing system improvements/technical refresh, and other modifications as required.  JTC TRS awarded a competitive contract in January 2016 to procure up to 32 devices.  The JTC TRS received a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision in February 2017 and is currently fielding production units.  . Development will be required for engineering changes related to Legacy System Compatibility, Air Traffic Control (ATC), TACP-Close Air Support System (TACP-CASS) and Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II).

b. The acquisition strategy for the JTAGSS trainer will be to field advance technology demonstration units to continue to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete JTAGSS development, deployment and integration. Current software is Government or Commercial Off-the-Shelf technologies (GOTS/COTS) allowing almost any training technology development company to compete, which lowers technical risk, schedule risk, and cost.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of Combat Air Intelligence Systems (CAIS) is to process, analyze, and disseminate intelligence for air component and unit operations worldwide by providing key intelligence infrastructure and production capabilities for the supported and supporting forces with true backbone type of intelligence support for air operations and air support to joint operations. CAIS is focused on providing the intelligence infrastructure and funding to Air Force Major Commands, 
Intelligence, Cyber and Space Squadrons, Field Operating Agencies, and subordinate units.

Modernizations utilize Section 804, Middle Tier of Acquisitions as a rapid prototyping/rapid fielding effort to provide required modernization to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through software engineering solutions, integration, testing, fielding, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades. This includes the utilization of Agile methodologies and cloud environment providers with hosting equipment provided by the program. Modernizations are required to keep pace with evolving Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) components, integrated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, and changes in the underlying Information Technology (IT) environment, as well as to deliver effective operational capabilities for the user.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides support to personnel using Geospatial resources utilized in Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) databasing applications, technology exploration and refresh initiatives, geospatial imagery data management and dissemination architecture, geospatial information and services modernization, and enablers for intel and targeting capabilities. Provides support to the MAJCOMs to ensure requisite and available target intelligence and GEOINT tools for information directly available to warfighters.

The GEOINT information and service software program funds the Air Force Enhanced Geospatial Product Library (EGPL) which is currently fielded to all combatant command air components and subordinate units supporting global air operations. The EGPL provides digital GEOINT data to support mission planning, targeting &amp; intelligence in support of mission objectives.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Geospatial Intelligence weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>TACPs are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations.  These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Center (ASOC) TACPs, Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and dismounted Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. TACPs coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols 
 
The purpose of the Tactical Air Control Party - Modernization (TACP-M) program is to provide TACPs voice, data and video communications, targeting and battlefield awareness capabilities. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communication

The TACP-M program support includes addressing frequent TACP combat deployments that sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments.  The TACP-M program works closely with the Battlefield Airmen Office (BAO) program to procure dismounted equipment. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities. 

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in the following four major areas: (1) ASOC/TOC systems (used in fixed operations centers), (2) Vehicle Mounted Systems (used in TACP tactical vehicles), (3) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (4) Close Air Support System (CASS) software. 

CASS software provides advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by Dismounted JTACs, for vehicle-mounted systems, and for stationary systems used in operations centers. TACP CASS software enables digital data communications with joint Command and Control (C2) nodes, other TACPs, attack aircraft, and Army C2 and Fire Support systems. It includes interfaces with TOC, ASOC, and JTAC radios, and targeting devices. It also provides battlespace awareness capabilities needed to plan, request, coordinate, and control CAS in support of ground maneuver forces.  The CASS software interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems / nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). 

The software is in two versions: Dismounted and ASOC/TOC/Mounted (ATM).  Both software support a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-117G, AN/ PRC-148, AN/PRC-152A, AN/PRC-154, AN/PRC-158, AN/PRC-161, AN/PRC-163, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN/PRC-150C, AN/PRC-160 and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future).  Future upgrades are necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms.  CASS upgrades provide a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, and targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The key characteristic of the software will be the Open System, Modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new external devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements

Funding increases include support for Dismount and ATM software to address interfaces with new android dismount software, changes to Army fires support systems, changes to Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), updates for fielded versions, new joint Digitally-Aided CAS (DACAS) standards, and technical support to operators employing the software.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>TACPs are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations.  These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Center (ASOC) TACPs, Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and dismounted Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. TACPs coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols.  

The purpose of the Tactical Air Control Party - Modernization (TACP-M) program is to provide TACPs voice, data and video communications, targeting and battlefield awareness capabilities. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications.

The TACP-M program support includes addressing frequent TACP combat deployments that sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments.  The TACP-M program works closely with the Battlefield Airmen Office (BAO) program to procure dismounted equipment. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities. 

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in the following four major areas: (1) ASOC/TOC systems (used in fixed operations centers), (2) Vehicle Mounted Systems (used in TACP tactical vehicles), (3) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (4) Close Air Support System (CASS) software

CASS software provides advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by Dismounted JTACs, for vehicle-mounted systems, and for stationary systems used in operations centers. TACP CASS software enables digital data communications with joint Command and Control (C2) nodes, other TACPs, attack aircraft, and Army C2 and Fire Support systems. It includes interfaces with TOC, ASOC, and JTAC radios, and targeting devices. It also provides battlespace awareness capabilities needed to plan, request, coordinate, and control CAS in support of ground maneuver forces.  The CASS software interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems / nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). 
 The software is in two versions: Dismounted and ASOC/TOC/Mounted (ATM).  Both software support a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-117G, AN/ PRC-148, AN/PRC-152A, AN/PRC-154, AN/PRC-158, AN/PRC-161, AN/PRC-163, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN/PRC-150C, AN/PRC-160 and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future).  Future upgrades are necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms.  CASS upgrades provide a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, and targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The key characteristic of the software will be the Open System, Modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new external devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements. 

Funding increases include support for Dismount and ATM software to address interfaces with new android dismount software, changes to Army fires support systems, changes to Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), updates for fielded versions, new joint Digitally-Aided CAS (DACAS) standards, and technical support to operators employing the software.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Data Links (TDL), as a subset of the broader airborne network, are used in a combat environment to exchange information such as messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond-Line- of-Sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications. TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the data link to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions. TDLs are used by all service theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. 

TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situation Awareness Data Link (SADL), Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT). TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016F) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.

This effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball. TDLs keep all Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) platforms and data linked weapons current/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA / DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. Due to new/evolving Link 16 User identified Interface Changes Proposals (ICPs), studies and analysis will be performed to identify impacts to current and future systems, and to identify the required changes and impacts of implementing these new capabilities. The activities will include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver TDL weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program executes various types of contract types to provide technical expertise necessary to test, evaluate and provide recommended solutions to modernize C2 platform data links. The program delivers annual lab-tested software implementations of AWACS Link 16 ICPs. Additionally, the program participates in annual lab demonstrations that produce reports as required to assist with platform integration of Link 16 modernization efforts.

The E-3 Platform architecture utilizes a JTIDS Class 2H Link 16 radio with defined environmental and physical cabinet constraints. An Investigation Report (IR) was initiated to investigate the integration of an Ethernet-enabled CMN4 MIDS JTRS variant into the E-3 platform. A separate IR was issued to understand the dynamics of the L-16 enhancements and facilitate integration of new Link 16 capabilities onto the E-3 platform to ensure cross-service interoperability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>RDT&amp;E funding for DCAPES is misaligned at the BPAC level for Fiscal Year's (FY) 2018 and 2019.  Funding is reflecting in the DCAPES Increment 2A BPAC, but it will be executed against the DCAPES Increment 2B program.  The DCAPES Increment 2A program will not execute any RDT&amp;E dollars in FY2018 or FY2019.

Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) is the USAF system used to project air expeditionary forces. It enables the USAF to posture mission ready and equipped forces (organized in effects-based operational capability packages) to deliver air, space and cyberspace capabilities to Joint commanders worldwide. Technical requirements planned for Increment 2B include enabling the system to support Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key enabling as well as elimination of Social Security Account Numbers as the primary key for identifying Air Force military and civilian members by replacing it with the Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier.

DCAPES funding will be executed against capabilities packaged into agile development projects for multiple incremental deliveries based on the warfighter's priorities. Additionally, funding will be used to cover downward directed federal mandates.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the DCAPES system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F,  and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCAPES program successfully awarded the DCAPES Increment 2B Development Task Order for a one-year Base Period and four one-year Option Periods using the NETCENTS 2 Application Services Small Business Indefinite delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The period of performance started on 6 April 2015 and ends on 5 April 2020, given all option years are exercised. 

DCAPES is an Evolutionary Acquisition Program using an incremental development approach (DoDI 5000.02 Model 3) to develop capabilities over several increments. To support the rapid development and delivery of capabilities, DCAPES will transition from a waterfall approach used in Increment 2A to a hybrid agile acquisition strategy in which capabilities are incrementally delivered in time-phased stages based on warfighter priorities and adoption of key architecture and technology requirements as a trade-off for accelerated delivery and risk reduction.

The DCAPES Program Management Office (PMO) will utilize a mix of agreements (Service Level Agreements and Memorandums) with DCAPES interface partners. A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Capabilities Integration Environment (AFLCMC/HNIZ) to conduct software development and testing. Memorandums of Agreement with Joint Interoperability Test Command, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Command, and the 45th Test Squadron are in place and outline the test support required before fielding the system. 

The DCAPES Increment 2B requirements have been packaged into multiple discreet capabilities which will be developed in multiple smaller increments. Each capability will be developed using several builds and with one or more fieldings to satisfy the approved requirements within each package.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>RDT&amp;E funding for DCAPES is misaligned at the BPAC level for Fiscal Year's (FY) 2018 and 2019.  Funding is reflecting in the DCAPES Increment 2A BPAC, but it will be executed against the DCAPES Increment 2B program.  The DCAPES Increment 2A program will not execute any RDT&amp;E dollars in FY2018 or FY2019.

DCAPES Increment 2A delivered Air Force functional specific capabilities as well as technical changes necessary for the Air Force to migrate from a directly connected architectural relationship with the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) to one utilizing data services across the Wide Area Network (WAN).  This ‘Loose Coupling' solution enabled DCAPES to be interoperable with JOPES and at the same time significantly reduced interoperability costs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the DCAPES system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>DCAPES Increment 2A includes Loose Coupling between Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES) and Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES), Infrastructure Support, and Business Intelligence. Increment 2A also includes requirements definition, prototyping, development, testing, interoperability, sustainment, and service oriented architecture transition.

DCAPES Increment 2B includes Infrastructure Support, Business Intelligence, and the development of multiple War Fighter Capabilities; the Program continued execution of War Fighter Capabilities 1-3 during the FY18 President's Budget, War Fighter Capabilities 1-3 &amp; 6 during the FY19 President's Budget,and War Fighter Capabilities 1,2,4,5,6 during the FY20 President's Budget.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Increment 2A used the Waterfall approach to develop functional capabilities and maintain interoperability with JOPES.  The DCAPES program successfully awarded the DCAPES Development Task Order using the NETCENTS 2 Application Services Small Business Indefinite delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  This task order was used to close out Increment 2A. 

The DCAPES Increment 2A Program Management Office (PMO) utilized a mix of agreements (Service Level Agreements and Memorandums) with DCAPES interface partners.

The DCAPES Incement 2B program successfully awarded the DCAPES Development Task Order for a one-year Base Period and four one-year Option Periods using the NETCENTS 2 Application Services Small Business Indefinite delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The period of performance started on 6 April 2015 and ends on 5 April 2020, given all option years are exercised.

DCAPES Increment 2B is an Evolutionary Acquisition Program using an incremental development approach (DoDI 5000.02 Model 3) to develop capabilities over several increments.To support the rapid development and delivery of capabilities, DCAPES will transition from a waterfall approach used in Increment 2A to a hybrid agile acquisition strategy in which capabilities are incrementally delivered in time-phased stages based on warfighter priorities and adoption of key architecture and technology requirements as a trade-off for accelerated delivery and risk reduction.

The DCAPES Program Management Office (PMO) for Increment 2B will utilize a mix of agreements (Service Level Agreements and Memorandums) with DCAPES interface partners.A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Capabilities Integration Environment (AFLCMC/HNIZ) to conduct software development and testing. Memorandums of Agreement with Joint Interoperability Test Command, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Command, and the 45th Test Squadron are in place and outline the test support required before fielding the system.

The DCAPES Increment 2B requirements have been packaged into multiple discreet capabilities which will be developed in multiple smaller increments. Each capability will be developed using several builds and with one or more fieldings to satisfy the approved requirements within each package.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Description>Develop diagnostic detection systems to immediately record signals resulting from a nuclear detonation.  These event signature elements support weapon and event characterization analysis for the purposes of identifying the weapon classification, magnitude of the detonation (yield), and Reaction Time History (RTH) of the device.  The combination of these elements with radiochemical analysis enables analysts to distinguish between wide ranges of nuclear weapon designs and origin, supporting the national attribution assessment process.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in many different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Loads, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference (EMC/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.

In support of certification, the program recommends approximately 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS). SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft/store certification capability.

SEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I &amp; II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades, practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications. SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft. In addition, these funds further support capability development and weapons certification efforts required by Air Combat Command to achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC) for the F-35A. Likewise, these funds also support F-22A weapons certification efforts for emerging weapons and B-21 development for critical Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) milestones. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SEEK EAGLE capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

It includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commanders'.  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  Project 675135, Warfighter Readiness, includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT) and its follow on program Command &amp; Control Simulation Environment for Training (C2SET), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS). 


The program element also contains Project 674567, M&amp;S Foundations, the Air, Space and Cyberspace Collaborative Environment - Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS).  ACE-IOS is a federation of constructive models for the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is developed and operated by the Air Force Cyber Simulation Center (CSC) to support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises, tests and experiments.  The CSC provides cyber live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environments to support the development and fielding of offensive and defensive cyber capabilities for the AF, DoD, and national agencies.  This program also supports the DoD Training Transformation Initiative.

The FY2020 funding request was reduced by $1.672 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFMSTT and ACE-IOS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation Foundations (MSF) focuses on integrating foundational capabilities needed to improve the usefulness of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities derived from the Warfighter Readiness (WR) thrust.  The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  MSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated
with concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsals.

Air, Space and Cyberspace Constructive Environment - Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS) project is a federation of constructive models for the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is developed and operated by the Air Force Cyber Simulation Center (CSC) to support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commands battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises, tests and experiments.  

The CSC provides cyber live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environments to support the development and fielding of offensive and defensive cyber capabilities for the AF, DoD, and national agencies.  The CSC is managed by the 90th Cyberspace Operations Squadron, a unit of the 318th Cyberspace Operations Group, 67th Cyberspace Wing, 24th Air Force (AFCYBER).  The Distributed Mission Operations Center for Cyberspace (DMOC-C) is a subset of the CSC focused on training and exercising tactical cyber mission forces (CMF) and cyber service providers (CSP) and operational-level command and control, intelligence, and cyber planners and operators.  DMOC-C provides the ACE-IOS to support Air Force information operations.  DMOC-C, using ACE-IOS, directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  DMOC-C thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations covering cyberspace, intelligence and command and control activities as part of the constructive backbone of Air Force capabilities within DOD and coalition LVC environments. 

DMOC-C's development and integration efforts on ACE-IOS are imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  LVC environments today are used as one of the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  These efforts enable more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.

Authorization and Accreditation and Networthiness is maintained via the Information Technology (IT) systems Risk Management Framework (RMF) for seven classified systems and five supported cross domain solutions, which includes code and ruleset development, testing, and fielding, and meets AF Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) and AF Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) net worthiness standards and evaluations.

This program also supports the DoD Training Transformation Initiative.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available, tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter Readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

It includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands.  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  This presently includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT) and its follow on program Command &amp; Control Simulation Environment for Training (C2SET), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS). 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFMSTT and C2SET capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) -  The DMOC provides comprehensive Live, Synthetic, and Blended (LSB) simulation capabilities which prepare warfighters to conduct dominant operations in air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains for theater-level, full spectrum combat training for Air Force, joint service, and coalition partners.  The DMOC training capabilities reach 31 geographically separated Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology and capability studies/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution by:
 
1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various systems, tools, and simulators to incorporate ever-changing technology and emerging training requirements into DMO events, such as Virtual Flag (VF) and Coalition VF (CVF), to enhance the quality of warfighter training.  Activities include Environment Generator development, DMO Tool Development, and Simulator Enhancement.  DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Warfare Center-Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS).  The NGTS is the primary environment generator for both Blue and Red Air in DMOC White Force.  DMO Tool development includes: a)  DMOC Replay Tool (DRT) facilitates a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events;  b) enhancement &amp; improvement of the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Filter and the Doctor-J (Dr. J) tools to enable tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between disparate simulator and operationally fielded (i.e. live aircraft) communication formats;  c) Development of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) to improve damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises; and d) development of solutions for integrating Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events; and simulator enhancement efforts to incorporate Mission Package standards upgrades into the Control and Reporting Center (CRC) Simulation Package (CSP) to allow a real-world system to be used as a simulator when needed in DMO events.

2. Assessment &amp; Authorization (A&amp;A)/Software Certification:  The DMOC supports cybersecurity requirements definition, integration/test support, analysis, systems engineering support, A&amp;A of core systems, and support software certification.  The DMOC implements cybersecurity requirements and is working towards the application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include Cross-Domain Information Sharing / Multi-national Information Sharing (CDIS/MNIS) ruleset development, load sharing, and testing; integration and testing of various newly developed / updated systems such as the DMOC Replay Tool, Dr. J, DIS Filter, and the DMOC Battlespace; and support of Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) software certification.

3. Distributed Training Sites &amp; Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates up to 30 geographically separated LVC training locations and 50+ systems into LSB DMO training events such as VF and CVF by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into LSB DMO events each year based on higher headquarters and Combatant Commander's (CCDRs) emerging requirements.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $1.940 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC):

The DMOC supports AF/Joint/Coalition DMO and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) through the development and integration of DMO training and test events, networks, scenarios, and databases. Due to evolving modeling &amp; simulation technology, the DMOC is an on-going, evolutionary effort to keep pace with those changes by continuously developing/upgrading DMO environment generators, systems, and tools and ensuring integration/interoperability of new systems into DMO to provide the best warfighter training possible.

DMOC has the following two primary contracts that manage the acquisition, development, testing, and integration of DMO standards, training, modeling and simulation, cross-domain information sharing testbed, and exercises on AF/Joint/Coalition DMO networks.  Additionally, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs) are sent to other external organizations (i.e. NAWCAD and DMOC-S) to fund development of DMO tools that support DMOC efforts.

Infrastructure, Development, and Engineering (IDE) Contract: Develops/upgrades various DMOC tools, systems, and simulators that are needed to conduct DMO training events. Develops, implements, and tests technical solutions for the integration of sites/systems into VF, CVF, and other DMO events.  IDE is a firm-fixed-price contract.

Command and Control Technical Support Contract (C2TSC): Supports government by assisting with development of technical requirements for upgrades to various systems and tools that will be developed by the IDE contractor and then performs acceptance testing of the those products. Develops requirements for site/system integration of sites/systems into VF, CVF, and other DMO events. C2TSC is a firm-fixed-price contract.  The current C2TSC is scheduled to end on 25 Mar 19 with a follow-on contract scheduled to start on 26 Mar 19.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0207610F, project 671201, BACN Simulators/Trainers, is a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) enables tactical edge Joint and Coalition information interoperability via air, space, and surface systems, to include a Backbone Network for high capacity data transfer.  As requirements emerge, BACN will integrate new hardware and software capabilities that improve system performance, interoperability, availability and open mission system technologies.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, expansion of external time reference capabilities, Military GPS enhancements, integration of advanced antennas and waveforms, and assimilation of mandates levied on the BACN systems.  This effort will include an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that will develop and integrate Military GPS on the E-11A BACN platform. Military GPS is required for BACN fleet to fly in increasingly contested AORs. Safety of flight considerations, including performance, aircraft structural integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements will be addressed.  Efforts will include required non-recurring engineering and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, the development of simulators/trainers, development of training materials, and technical publications.

Execute the acquisition and sustainment of two (2) complete Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) Payload systems operation and maintenance training simulators and two (2) Payload Control Element (PCE) operations and maintenance training simulators.  The BACN Payload simulators are designed for replication of both the E-11A and the EQ-4B platforms with platform-dependent payload configurations; one simulator for each platform.  The PCE simulators will be specifically designed for both the PCE-Launch (L) configuration and the PCE-Mission (M) configuration.  This effort would include design of all trainers (E-11A payload, EQ-4B payload, PCE-L, and PCE-M), training materials, operations and maintenance technical manuals for the assigned trainers.

Execute risk reduction activities for development of future capabilities on BACN payload/aircraft efforts. 
This effort will including developing the data and publications needed for a Program of Record
This effort will include Acquisition Support Contractors


This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BACN capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) enables tactical edge Joint and Coalition information interoperability via air, space, and surface systems, to include a Backbone Network for high capacity data transfer.  As requirements emerge, BACN will integrate new hardware and software capabilities that improve system performance, interoperability, availability and open mission system technologies.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, expansion of external time reference capabilities, Military GPS enhancements, integration of advanced antennas and waveforms, and assimilation of mandates levied on the BACN systems.   Military GPS is required for BACN fleet to fly in increasingly contested AORs. Safety of flight considerations, including performance, aircraft structural integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements will be addressed.  Efforts will include required non-recurring engineering and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

This effort will include an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that will develop and integrate Military GPS on the E-11A BACN platform.

Execute the acquisition and sustainment of two (2) complete Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) Payload systems operation and maintenance training simulators and two (2) Payload Control Element (PCE) operations and maintenance training simulators.  The BACN Payload simulators are designed for replication of both the E-11A and the EQ-4B platforms with platform-dependent payload configurations; one simulator for each platform.  The PCE simulators will be specifically designed for both the PCE-Launch (L) configuration and the PCE-Mission (M) configuration.  This effort would include design of all trainers (E-11A payload, EQ-4B payload, PCE-L, and PCE-M), training materials, operations and maintenance technical manuals for the assigned trainers.

This effort will include an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that will develop a Deployable PCE.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BACN capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Military GPS is required for BACN fleet to fly in increasingly contested AORs.  Safety of flight considerations, including performance, integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements for long range reference, local area reference, and landing/terminal reference, are directly affected by how GPS sensors are used. 

This effort will include an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that will develop and integrate Military GPS on the E-11A BACN platform.

Deployable Program Control Elements (PCEs) are required to provide agile deployment support to establish remote and full ground control locations in a timely manner to shorten the kill-chain.

This effort will include an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that will develop a Deployable PCE.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the CSAF Title 10 wargaming efforts to test concepts, capabilities, programming choices, and plans using simulation and other techniques, otherwise known as wargaming.  Based on the Department and Air Force direction, there is a concerted effort in these periods of fiscal restraint to reinvigorate, institutionalize, and systematize wargaming across the Department.  This effort requires continued funding to maintain the level of effort to most effectively pursue an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources.  The Air Force continues to refine the wargame process and design to better integrate and synergize those efforts in support of the new Air Force Strategy, Planning, and Programming (SP3) process.  Specifically, in addition to maintaining a robust Title 10 Wargame series, Global Engagement, servicing Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) objectives. The HAF Wargaming Enterprise is executing on-call Wargaming in support of the AF/A5/8, the Agile series, along with quick-turning wargame support to the USAF Enterprise Capability Collaboration Team (ECCT) requirements, the Enterprise series,  Plan Blue, and to service AF/A5S strategy and concept development objectives; all to better address the requirements of the SP3 process and cycles.  Additionally, HAF Wargaming provides and coordinates Air Force representation at other Service and Joint wargames as they execute across the department.  These efforts are providing decision support to senior Air Force leaders involving investment strategies and develop concepts to best employ U.S. forces in future conflicts.

The Wargame Information Environment (WIE) is a continually evolving system that provides an array of services to game players which enables the accomplishment of game objectives.  The backbone of the WIE is GameNet, a deployable, standalone, Local Area Network (LAN) with servers and laptops that host applications to support virtual battlespace collaboration, decision making, three-dimensional visualizations &amp; mapping, and services.  Behind these applications are cutting edge technologies and database architectures from both commercial off-the-shelf and government developed software that assures relevance to the wargame.  The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently collaborate, make decisions, present those decisions, and execute moves within the wargame; documenting each step in the process.  This information capture enables discovery during the wargame and permits postgame analysis.  These findings inform portfolio rebalancing exercises, concept and strategy development, and very senior leader decision making.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In order to achieve an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources, wargaming requires an evolutionary acquisition approach for every wargame. Contract support is required as wargame and IT specialized expertise resides with industry and is not available organically.

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>- Increment 5 will be complete in 2019 with the final release recommendation for AMC platforms.  The remaining test events are paid with FY18 funds on contract.  The majority of work for Increment 5 was conducted in the MPS Modernization BPAC.  The Increment 5 BPAC was established for FY17 and FY18 only, in order to meet MAIS reporting requirements. The majority of the work for increment 5 was conducted in the MPS Modernization BPAC.

- MPS software is a layered software, designed with open architected standards and modular construction.  The core of the MPS software is the Framework software (FW) used by all MPS platforms and the Navy.  Common Components are distinct services that are used by a select number of platforms.  An example would be weapon specific capability that fighters share.  The Unique Planning Component (UPC) is the platform specific software and associated software (install etc) that is delivered to the users in the form of a mission planning environment.  Traditionally the MPS Systems Program Office allocates FW funding to other Platform Operational Flight program (OFP) development programs.  In FY20, will continue FW effort but will establish it as a independent program. This tracks with the Navy and affords greater insight into the framework cost elements.  The FY20  R-Doc will list FW as a separate program in the MPS Modernization BPAC.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.

The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for most Department of Defense (DoD) platforms. It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed- and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions. It replaces two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service, open architecture system, frequently referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue. MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft and are shared with the selected programs in the Navy. MPS delivers significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.

FY20 funding will allow continuation of the MPS Modernization project.  MPS will develop pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning capabilities for Air Force aircraft Global Positioning System (GPS) and weapons migrating from legacy mission planning systems to the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS),in addition to continuing support for new capabilities and updates for Air Force platforms/weapon systems that have already migrated to JMPS.  These platforms/weapon systems include, but are not limited to, the B-1, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, RC-135, and their associated weapons (e.g., Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), and Network Enabled Weapons (NEW). JMPS will support the development of follow on modernization efforts for MAFPS, SMACC CSAR (HC/MC-130, HH-60)and Global Mobility (C-5,C-17,C-130, KC-10, KC-135, KC-46) to be delivered with the final MPS Inc 5 software releases. 

In addition, FY20 funding will be utilized to continue the development of the Joint Precision Airdrop System- Mission Planning (JPADS-MP)system in conjunction with the Army. This program includes the JPADS-MP airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17, C-130 and other selected platforms as necessary and deliver a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions, as well as, precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery. JPADS-MP enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, and other data to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.

Finally, for MPS Increment 5, there is no FY20 development required as the final software delivery is planned for FY19.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.

This project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) capability in conjunction with the Army.  JPADS provides a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/ or standoff precision delivery.  It enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, while mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of exposure to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, and other data to accurately deliver payloads to U.S. and other friendly forces.

Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) is the key JPADS-MP software deliverable.  It will increase the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop.  Future initiatives are designated to achieve automation of airdrop planning and execution to reduce task saturation in the cockpit and support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) objective of moving to a two-man cockpit.  These efforts include the ability to automatically receive and use real-time winds in any location, calculation of a release point and airdrop in a single pass, the ability to conduct real-time objective area analysis to calculate probable damage estimates and execute dynamic re-tasking, the ability to conduct post-drop assessments, and the implementation of new technologies (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Touch Screen environment).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable. This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) to support the B-1, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, HH-60 other platforms, Framework (FW) and all Common Component (CCs) software tools for mission requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  MPS Modernization efforts are as follows:

1) CAF MPS Modernization:  These development efforts modernize CAF Mission Planning Environments (MPEs).  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc.  The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF modernization effort include, but are not limited to, B-1 (Sustainment Blocks 15, 16, 16a, 17, 17a and 18), F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9 and 10) and F-22 Increments 3.2B, 3.2M Release One, Release Two, and Release Three.  CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons including, but not limited to, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-II), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).  Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related JMPS MPE CCs, including Weapon Planning Software (WPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), GPS Crypto (including GPS M-code), Weather CC, etc.  CAF MPE Modernization includes, but is not limited to, the following platform efforts:

a. F-15 Modernization Phase II &amp; III:  This modernization program consists of multiple software development efforts driven by OFP updates for F-15 Suites 7,8,9,9.1, and 9.2. Suite 7-9 MPE capabilities include, but are not limited to, Data Transfer Device (DTD) improvements, updates for new features in weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb I and II (SDB I and II), AIM-9X, AIM-120D, and Network Enable Weapon support elements (e.g. key handling, weapon data link and Link 16).  It will also include enhancements to the synthetic aperture radar planning tool (SAR-PT) and the global area reference tool as well as radar modernization updates (e.g. combat identification, radar planning tool enhancements).  Development efforts for F-15 Suite 8 include, but are not limited to, integration of B61 Life Extension Program (LEP), feature updates for several weapons, and the expansion of Link-16 messages sets.  F-15 Suite 9 MPE will include a variety of updates and enhancements for weapons and aircraft systems to include, but are not limited to, Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), a new Advanced Dual Core Process II (ADCP-II) computer as well as Digital Transfer Device/Modules (DTD/DTM) modernization.

b. F-16 Block 40/50 Modernization Phases I&amp;II:  The F-16 Block 40/50 modernization completed fielding and transitioned to full sustainment the 2Q of FY17.

c. F-22 Modernization Phase I:  The F-22 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates v13.1, v14.0, v14.1, and v14.2.  These enhancements include, but are not limited to, the addition of improved capabilities for the AIM-9X and AIM-120D, the incorporation of additional electronic protection tasks, combat identification improvements, addition of an Inter-flight Data Link Gateway, Mode 5 IFF and Combat ID updates, Link 16 updates, and incorporation of the synthetic aperture radar planning tool.  Additionally, other new and emerging OFP-generated requirements will be addressed as identified by the operational user(s).  Other Common Component (CC) updates will also be completed as required.

d. B-1 Modernization Phase I:  The B-1 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates for Releases 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 11.0.  It will incrementally update the platform MPE and provide updates to the aircraft mission capabilities, including adding sensor anywhere on tactical display, updating threat range rings and route re-planning capabilities, improving Air Coordination Order (ACO) file loading and the memory utilization in the onboard avionics updates.  Additionally, it will migrate the B-1 MPE to a native 64-bit environment and utilize Mission Planning Data Service Layers (MPDSL) to modernize the software architecture. 

e. The platform efforts include work associated with updates to the framework and associated services.  Beginning in FY20 the Framework will be broken out as a separate program with a unique funding line. 

2) MAF MPS Modernization:  These development efforts modernize MAF MPEs for the KC-46 aircraft as well as all Air Mobility Command platforms initially fielded under MPS Increment 5.  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP), Global C2, and AMC fuel efficiency requirements.

3) The SMACC Modernization Program includes development, testing, and fielding of MP software for the E-3 DRAGON, E-3/E-8, RC-135 and EC-130. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) is providing a new JMPS capability to the HH-60 and MC/HC aircraft. The follow-on versions continue that development. 

4) MAF Modernization effort builds upon the fielded E-8 MPE to provide new and improved mission planning capabilities for the MAF fleet (e.g. C-5, C-130, KC-10, etc.) as required to meet OFP, fuel efficiency, and global planning net-centric requirements.  It includes, but is not limited to, enhanced capabilities to accommodate avionics upgrades, improved communications systems, interfaces with command and control systems, new parachutes, etc. for various MAF platforms. Development efforts also include, but are not limited to, integrating improvements to MAF related Common Components (CCs).  Examples of these CCs include, but are not limited to, MAF tools, such as Assault Zone CC and the Air Refueling Tool (ART) CC.  CSAR Release 1.1 program began in FY17 modernizing the efforts begun with the CSAR products developed in MPS Inc 5.  The CSAR effort will continue to modernization via agile development with CSAR Rel 2.0 or with Milestone Decision Authority Approval, extension of the CSAR 1.1 program for the new requirements. 

5) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) Phase Two began in FY17. This effort modernizes the MAFPS products developed in Increment 5.  This effort completes the development of a centralized/net-centric global mobility flight planning capability, which will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route, airspeed, and altitude optimization utilizing aircraft performance, air traffic management, weather, and other data.

6) Beginning in FY20 the MPS Framework will be established as an independent Program of Record (anticipated as an ACAT III).  The Framework represents the basic fundamental layer of the JMPS software.  It rides on SDC compliant Windows OS.  The basic services that all programs use (Falconview, Data Load, Route construction, flight planning etc)are included in the Framework architecture.  The Navy utilizes the same basic core Framework software.  The funding for the Framework has historically been accomplished through a "tax" to the platform mission planning budgets. The programs were based upon the platform OFPs and the fielded software packages (mission planning environments).  The program office will segregate Framework for future oversight.  Framework will be an agile development effort based on services developed in a  common development environment.  

Test, Training, and Certification:  Continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for all CAF and MAF platforms.

Program Support:  Continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely development, testing, and delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter.

The platform efforts include work associated with updates to the Framework and associated services. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system capability.The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MPS Modernization consists of multiple capability upgrades across multiple platforms that are developed and fielded using a variety of contracting instruments. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB AFLCMC/HB) competitively awarded multiple(Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantities) (ID/IQ) contracts for software development. Currently there are five (5) contractors, one of which is Small Business set aside, who are qualified sources. Each Delivery Order (DO) is competed among the five contractors. Efforts to accomplish program activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support are competitively awarded using a variety of contract types (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP), and Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)). Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts are awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations. Mitre, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center(FFRDC) contractor provides technical support on a no fee for service contract.
Other efforts are accomplished via Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR). For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) provides the program management, contracts, legal, and financial management support. The Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO/HB) is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for all MPS Modernization projects (with the exception of those efforts that make up MPS Inc 5 for which the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is the MDA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MPS Inc 5 consists of multiple capability upgrades across multiple platforms that are developed and fielded using a variety of contracting instruments.  It leverages strategies and efforts originally established under MPS Increment IV and MPS Modernization.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) competitively awarded multiple ID/IQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantities) contracts for software development.  Currently there are 5 qualified contractors, one of which is Small Business set aside, and each Delivery Order (DO) is competed among the 5 contractors.

Efforts to accomplish program activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support were competitively awarded using a variety of contract types (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP), Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)).

Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts were awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations.

MITRE, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor provides technical support on a no fee for service contract.

Other efforts are accomplished via Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR).

For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) provides program management, contracting, legal, and financial management support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Military Deceptions mission is to execute actions to deliberately mislead adversary military, paramilitary, or violent extremist organization decision makers, thereby causing the adversary to take specific actions (or inactions) that will contribute to the accomplishment of the friendly mission.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0208064F, project 676002, Cyber Command and Control Mission System (C3MS) Modernization, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cyber Command and Control Mission System (C3MS) Mission Description: Provides the AFCYBER Commander with the tools necessary to effectively and efficiently plan, monitor, and execute missions in the cyber domain. This includes development and dissemination of Cyberspace Tasking Orders to ensure commander's intent is supported through the application of cyber forces using the latest intelligence. C3MS provides a common operational picture to maintain cyberspace threat activities and integrates cyberspace indications and warnings, analysis, and other actionable intelligence products into overall situational awareness, planning, and execution.

Budget Item Description: C3MS will start modernization efforts based on a backlog of validated requirements to automate battle management capabilities and provide comprehensive cyber situational awareness.  Developmental activities include: machine-to-machine interfaces to dynamically interoperate with Air Operations Center (AOC) systems in order to quickly facilitate collaboration and mutual situational awareness; capabilities to present weapon system operators with force location, mission, effect, and linked information including a standardized, dynamic, map-based, situational awareness interface to display, manipulate, and manage units, missions, network elements, and effects; and multi-level security capabilities to support full-spectrum operations.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C3MS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations (DCWO) provides advanced offensive cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), AF Major Commands(MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national agency cyber warfighting requirements. DCWO efforts directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, USCYBERCOM operational directives, MAJCOM directive and guidance documentation, and other formal requirements documents in the delivery of offensive cyber effects.

Activities within the DCWO deliver operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities through the research, development, testing, evaluation, accelerated prototyping, demonstration, and fielding of advanced offensive cyber technologies and capabilities. The ongoing development of peculiar support equipment, facilities, operations, fielding, maintenance, and logistical support of fielded systems permits the rapid adaptation of current cyber capabilities to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate adversary actions. This portfolio of capabilities permits Combatant Commanders the ability to operate in and through cyberspace to manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy targeted computers, information systems, or networks, and actively gather information from computers, information systems, and networks.

DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing three modular and interoperable elements necessary for the successful presentation of offensive cyber capabilities: Platforms, Access/Infrastructure, and Payloads. When unified these three elements combine to form a cyber mission thread capable of delivering cyber effects to Combatant Commanders to include cyber operational preparation of the environment, offensive counter-cyber, cyber-attack, electronic warfare operations, mission planning, intelligence, cybersecurity products and services and Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2SA) tools needed to attack enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), command and control systems, and create cyber effects through the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).

Efforts within DCWO may include the expedited development of innovative solutions for existing and emerging technologies required for the continued superiority within the cyber domain.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations (DCWO) conducts Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) leading to operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities including the transition of efforts from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, accelerated prototyping, and technology demonstrations. DCWO consists of a portfolio of programs and projects providing the rapid acquisition of operational cyber capabilities. DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing funding among three capability thrust areas required for cyber warfare operations: Air Force Platforms, Access and Payloads. The DCWO portfolio provides capabilities in these three areas that when tied together provide cyber effects to Combatant Commanders.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Mission Platform (CMP) program is an ACAT III program of record that provides a modular, configurable framework for Cyber Operations. The CMP framework is currently being applied to offensive cyber operations and may also be applied to defensive cyber operations in the future as prioritized by CMP stakeholders. CMP uses an Agile acquisition strategy that allows the USAF to dynamically prioritize the delivery of operational capabilities. CMP develops capability enhancements on a regular cadence and delivers them to operations based on operational need and acceptance timelines. The platform major thrust also includes platform integration development activities necessary to integrate CMP into DCWO mission threads.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations (DCWO) conducts Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) leading to operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities including the transition of efforts from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, accelerated prototyping, and technology demonstrations. DCWO consists of a portfolio of programs and projects providing the rapid acquisition of operational cyber capabilities. DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing funding among three capability thrust areas required for cyber warfare operations: Air Force Platforms, Access and Payloads. The DCWO portfolio provides capabilities in these three areas that when tied together provide cyber effects to Combatant Commanders. Cyber payload capabilities are required to have deliver cyber effects through the DCWO platform and access.

The payloads capability develops and fields cyber tools and payloads leveraging industry and other Government/non-Government mission partnered applications and programs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations. These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), which requires a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DCWO conducts Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) leading to operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities including the transition of efforts from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, accelerated prototyping, and technology demonstrations. DCWO consists of a portfolio of programs and projects providing the rapid acquisition of operational cyber capabilities. DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing funding among three capability thrust areas required for cyber warfare operations: Air Force Platforms, Access and Payloads. The DCWO portfolio provides capabilities in these three areas that when tied together provide cyber effects to Combatant Commanders. Cyber platforms serve as the primary operator interface in the DCWO portfolio and projects encompass hardware and software development.

The platform capability provides user interface and controls by leveraging industry and other Government/non-Government mission partners' applications and programs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Mission Platform (CMP) program is an ACAT III program of record that provides a modular, configurable framework for Cyber Operations. The CMP framework is currently being applied to offensive cyber operations and may also be applied to defensive cyber operations in the future as prioritized by CMP stakeholders. CMP uses an Agile acquisition strategy that allows the USAF to dynamically prioritize the delivery of operational capabilities. CMP develops capability enhancements on a regular cadence and delivers them to operations based on operational need and acceptance timelines. The platform project also includes platform integration development activities necessary to integrate CMP into DCWO mission threads.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations. These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), which requires a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations (DCWO) conducts Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) leading to operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities including the transition of efforts from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, accelerated prototyping, and technology demonstrations. DCWO consists of a portfolio of programs and projects providing the rapid acquisition of operational cyber capabilities. DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing funding among three capability thrust areas required for cyber warfare operations: Air Force Platforms, Access and Payloads. The DCWO portfolio provides capabilities in these three areas that when tied together provide cyber effects to Combatant Commanders. Cyber access capabilities enables a variety of DCWO missions and projects encompass hardware and software development.

The Access capability provides connectivity and required infrastructure by leveraging industry and other Government/non-Government mission partners' applications and programs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations. These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), which requires a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AF Defensive Cyberspace Operations (AF DCO) provides defensive cyber capabilities that protect the AFNET and DoD network enclaves, to include their associated computer systems, software applications and sensitive operational information against unauthorized intrusion, corruption, and/or destruction. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities, computer and network systems security, damage assessment and recovery, cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation, and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.

Firestarter utilizes cyber and Information Assurance (IA) technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various government research laboratories, to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide IA &amp; Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements. The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $3.16 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/ Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system develops new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats. The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access. CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems. Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance. The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams and AF Mission Defense Teams. The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $3.773 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, Email Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations. CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.

AF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system and is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks. ACD supports Air Force and Combatant Commanders by conducting synchronized Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and providing 24/7/365 monitoring and defense of USAF and US Central Command Secure/Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) systems against hostile attack. Daily intrusions to the AF network are analyzed in a forensics manner to identify a multitude of counter defensive and defensive tools and techniques that are required to truly strengthen cyber security. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and other Federal R&amp;D entities often have cutting edge solutions, that, with Research and Development funding, can be taken to the technology readiness level (TRL) needed for rapid deployment as new capability to counter critical cyber weapon system vulnerabilities. AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.

Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This requirement supports the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment / Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system development of new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to enhance command and control situational awareness and to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams and AF Mission Defense Teams.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) monitors and reports telecommunications that include sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets:  telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-Mail Communications, Internet-based Capabilities, and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations. CDA shows its true capability in information protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations through malicious, intentional, and/or inadvertent compromises of information.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>AF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapons system and is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks. ACD supports Air Force and Combatant Commanders by conducting synchronized Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and providing 24/7/365 monitoring and defense of USAF and US Central Command Secure/Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) systems against hostile attack. Daily intrusions to the AF network are analyzed in a forensics manner to identify a multitude of counter defensive and defensive tools and techniques that are required to truly strengthen cyber security. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and other Federal R&amp;D entities often have cutting edge solutions, that, with Research and Development funding, take them to the technology readiness level (TRL) needed for rapid deployment as new capabilities to counter critical cyber weapon system vulnerabilities. AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF Cyber Defensive weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Cyber Command and Control (JCC2) provides Combatant Commanders, Joint Force Commanders and Service Component Commanders with enhanced situational awareness and battle management for cyberspace operations missions and forces. JCC2 establishes congressionally directed focal point to provide integrated JCC2 solutions to all echelons for execution of cyberspace operations to enable and accelerate planning/collaboration between Cyber Mission Forces and Combatant Commands (CCMD).

It will integrate Cyber C2 with Joint, Coalition and inter-agency C2 to enhance multi-domain operations, reduce planning time, improve decision quality and speed resulting in a shorter kill chain. Capabilities will be developed to address the Cyber Mission Forces used to conduct cyber operations.  Additionally, it will establish the Continuous Infrastructure/Continuous Development (CI/CD) Framework (a cyber factory) to pace development with warfighter need. JCC2 development activities include, but are not limited to: rapid prototyping, development of software/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations; risk reduction for emerging technologies; and development and assessment of operational systems for inclusion into JCC2 to meet capability requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JCC2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JCC2 is pre-Material Development Decision (MDD). JCC2 will apply agile acquisition tenets to the programmatic, design/engineering, test and delivery aspects to provide an ability to deliver Situational Awareness/C2 capabilities to the warfighter in a rapid manner. JCC2 is currently researching the option to leverage the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804 or other streamlined approaches to agile acquisition. The JCC2 program office will utilize new and existing contract vehicles and concept, development, risk management, production, or deployment plans as part of a streamlined approach. The JCC2 program office will establish continuous integration/continuous development pipeline to facilitate the rapid development, integration, and fielding of capabilities to remain responsive to evolving warfighter requirements. The JCC2 program will execute the agile development requirements provided by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and USCYBERCOM stakeholder in accordance with the prioritization provided by the multi-Service JCC2 governance structure. The initial JCC2 capability will deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for immediate deployment and operational use. Subsequent build iterations will continue to deliver enhanced capabilities incrementally building the JCC2 capability to match warfighter needs. The JCC2 baseline capability relies on extensive development and evaluation efforts to analyze integration constraints and opportunities of Service-specific cyber capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unified Platform provides the Cyber Mission Forces, U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), AF Major Commands, and Service cyber components a Joint cyber operations infrastructure enabling full spectrum cyberspace operations at the operational through tactical levels of warfare.  The DoD, AF, and the Cyber Mission Force require an interconnected and interoperable cyber infrastructure to conduct integrated planning and execution of cyberspace operations to meet Combatant Commander requirements.  Unified Platform delivers this capability through the integration of disparate firing platforms, existing or evolving systems, infrastructure, mission capabilities, data analytics, and programs used for military cyber operations to build interoperable and scalable network for cyber capabilities.  A common, Unified Platform allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision and operational superiority, the key to successful cyber operations within the highly dynamic cyberspace domain.

Foundational Efforts provide for the research, development, prototype maturation, integration, enhancement, delivery, and enduring product support of the Unified Platform capability to ensure responsiveness to warfighter requirements within operationally relevant timeframes.  With the government as the lead integrator, Unified Platform Foundational Efforts provide a flexible—yet disciplined—agile development/security/operations (DevSecOps) capability to generate new capabilities, integrate existing and emerging technologies, incorporate rapid prototyping efforts, and evolve the Unified Platform baseline on an agile basis.  Foundational efforts include both the management of the DevSecOps capabilities including systems engineering, risk management, contracting, test, and program management as well as the active research and capability development to be conducted for the Unified Platform baseline.  Foundational efforts are informed in part by Unified Platform prototyping efforts (BA 4, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, BPACs 646504 AF Prototyping and 646505 USCYBERCOM Prototyping).

The Secretary of the Air Force leads the Unified Platform effort as Executive Agent on behalf of the Department of Defense.  Unified Platform directly supports the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), USCYBERCOM operational directives, the latest MAJCOM Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Unified Platform weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Unified Platform represents a flexible, interoperable, and scalable warfighter capability to be employed by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in conjunction with U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).  In order to match the speed of need of the highly dynamic cyberspace domain, the Service-agnostic Unified Platform capability implements a scaled agile development framework (SAFe) to facilitate the rapid development, integration, and fielding of capabilities to remain responsive to evolving warfighter requirements.  The Unified Platform program executes the agile development requirements provided by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and USCYBERCOM stakeholders in accordance with the prioritization provided by the multi-Service Unified Platform governance structure.

The initial Unified Platform capability will deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for immediate deployment and operational use by the Cyber Mission Force.  Subsequent build iterations will continue to deliver enhanced capabilities, incrementally building the Unified Platform capability to match warfighter needs and requirements to achieve cyberspace dominance.  Early development of the Unified Platform baseline capability relies on extensive rapid prototyping efforts to analyze integration constraints and opportunities of Service-specific cyber capabilities to realize the Unified Platform MVP and inform the future Unified Platform baseline (BA 4, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 646504 AF Prototyping and 646505 USCYBEROM Prototyping).  In parallel, an enduring foundational Unified Platform thrust area supports the development and maturation of Unified Platform baseline, integrates successful prototyping activities, and implements an agile development/security/operations (DevSecOps) construct to rapidly evolve and enhance the Unified Platform capability to match warfighter requirements (BA 7, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 672281 Foundational Efforts).

The Unified Platform program office utilizes Concept, Development, Risk management, Production, and Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to agile acquisition planning.   All plans contain sufficient information to inform acquisition decisions (i.e., authorities to proceed), within the agile framework, to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process.  Unified Platform will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a new Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to can meet many requirements related to Unified Platform.  These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA); they require a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

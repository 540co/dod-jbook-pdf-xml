            <proc:Description>This program funds replacement of organizational and intermediate level support equipment for all out-of-production missile systems, including ballistic, tactical and other missile weapon systems. Equipment procured is used for missile weapon systems maintenance and testing at organizational/intermediate (base/field) launch control facilities, as well as missile testing facilities. Programs will include analysis of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) risks and procurement activities related to DMSMS.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0101213F.

Ballistic Missile Items Less Than $5 Million:  Support Equipment Less Than $5M procures low cost new, modified or replacement support equipment.

MM Power Panels (PPM):  Minuteman Power Panels replaces obsolete and unsupportable power distribution panels within Launch Control Centers and Launch Facilities.

Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR):  Provides nuclear certified tractor and trailer to emplace, extract and transport the reentry system, Propulsion System Rocket Engine, and guidance systems. Replaces current payload transporter to meet USSTRATCOM security requirements and addresses supportability issues. Required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Perf Assess Data Sys Comm Equip Interface Unit (PADS CEIU II):  Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) is used to collect and analyze Missile Guidance Computer (MGC) data, Launch Facility (LF) faults and anomalies, as well as LF security and Environmental Control System (ECS) data. PADS is a critical MM III legacy data system, developed in the late 1970s and redesigned in 1996—1999, using commercial software. This program addresses PADS reliability, by updating software to meet Air Force software security requirements and to conform to the Air Force standard desktop configuration.

Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE):  RFSE replaces the current reentry system test set. RFSE will increase the Mean Time Between Failure, eliminate unneeded Mk12 functions, and add new Mk21 functions. It will provide capability to meet Department of Energy mandated Limited Life Component warhead swaps and to test electrical continuity during buildup of Minuteman III reentry systems.

Squadron Data Simulator (SDS):  The SDS simulates the command and control message traffic between a MM squadron of Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and the Launch Facilities (LFs). The system is used extensively to support Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) weapon system modification testing, field anomaly investigations, and the Hardened Surveillance Electromagnetic Pulse Program (HSEP). It provides extensive faulting and troubleshooting features and verifies operational status of LCCs and LFs following site modifications or extensive site maintenance.

Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP):  The Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP) replaces the current transporter erector used to emplace, extract and transport MM III boosters to and from launch facilities. TERP will update existing drawings, specifications and technical orders to eliminate parts obsolescence and address the intended usage through 2030.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program, Missile Replacement Eq-Ballistic P-40A Item Performance Assessment Data System Comm Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU II), is a new start.
This program, Missile Replacement Eq-Ballistic P-40A Item Squadron Data Simulator (SDS), is a new start.

FY18 funding provides replacement support equipment items for an aging inventory of equipment which has become increasingly more costly to maintain. These items will increase ballistic missile system reliability and maintainability by providing state-of-the-art maintenance repair and testing capability. The program supports missile weapon systems such as the Minuteman III (LGM-30G), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120), Air Launched Cruise Missile (AGM-86A), and High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (AGM-88A). Requirements are jointly determined by Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) and are based on established allowance standards.

Items requested in FY18 are displayed on the attached P-40A. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements.

Ballistic Missile Items Less Than $5 Million:  Procures low cost support equipment required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

MM Power Panels (PPM):  Procures power panel replacements required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR):  Procures replacement payload transporters required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Perf Assess Data Sys Comm Equip Interface Unit (PADS CEIU II):  PADS Communications Equipment Interface Unit (CEIU) is used to transmit MM III Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Performance Data (IPD) from the Launch Control Center (LCC) to the PADS at the support base via telephone lines. CEIU is unclassified equipment, but interfaces with both classified and non-classified systems. This program will update the current CEIU. No modem will be needed for the updated version.

Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE):  The RFSE replaces unsupportable and unreliable support equipment and is required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).

Squadron Data Simulator (SDS):  SMIC SDS Replacement Program replaces failing SDS assets (a total of 12 systems). It is critical to operational certification of field LCCs and LFs, weapon system testing for modification programs, anomaly investigations, and HSEP.

Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP):  Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP) replaces current transporter erectors exhibiting structural integrity issues and addresses supportability issues. TERP is required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>This program, PADS CEIU II, is a FY18 Procurement New Start.

Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) is used to collect and analyze Missile Guidance Computer (MGC) data, Launch Facility (LF) faults and anomalies, as well as LF security and Environmental Control System (ECS) data. PADS is a critical MM III legacy data system, developed in the late 1970s and redesigned in 1996—1999, using commercial software. This program addresses PADS reliability, by updating software to meet Air Force software security requirements and to conform to the Air Force standard desktop configuration.

PADS Communications Equipment Interface Unit (CEIU) is used to transmit MM III Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Performance Data (IPD) from the Launch Control Center (LCC) to the PADS at the support base via telephone lines. CEIU is unclassified equipment, but interfaces with both classified and non-classified systems. This program will update the current CEIU. No modem will be needed for the updated version.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>The Reentry System Field Support Equipment (RFSE) program is producing test sets to replace the aging and obsolete Reentry System Test Set (RSTS) and the Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) Field Test Set (SFTS).  The RSTS was built in the late 1960s, using early 1960s technology.  The RSTS was designed to have a Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) of approximately 3000 hours but has degraded to about 24 hours at RFSE program initiation.  The replacement effort will consist of procuring Reentry System Test Consoles (RSTC), Forward Section Test Sets (FSTS), and sets of support equipment consisting of a RSTC Alignment Console and two FSTS calibration boxes per set.  This procurement action will be done to fulfill the requirements of AFGSC. 

The test sets will be used to test and functionally check out the MK12A and MK21 Reentry Systems and the MK12A Reentry Vehicle's Forward Sections.  The test sets support the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system ensuring its viability to 2030 and beyond. The RSTC will be able to check-out all possible SERV RS configurations.  The MK12A Forward Section will be checked-out by the FSTS, allowing simultaneous processing efforts to take place, reducing overall processing time in the Weapon Storage Area.  The MK21 Forward Sections will continue to be checked by the current SERV Arming and Fuzing Assembly Test Set (AFATS).</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>This program, Squadron Data Simulator (SDS) is a FY18 Procurement New Start

The SDS simulates the command and control message traffic between a MM squadron of Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and the Launch Facilities (LFs). The system is used extensively to support Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) weapon system modification testing, field anomaly investigations, and the Hardened Surveillance Electromagnetic Pulse Program (HSEP). It provides extensive faulting and troubleshooting features and verifies operational status of LCCs and LFs following site modifications or extensive site maintenance.
SMIC SDS Replacement Program replaces failing SDS assets (a total of 12 systems). It is critical to operational certification of field LCCs and LFs, weapon system testing for modification programs, anomaly investigations, and HSEP.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>The Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP) replaces the current transporter erector used to emplace, extract and transport MM III boosters to and from launch facilities. TERP will update existing drawings, specifications and technical orders to eliminate parts obsolescence and address the intended usage through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The development contract, awarded 22 May 2013, included five pre-priced annual production options. Option 1 will be exercised in FY17 using FY16 and FY17 funding after successful completion of first article qualification. Options 2, 3, and 4 will be awarded in FY18 using FY17 and FY18 funding for a total procurement of 19 units over FY17-18.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) is an ACAT 1 program. This program provides a long range, conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision guided, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft able to attack a variety of fixed or relocatable targets. There are two variants of the JASSM missile: JASSM baseline and JASSM extended range (JASSM-ER). Aircraft integration for the baseline missile is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 40-52), B-1, B-2, and F-15E. Aircraft integration for JASSM-ER is complete on the B-1B. Objective aircraft are the B-52H, F16C/D (Block 40-52), B-2 and F-15E. JASSM and JASSM-ER (lots 1-10) have a 15-year warranty. Lots 11 and out will be under Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). Initial Spares are required to fill the inventory as JASSM transitions from a 15 year warranty to a CLS in FY16. Procurement quantities are estimates only and fall within a range of quantities based on negotiations for each specific lot contract. Total procurement of 4,900 includes JASSM baseline missiles (2,034) and JASSM-ER missiles (2,866). However, funding and quantity information prior to FY16 is identified in P-1 line Item 654515.

The JASSM program consists of two separable increments, JASSM baseline and JASSM extended range (JASSM-ER) - both with separate milestone decision points. Each version is broken out in P-5, P-5A, and P-21 in this document. The quantity, flyaway unit cost and weapon system unit cost lines in P-40 reflect JASSM PE (0207325F) only, which is a combination of both JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER. JASSM baseline has been in Full Rate Production (FRP). JASSM-ER started Full Rate Production in FY15, and JASSM-ER achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in December 2014 on the B-1B. FY17 will be the 15th production lot for the JASSM program. The program also plans to use some funds to evaluate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) material shortages, obsolescence issues, and reliability improvement, including flight testing.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207325F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18: Production will remain at the most efficient rate, procuring 360 JASSM-ER missiles. Continue reliability initiatives including Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP) flight testing of current production missiles.

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) is a near-term solution for the Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW) air-launch capability gap that will provide flexible, long-range, advanced, anti-surface capability against high-threat maritime targets.  The Navy is the lead service for the LRASM program.  

The missile is developed based on JASSM-ER (Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range). Early operational capability for the LRASM is slated for 2018 on the U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancer and 2019 on the U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

The Department will transition the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)/Office of Naval Research (ONR) LRASM demonstration design into a fielded weapon system which will support an increased offensive strike capability with an Early Operational Capability (EOC) in 2018 for Air Force platforms and 2019 on Navy platforms.  FY17 was the first year of LRASM procurement and the program procures missiles over a three year period. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207325F, LRASM 
Additional production funding for this exhibit is also contained in Navy PE 0604786N Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare Weapon Dev</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The funds in FY18 will procure 15 LRASM missiles.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Air Intercept Missile-9X Block II Sidewinder (AIM-9X Blk II) short-range air-to-air missile is a long term evolution of the AIM-9 series of fielded missiles.  The missile program provides a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive Infrared (IR) energy for acquisition and tracking of enemy aircraft and complements the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile.  Air superiority in the short-range air-to-air missile arena is essential and includes first shot, first kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures.  Anti-Tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  The AIM-9X Block II missile is critical to project power and win decisively in accordance with the Fiscal Year 2015 Defense Planning Guidance.  The missile is essential to Pacific Command plans to counter threats employing advanced Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) electronic attack, cruise missiles, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  

AIM-9X is a Post Milestone C, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT-IC) joint service program led by the Department of the Navy. In June 2011, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) established the AIM-9X Block II missile program which was approved for entry at Milestone C for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). The 2366 A/B certification and Acquisition Program Baseline for AIM-9X Block II was signed December 23, 2011, and the Block I program was terminated. In August 2015 the program received approval for Full Rate Production (FRP), and the Acquisition Program Baseline was re-established. The first FRP Contract (FRP-1) was awarded in 2015 and FRP-2 awarded in 2016. The program plans to award FRP-3 in 2017 and FRP-4 in 2018.

In FY17 the program will begin to produce a third variant of the missile labeled the AIM-9X Block II PLUS (Block II+) to meet survivability requirements inherent to the 5th generation aircraft platforms. The Block II+ will be procured only for specific critical mission area and the balance of the AIM-9X inventory will be continue to be produced as regular Block II missiles to meet  munitions requirement. In FY17 the missile will also incorporate the obsolescence redesign of the control actuator system battery into both Block II and Block II+ variants.

The nomenclature used by the Prime Vendor for contracting purposes distinguishes the 3 types of AIM-9X missiles as such: AIM-9X-1 is the designation used for the AIM-9X Block I missile. AIM-9X-2 is the designation use for the AIM-9X Block II missile. AIM-9X-3 is the designation used for the AIM-9X Block II Plus missile.

Beginning in FY20, the missile will incorporate tech refresh of critical obsolete components required to ensure future producibility due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS). Specific planned hardware updates include the inertial measurement unit, the dome and the guidance unit processor. The anticipated nomenclature to be used by the Prime Vendor for contracting purposes for the Lot 20 (FY 2020) hardware upgrades are AIM-9X-4 for AIM-9X Block II missiles, and AIM-9X-5 for AIM-9X Block II Plus missiles.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207161F.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 provides funding to procure the fourth lot of Full Rate Production (FRP) AIM-9X Block II (Blk II) missiles, as well as the second lot of AIM-9X Block II Plus (Blk II+) All Up Round missiles for the Air Force. FY18 also begins the procurement of missiles for the US Army upon successful Milestone C approval of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC2) program in FY18. US Army IFPC2 is currently funded under RDTE,AF PE 0604319A,Project DU3 (R1-72). Unit costs are based on quantities procured by all services including the Navy and Army, as well as Foreign Military Sales.

Total Program quantity by service includes a mix of All Up Round (AUR) missiles and Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) as such:

The US Air Force will procure 5,097 total missiles under Budget Line Item 3479 (P1-4): 1,678 Block I missiles (1,093 AURs and 585 CATMs) and 3,352 Block II missiles, including Block II+ (2,859 AURs and 493 CATMs). In addition, the US Air Force procured 67 Block I missiles in FY 2001 under the AIM-9M Modification program (45 AURs and 22 CATMs).

The US Navy will procure 3,937 total missiles under this Budget Line Item: 1,289 Block I missiles (885 AURs and 404 CATMs) and 2,648 Block II missiles, including Block II+ (1591 AURs and 581 CATMs). In addition, the US
Navy procured 63 Block I missiles in FY 2001 under the AIM-9M Modification program (48 AURs and 15 CATMs).

The US Army will begin to procure AIM-9X Block II missiles under Budget Line Item C6100 (P1-3) for the Integrated Fire Protection Control (IFPC) Increment 2 Program.

USAF will procure 310 end items in FY18.

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>Due to system limitations, the Annual Production Rates do not accurately reflect the programs limitations. The Minimum Sustainment Rate is 300 missiles of any mix required of All Up Rounds (Item 1), Captive Air Training Missiles (Item 2), Missile Container (Item 3) and All Up Round Block II Plus (Item 4). The ECON rate is 600 missiles of any mix required, and the MAX production rate is 1,400 missiles of any mix required. 

The MSR is for the combination of CATM, AUR Block II and AUR Block II+. Each individual item does not have an MSR. The MSR needs to be met by the overall program and not just per service. The MSR is shared by the USAF, USN, Army and FMS. 

Annual Production Rate limitations are based on 4 missiles per 1 container ratio.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>The Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) is the premier all-weather, all-environment radar guided missile developed jointly by the Air Force and Navy. The Air Force is the lead service. AMRAAM is a small, light, fast missile with improved capabilities against very low and high-altitude targets in an electronic attack (EA) environment. Funding also used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

FY18:  Due to parts limitations with Processor Replacement Program (PRP) missile configuration and a delay in the Form, Fit, Function Refresh (F3R) effort, the program office has adjusted FY18 production quantities to ensure a smooth production cut-in of F3R design in FY19.  There is a delta between USAF and USN All Up Round Unit Cost based on the different ratios of each missile type for each service. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207163F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 continues procurement and support of AMRAAM for the Air Force and Navy in Lot 32. USAF funds will procure 205 AIM-120D missiles.  Also, will modify existing and build additional tooling and test equipment to support production of the AIM-120D.  Continue to update the AMRAAM Technical Data Package to ensure a viable, producible design through the expected production life of the AMRAAM program.  Maintain a robust supplier base capable of sustaining AMRAAM production for the life of the program, while continuing to develop second source suppliers for critical items.  Resolve production Diminishing Manufacturing Sources/Material Shortages/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier/parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.  Continue to procure Telemetry (TM) Instrumentation Units for Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP).

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY2017 funding totals include $145.125M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.
FY2018 funding totals include $294.480M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations. 


Hellfire is an air-to-ground missile system that provides precision-kill capability and has become a key weapon in Overseas Contingency Operations. Laser Hellfire uses semi-active laser terminal guidance. The latest variant provides for point target precision strike and is effective against countermeasures. The Hellfire missiles are used by the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper aircraft. The Army is the lead service for the Hellfire Missile program with Air Force missiles being procured through the Army's Redstone Arsenal. Unit cost may vary depending on lead Service, other Services and/or FMS procurement quantities. Prior to FY2008, Hellfire missiles were procured under the Predator PE 0305219F. 


Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0201109F.

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on  negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>FY2016 funding totals include $2.52M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations for SDB I.

FY2017 funding totals include $167.8M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations for SDB I.

1. GBU-53/B: Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II) is a joint interest United States Air Force (USAF) and Department of Navy (DoN) ACAT ID program with the USAF as the lead service. SDB II provides the warfighter the capability to attack mobile targets from stand-off, through adverse weather. SDB II addresses the following warfighter requirements: attack moving and stationary targets, adverse weather operations, multiple kills per pass, multiple ordnance carriage, precision munitions capability, reduced munitions footprint, increased weapons effectiveness, minimized potential for collateral damage, reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures and provides a network enabled weapon capability via Link-16 and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Weapon Data Link (WDL). The threshold aircraft for the USAF is the F-15E, and the threshold aircraft for the DoN are the F-35B and F-35C. Objective aircraft include the F-22, F-16, F-35A, B-2, A-10, MQ-9, B-1, B-52, F/A-18 E/F, and AC-130. SDB II will be compatible with the BRU-61 (Bomb Rack Unit) miniature munitions carriage, the Joint Miniature Munitions (JMM) BRU, the CNU-660/E carriage system, the Common Munitions Built-in-Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The SDB II program will develop and field a single weapon storage container (USAF) and a dual weapon container (DoN).

1a. SDB II is an events-driven program. SDB II completed a 42-month competitive Risk Reduction phase in October 2009 and entered the Milestone B Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase in August 2010. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm EMD contract was awarded on 09 August 2010. The SDB II Program received Milestone C approval to enter Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) on 3 June 2015 and exercised the Lot 1 production contract option on 12 June 2015. An updated Milestone C Acquisition Program Baseline is complete. A total of 36 Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) and Live Fire (LF) test missions have been successfully executed to date. There are no significant software-related issues with the program at this time.  A 28-shot Government Confidence Test program began in FY2016. Required Assets Available (RAA) for the F-15E is to be completed by FY2019. The DoN Initial Operational Capability (IOC) on the F-35B and F-35C will occur once all F-35B and F-35C operational testing is completed. SDB II is a key component of the Air Force Global Strike Task Force CONOPs. Department of the Navy first Lot (Lot 4) will support F/A-18E/F Initial Operational Capability.

1b. The total planned SDB II procurement is 17,000 weapons; 12,000 for the AF and 5,000 for the DoN. SDB II total procurement costs in this document only include the 12,000 AF weapons, weapon containers, trainers, reliability captive/test vehicles, tactical to guided test vehicles conversion for WSEP, and associated production support.

2. Small Diameter Bomb Increment I (SDB I) is an Air Force ACAT II program providing increased kills per sortie on current and future aircraft platforms. SDB I addresses the following specific Warfighter requirements: multiple kills per pass; multiple ordnance carriage; adverse weather, precision munitions capability; capability against fixed and stationary targets; reduced munitions footprint; increased weapons effectiveness; minimized potential for collateral damage; reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures; and standoff or Close Air Support (CAS) operational capability. Threshold aircraft is the F-15E. Objective aircraft include the F-22A, F-16, F-35A, B-1, A-10, B-52, and MQ-9. SDB I completed IOT&amp;E in Jun 2006 and commenced Full Rate Production (FRP) in Dec 2006. Based on an estimated per weapon price of $40K, FY2016 funds will procure a minimum of 1,727 (Base - 1,664; OCO - 63). FY17 OCO funds will procure a minimum of 4,195. SDB I weapons and weapon containers are procured together as a system. Individual containers can be procured separately as requirements dictate.  SDB I procurement supports current combat operations and replenishment of SDB I weapons used in these operations.  

Funds may be used to resolve production DMS/MS/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier/parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.

            <proc:Description>The Air Force Industrial Preparedness program element combines the resources of several appropriations (Aircraft Procurement, Missile Procurement, and Operation and Maintenance) to create a comprehensive program that aids in ensuring the defense industry can supply reliable, affordable systems to operational commanders.
 
The Missile Procurement part of Industrial Preparedness supports the management and upkeep of Air Force Plant 44, Tucson, AZ. This includes capital type rehabilitation (MPC 3000) projects for repair and expansion, major capital rehabilitation, construction, demolition, equipment movement and energy conservation and environmental compliance (MPC 7000) efforts to ensure compliance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements. The environmental compliance program includes efforts to enhance compliance through pollution prevention reducing controlled emissions and use of hazardous materials. Air Force Plant 44 is the backbone of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems assembly and maintenance supporting AMRAAM, Javelin, Griffin, Phalanx, Sidewinder, Standard Missiles, Stinger, Tomahawk, and numerous other weapon systems. Funds are provided within this appropriation to assess space-related industrial base concerns (MPC 6000).

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 funds environmental compliance (MPC 7000) and capital type rehabilitation (MPC 3000) programs, at Air Force Plant 44, a unique defense asset which supports the production of several missile systems for the Air Force and the Navy.  In FY2018 there are also funds for space-related industrial base assessments (MPC 6000).</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Funding for this mod in FY15 ($4.7M) and FY16 ($13.7M) was in PE0101213F, M30MLG, MM III Modifications.

The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will replace the current Mk21/W87 fuze to meet warfighter requirements to support both Minuteman III (MM III) and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The new fuze will be a form, fit, and functionally equivalent replacement for the legacy Mk21/W87 and will provide a 30-year design life. The program will support the current force of 400 deployed and 50 non-deployed ICBMs.

The program will provide needed MM III weapon system modifications, system testing, support equipment, data and training required to accommodate, field, and support the new Mk21 fuze along with the W87 warhead as defined in the AFGSC Requirements Traceability Memo dated 2 December 2013. In addition, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) signed the program's JROC Memorandum validating the operational requirement for the program on 6 December 2016. Currently available Mk21/W87 fuze quantities do not meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) requirements and the legacy fuze is three times beyond its original ten year design life. A replacement Mk21/W87 fuze is urgently required to meet warfighter requirements and to ensure operational capability. ICBM Fuze Modernization will procure 693 Mk21/W87 replacement fuzes. Fuzes will be delivered and placed in supply for installation by organizational/intermediate maintenance on a schedule to be determined by USSTRATCOM and Air Force Global Strike Command.

Life of Program Buy
The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will continue acquiring Life-of-Program Buys (LOPB) materials and components through FY19 to support both the Mk21/W87 and future W78-1 Life Extension Program (LEP). The W78-1 LEP will utilize the same replacement fuze being developed by the ICBM Fuze Modernization program. Executing LOPB for W78-1 LEP ensures this future program can fully leverage the material design, component design, and nuclear certification and qualification activities.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This line item funds modifications to the LGM-30, Minuteman III (MM III) Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system. The MM III is a strategic missile capable of delivering special weapons against a wide range of targets. The purpose of the modifications budgeted in FY18 is to support the operational capability of the Minuteman ICBM through 2030. Programs will include analysis of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) risks and procurement activities related to DMSMS.

The modifications being performed on LGM-30 include: Minuteman Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) modification, LGM-30G ICBM Fuze Modernization, LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit (LCCB), LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3), LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II) and LGM-30G T-9 Launch Facility Trainer Conversion.  LCCBU and RVA II production are new start programs in FY18.

Funding for modifications other than MEECN is contained in PE 0101213F (PE 0604851F prior to FY15); MEECN is contained in PE 0303131F.

Starting in FY17, ICBM Modernization has been transferred to PE010213F, M30FLH, ICBM Modernization to provide transparency.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>LGM-30G MM Crypto Mods / ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) procures and fields upgraded A4 Drawers that implement KS-60 remote key/code change, irreversible transformation and continuous signal lockout capabilities that increases code security and prevents widespread loss of status monitoring.  Cryptography modifications will increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually while reducing associated labor costs.

A4 Drawer replacements will be performed by contractor installation team.

Previously reported quantity required of 506 included initial spares.  457 A4 Drawer modification kits are required to support the Launch Facilities (with 49 low rate initial production units).  49 A4 Drawer initial spares have been broken out separately in the appropriate funding account.

FY18 include support equipment required for operational units and the depot repair facility to perform fault isolation, component replacement, and functional testing.

Milestone/Development Status

ICU II Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development has been ongoing since FY13.  In FY16, ICU II was restructured to address an emerging supply chain requirement.  ICU II testing with the initial integrated circuit solution (Field Programmable Gate Array - FPGA) has been completed and identified several issues requiring additional development.  Follow-on testing for the integrated circuit solution (Application Specific Integrated Circuit - ASIC) will continue through Jul 18.

Key development activities include:
ICU II PDR (Mar 13)
ICU II CDR (Mar 14)
ICU II Milestone C (Aug 18)
ICU II Production and Deployment Phase (4Q2018-4Q2022)

                    <proc:Description>This program, P-3A Mod 5921, MM LCC Block Upgrades, is a new start.
The LCCBU program will address several elements within the LCC that are experiencing supportability issues and impacting voice communications in the MM missile fields. The LCCBU program is a single modification effort that replaces five components. Components will be procured as a single modification kit and installed as a single kit at each LCC. It will consist of five primary replacement efforts: 

1) Journal Memory Loader (JML) - replaces the JML with a modern data storage solution which will increase the available memory required to support annual software changes and mitigate Floppy Disk obsolescence concerns.
2) Floppy Disk Drive (FDD) - replaces the legacy FDDs which are no longer manufactured with a modern, supportable hardware solution.
3) Voice Communications Control Panel (VCCP) - replaces the current deficient equipment to provide the voice communications quality required to perform the ICBM mission and may require additional components to resolve voice communication degradations.
4) Weapon System Control Console (WSCC) Printer - replaces the current printer that is no longer produced and is unsupportable due to aging hardware and a lack of qualified vendors for replacement/repair components.
5) Oxygen Regeneration Unit (ORU) - replaces the current unsupportable system to provide the crew with breathable air during periods when the LCC is locked down.

All LCCBU efforts will support the 45 operational LCCs and additional support equipment/test/maintenance locations.

                    <proc:Description>This program, P-3A Mod 5932, LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II), is a new start.
The LGM-30G RVA II program will provide the following capabilities: situational awareness for both ground and airborne security forces; increasing cybersecurity posture; adding video archival capability; providing additional backup power; and complementing the existing security intrusion detection systems located on each LF - Improved Minuteman Physical Security System (IMPSS) alarm.

The RVA system consists of real-time video surveillance, display, and data transmission elements. During an intrusion, this system works in conjunction with the existing nuclear-certified intrusion detection system to report LF assessment information to monitoring locations.

Milestone/Development Status

EMD will award in FY17 and expected to complete in FY18 at which time production will commence.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>AGM-65L is the Air Force Laser Maverick missile that aids in striking moving targets traveling at high velocities with proven accuracy and low collateral damage. The missile is a modification of inventory baseline Maverick missiles.  The AGM-65L Maverick missiles replaced electro-optical TV seeker components with new Semi-Active Laser (SAL) components. The AGM-65A/B Guidance Control System (GCS) is modified to Laser which is the "L" variant. For the backend,the AGM-65G Center Aft Section (CAS) mates with the GCS and CAS for a tactical AUR laser missile. The modification program is with Raytheon Missile Systems.  Additional baseline Maverick missiles will be modified to Laser Maverick missiles with accrued Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exchange credits up to a total of 117 all-up-round AGM-65L Maverick missiles. Funding also covers the movement of over 200 Maverick GCS units (AGM-65 A/B/G) between the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant &amp; Raytheon Missile Systems(Tucson, AZ).. The older Maverick GCS units are upgraded/modified to Laser Maverick seekers. 	

FY2018 funding totals include $10M requested for Overseas Contingency Operations to fund the modification of 91 legacy AGM-65 Maverick missiles to Laser Maverick missiles.

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>AF Long Range Planning required the service life of the ALCM to be extended through 2030. In order to satisfy the life extension requirement, several phases of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) were implemented. This modification executes SLEP 2, using separate contractual vehicles to replace three critical components with refurbished components: Warhead Arming Device (WAD), Rotary Switch,  Guided Missile Flight Controller (GMFC), and associated hardware.  Up to 24 SLEP 2 kits per year will be delivered to the depot for installation in conjunction with Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) missiles. The remaining SLEP 2 kits will be delivered to the organizational-level maintenance units for installation via Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) in conjunction with scheduled maintenance activities.  Service life extension of this critical weapon is essential to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) and United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) commitments.  Kits are required in FY17-FY23 for this modification. 

Rotary Switch and Guided Missile Flight Controller (GMFC) procurement and installations will be delayed by at least two years due to change in scope from repair to remanufacture effort.  FY18 PB currently reflects the WAD, Rotary Switch and Guided Missile Flight Controller as one kit.  Program will be broken out in FY19 to reflect separate component kits. The FY19 budget will also reflect multiple installation schedules.  WAD installations begin Sep 17, however this represents only one-third of the kit. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

AFGSC updated Air Force Form 1067 dated Jan 7, 2015 to add 14 missiles from attrition reserve to the active fleet.  An additional 14 kits will be procured in FY20 to fulfill the requirement.

                    <proc:Description>This program reflects the procurement of Conventional/Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM)/ALCM Test Instrumentation Kits (CATIK.) CATIKs provide telemetry, tracking, flight termination, and power to support missile flight testing while meeting Range Safety Standards (RCC-319.)  CATIK units consist of payload doors, battery sets, and encryption/decryption units (EU/DU.) The CATIK is a T-2 mod required for flight testing; it provides critical data per AFGSC/CC Plan 001, Nuclear Weapon System Evaluation Program Feb 2010 and USSTRATCOM Instruction 526-1, Aug 2007. Seven CATIKs are consumed each year to support flight tests. This number may fluctuate based on flight test requirements. On Sep 10, 2010, AFGSC AF Form 1067 No. 10-028 increased the CATIK requirement by 66 units.  A follow up memo (No. 10-033) added 14 more units to support flight test requirements through 2028. The remaining requirement to procure is 63 CATIK units. 

Battery sets are to be procured on the same contract as the CATIK.  A set consist of a Flight Termination System (FTS) battery and a separate battery to support the telemetry instrumentation.  Battery sets have a two year lead time from receipt of order, and are limited to a seven year shelf life. CATIK batteries are represented in the "SUPPORT-EQUIP" line.  

The current activity will also procure modified CATIK components and associated equipment to support integration of new KGV/KGR 135A Encryption/Decryption chips. The National Security Agency (NSA) is phasing out the old 68B Encryption/Decryption chips due to crypto modernization. To ensure continued support of the ALCM, the Missile Sustainment Division has acquired a waiver from NSA which supports the continued use of current KGV/KGR 68B chips out to a future classified date. This modification was initiated with an Aug 2014 award to Boeing for EU/DU replacement. Procurement in FY17 is concurrent with the follow-on purchase of CATIK units. The 30 units called out specifically are noted for the retrofit of shelved CATIKs. Remaining purchase will be transparent due to their procurement running concurrent to each CATIK unit. 5 DUs will be purchased to use in conjunction with the new EUs. 

CATIK funds will continue to support AFGSC and USSTRATCOM requirements to keep the ALCM viable through 2030.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

FY18 $7.867M increase for procurement of CATIKs.
FY19 $2.355M shifted to fund SLEP 2 requirements.

Milestone/Development Status

CATIK Enterprise effort consists of 63 CATIK units, Encryption units, Battery Sets, and 5 Decryption units to support flight tests through FY28.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>GBU-39/B: Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I) is a weapon system that provides fighter and bomber aircraft with a tactically significant standoff attack or direct attack/close air support capability from outside point defenses, against fixed/stationary targets. The SDB I weapon system consists of a 250-pound class weapon, a 4-place common carriage system, logistics support and mission planning module. The FY2018 modifications are to the bomb rack unit (BRU-61/A) carriages. This modification adds capability to operate on 270 volts direct current (VDC) aircraft power in addition to the current configuration of 115 volts alternating current (VAC) capability. This will reduce risk to F-35A integration of SDB I and provide future aircraft loadout options to the inventory carriages. It will also increase weapon loadout by 200% and provide risk reduction for future SDB II integration. The original procurement of BRU-61/As was 2,000. This effort will procure 245 dual power modification kits. The BRU-61/A carriage requirement document is the Combat Air Forces Operational Requirements Document 304-97-C-A for Miniature Munitions and Carriage System dated April 2005.

Funds may be used to resolve production DMS/MS/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier/parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.

            <proc:Description>Missile Initial Spares (Budget Program 26) and Replenishment Spares (Budget Program 25)

Program Description: MISSILE INITIAL SPARES (Budget Program 26).  Missile Initial Spares are required to fill the initial spare parts pipeline or inventory for all new ballistic and non-ballistic  missile systems, including modifications, support equipment, and other production categories.  Initial spares include peculiar reparable and consumable components, assemblies, and subassemblies that must be available for issue at all levels of supply in time to support and maintain newly fielded end items.  

Initial spares are funded in the two program segments described below.

Working Capital Fund (WCF) Spares.  Since FY94 most spares are purchased using obligation authority in the WCF.  When the spares are delivered, this central procurement account reimburses the WCF.  Types of spares in this program segment are Readiness Spares Packages, New Acquisition Spares, Modification Spares, Support Equipment, Other Production, and Consumables.

Exempt Spares.  This program segment finances spares that are not purchased through the WCF.  The budget authority is a direct cite on the contract.  Types of spares in this program segment are Contractor Logistics Support, Simulators/Trainers, Classified Equipment, and Munitions.

Program Description: MISSILE REPLENISHMENT SPARES (Budget Program 25).  The Missile Replenishment Spares program funds all ballistic and non-ballistic missile replenishment spares.  The replenishment and repair spare parts are needed to support and maintain ballistic and non-ballistic missile systems.  Replenishment spares include such items as rocket motors, cables, telemetry packages, and electronic components.  Procurements will include spares with long production lead items.

* Project BL1 Materials and Manufacturing Research Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project links materials research, manufacturing processes, and design to enable rapid development and certification of lightweight, multifunctional materials technologies for protection, maneuver, and situational awareness. Research conducted enables new manufacturing capabilities through the development of high performance feedstock materials (polymers, metals, and ceramics), physics-based process models, and in situ process monitoring that can be integrated with process models to enable real-time control and manipulation of materials structure and properties. The goal of this work is to develop robust predictive model and simulation tools linking manufacturing processes with materials structure, properties, and performance to accelerate the rate of innovative material adaptations (protection, power, sensing, and signature management) necessary to rapidly respond to emerging and unknown threats in a battlefield environment.

This Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, and Soldier portfolios.

Work in this Project makes extensive use of high performance computing and experimental validation and builds on research transitioned from PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences) / Project H42 (Materials and Mechanics), and Project H43 (Research In Ballistics). The work complements and is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Survivability and Lethality Technologies), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology), and PE 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Military Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Research Program conducts research on HIV, which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Work in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for clinical trials with global vaccine candidates. Additional activities include refining candidate vaccines for preventing HIV and undertaking preclinical studies (studies required before testing in humans) to assess vaccine for potential to protect and/or manage the disease in infected individuals. This project is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement between U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health. 

The Combatting Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria (CARB) research program was established in response to Presidential direction in late 2013 to create a National Strategy to address the critical issue of antimicrobial resistance. This effort's focus is on the development of new/novel antibiotics, especially those targeting the most resistant and worrisome Gram negative bacterial pathogens, using existing expertise at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and leveraging other WRAIR capabilities to evaluate viable candidate targets for advanced discovery. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities to respond rapidly and effectively to biological threats of international concern.

The cited work is also consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas, and supports the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases to include HIV.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs, investigates, evaluates, and characterizes advanced sensor components, signal processing, and information fusion algorithms that will provide the future Soldier decisive new capabilities to locate, identify, and make decisions about and engage battlefield targets in tactical environments.  The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battle space focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness. 

This Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).

                                <r2:Description>This effort develops the technical underpinnings of ultra-wideband (UWB) radar and other active and passive RF sensing modalities for several key Army concealed and low-signature target detection requirements, including landmine and improvised explosive device (IED) detection, sensing through-the-wall, foliage penetration, unmanned aerial system (UAS) detection, other electronic threat detection, and obstacle avoidance for autonomous navigation. This research uses a combination of advanced computational electromagnetic models and algorithms, radar measurements, active and passive RF sensing technologies, and advanced signal processing techniques to define the performance boundaries of state-of-the-art airborne and ground-based UWB radar and other RF sensing modalities for concealed and low-signature target detection and classification.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This effort develops new materials and devices for the protection of Army sensors and eyes behind day-view optical sights from a variety of laser threats including high-power continuous wave and ultrashort (femto-second) pulsed lasers. This research utilizes a combination of technologies based on the nature of the different threats, as well as the fundamental differences in sensors operating over different frequency ranges. Passive organic and inorganic optical limiter materials that block specific frequency bands of light will be investigated and developed for the visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and active man-made material-based solutions will be investigated for uncooled sensors in the long-wave IR (LWIR). Vulnerability of sensors and optical sensor systems will be studied against high-power and ultrashort pulsed laser threats to determine protection requirements.</r2:Description>

This Project leverages basic research conducted under PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences) / Project T63 (Robotics Autonomy, Manipulation and Portability Rsh) and PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers / Project H09 (Robotics CTA) and transitions knowledge and emerging technologies to PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology) for maturation and demonstration.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering focus areas, and the Army Modernization Strategy.  The Ground Portfolio technology investments are improving logistics throughput and surge capability supporting maneuver forces (Leader-Follower technology) and allow experimentation with manned and unmanned teams to develop the advantages that inform/protect the maneuver force.

FY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE conducts fundamental research on Soldier Lethality technologies to develop an integrated Soldier and Squad architecture of equipment and systems that improve Soldier and Small Combat Unit survivability, sustainability, mobility, combat effectiveness, and individual cognitive and physical readiness. To address the challenges of integrating multiple technologies and sub-systems, research conducted in this PE, significant Science and Technology applied research investments in all areas of Soldier Lethality, focus on how to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes and apply systems-level practices to mitigate constraints from size and weight of the equipment. Research areas encompass individual and crew-served weapon designs and technologies as well as applied research in lightweight and transparent armor materials to mitigate effects from blast and ballistic threats, counter explosive hazard detection, counter-sensor capabilities, and signature management of weapons, equipment, personnel and high value targets. This PE investigates, develops and designs materials, technologies, methodologies and system models required to experiment and optimize Soldier lethality and survivability through investments in mobility, human-agent teaming, and improved situational awareness interfaces and display technologies as well as to provide Soldier-borne power and energy materials and components that support multiple Soldier-borne systems. This PE also investigates Warfighter training technologies and develops the underpinning technologies to establish architecture standards and interfaces necessary for creating realistic synthetic environments to create a single, interconnected synthetic training system to enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon / multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. Human Factors Engineering projects conduct applied research to design weapon systems standards, guidelines, handbooks, and Soldier training curriculum and tools. 

Results of these efforts are transitioned within the Army Futures Command, the Program Executive Offices, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).

Work in this PE complements PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology).

All FY21 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project advances the understanding of human augmentation and interaction for enhanced operational performance with a focus on adaptation, training, human variability, metrics/methodologies for assessment, and task quantification. Research encompasses conducting applied research to develop metrics, measures, tools, and techniques to quantify and understand the relationships that enable maximum effectiveness of integrated Soldier-augmentation technologies. The resulting data are the basis for physical augmentation systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, and intelligent agent requirements to improve equipment operation and Soldier-system synergy. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, reduced Soldier training requirements, enhanced Soldier lethality/survivability, user acceptance, and allow Soldiers to achieve maximum performance. Major efforts explore novel techniques for Soldier assessment, characterization of individual variability effects on performance, development of evidence based design guidance for the application of augmentation technologies, exploration of the relationship of exoskeleton and physical assist device adaptation and baseline Soldier parameters such as gait, neuromuscular motor control and proprioception. This Project will also explore novel training paradigms for reduced Soldier-augmentation technology adaptation times to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit wearable sensor technologies, translate surrogate task performance to operational outcomes, develop approaches to distinguish tasks and individual state and intent of movement, establish database of human movement variability to inform intelligent system design, and identify high impact applications of augmentation.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research to create analytical and empirical capabilities to characterize, model, and forecast human behavior related to cyber electromagnetic events through experimentation and field data collection. The result is increased mission effectiveness that enables strong mission command, intelligence operations, and cyber defenses, which lead to high information sharing, situational awareness, and collaboration. Major efforts focus on applied research to understand the conduct of effective cyber electromagnetic operations in that knowledge is required to create and effectively deploy cyber work systems that optimize human-machine interactions and account for operator and adversary behavior to achieve maximum effects. This Project also investigates technologies to quantify, predict, and enhance Squad-level shared Soldiers' situational awareness (SA) and understanding (SU) across volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambitious operating environments leading to demonstrated increases in mission effectiveness. The result of this effort will be systems that use real-time opportunistic measures of Soldier SA to adapt autonomous assets (routes, surveillance targets, etc.) based on dynamic needs of the Soldier/Squad due to changing mission environment. In addition, this Project will develop novel technologies and approaches to represent uncertain and dynamically changing information in a manner that is effective and quickly understood with reduced Soldier/Squad burden and minimal training requirements.

Results of these efforts are provided to Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Program Managers, Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                <r2:Description>This research provides human cyber operations assessment and advanced human decision-support capabilities to deploy cyber work systems that optimize human-machine interactions and account for operator and adversary behavior. Without these capabilities, future cyber work systems will be too complex and burdensome for operator use and training resulting in critical bottlenecks as operators have to ?catch-up? with the speed of cyber activity. This research also supports technologies for Squad-level SA assessment (information visualization) that provide command-level decision support with communication and intervention capabilities. Research focuses on algorithms for the quantification and visualization of collective uncertainty at the squad level for mission command decision making. This effort also supports the monitoring and assessing of Soldier tactical readiness and effectiveness through technologies and approaches for opportunistic human sensing.</r2:Description>

Investigates material node platforms and other component concepts supporting rapid emplacement and displacement with enhanced survivability, mobility, signature management protection, and secured/non- degraded communication capabilities. Investigates and conducts experiments to validate component performance in a multi- domain battle operations. The large-footprint and logistics-intensive nature of current mission command systems compromise Soldier Lethality and mission effectiveness and do not provide the enhanced mobility and protection necessary to effectively execute mission command operations in the extremely expeditionary, multi-domain environment of the future. This research effort will enable tactical leaders to make timely decisions, integrate more seamlessly into the battlefield through a decrease in size, signature, and logistics burden, and will increase both maneuverability and survivability by enabling the development of agile Command Posts that support Multi-Domain Operations.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the research and investigation of component technologies to enhance cargo and personnel airdrop capabilities for global precision delivery, rapid deployment, and insertion for force projection into hostile regions. Areas of emphasis include parachute technologies, parachutist injury reduction, precision offset aerial delivery, soft landing technologies, and airdrop simulation. Technologies support the Soldier Lethality Army Modernization Priority. New operational concepts call for increased precision of personnel and cargo in austere environments in which small units are dispersed and logistical supply is limited. The Army requires enhanced payload extraction and other increased capabilities to support the airdrop requirement for current and future vehicles exceeding aircraft payload weight capacity. TheU.S.  Army Airborne Board (Chaired by the XVIII Airborne Corps Commanding General) identified increased payload capabilities as a critical requirement to support the mission readiness profile for the Global Response Force (GRF), and will support Joint Forcible Entry requirements while maximizing the capacity of a C-17 aircraft.

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and complements the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences), PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) / Project BD6 (Soldier Sys Interfaces/ Integration- Sensor Tech), and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) / Project BE5 (Personnel &amp; Airdrop Safety Advanced Technology).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This research investigates and develops standoff robotic capabilities for Combat Engineers to reduce Soldier/Engineer risks and fatalities while conducting activities essential to shaping the environment. It will close the gaps between commercial construction equipment and the requirements of the future Engineer Force to support maneuver, movement, and sustainment. This research will develop the capability to generate a near real-time site model with appropriate engineering details to allow unmanned shaping of the environment through physical interaction (e.g. push, pull, lift, or dig). This effort will also develop the requisite mission planner and task execution controller that accepts input from the user and provides suggestions and feedback based on updates to the site model, reporting from hardware agents, and resource allocation logic. The end state goal is the development of beyond visual line of sight teleoperation and semiautonomous capabilities allowing Engineer robotic support to match pace in near term and future combat environments. This effort will support the development, testing, and evaluation of prototypical robotic Combat Engineer equipment. This Project develops modeling and simulation tools that represent realistic states for Engineer robotic operations and develops and assesses semi-autonomous and autonomous construction equipment technologies needed for remote control Engineer operations.

PE 0602716A Human Factors Engineering Technology / H70 Human Fact Eng Sys Dev
PE 0602308A Advanced Concepts and Simulation / C90 (Advanced Distributed Simulation</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs capabilities for reduced vehicle crew sizes to successfully operate a larger number of closed-hatch manned and remote unmanned vehicles in a complex multi-domain operations environment. This Project will enable future crews to perform complex missions with increasingly sophisticated technologies, and in increasingly complex, dynamic socio-technical environments. The applied research will provide the fundamental technologies to enable integrated performance-improving Learning - Warfighter Machine Interfaces (WMIs) that are scalable to multiple crew hardware and functional configurations; reconfigurable frameworks and simulation for concept experimentation and exploration; and team-centered dynamic tasking by machine intelligence to effectively utilize full capabilities of crew and technologies. The research will generate soldier-informed data, reports, and analysis to support operational use in future vehicles through soldier experimentation and assessment of technical concepts in simulation and in-field WMIs. The capabilities created by this research will lead to increased overall crew and team performance; improved soldier safety due to fewer soldier per vehicle, closed-hatch operations, and improved standoff from effective control; and vehicles that can effectively perform across multiple domains of battle.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NCVG).

                                <r2:Description>This effort contributes to the Army's ground vehicle survivability by developing technologies which electronically or physically defeat an incoming threat before it contacts the vehicle. These technologies involve sensors and effectors interacting with an incoming threat to disrupt or destroy in while it is in flight or before it is even fired at a vehicle. This effort designs and develops modern armors that directly complement and are optimized to work with active defense technologies in order to implement sophisticated mass efficient mechanisms and leverage investments in materials to act as a system for the defeat of advanced threats and active protection system residuals. This effort designs and develops active blast mitigation technologies to counter the effects of underbody attacks to ground vehicles. This effort will also design and develop the required advanced structures required to accommodate active blast mitigation technologies into vehicles. The design of the structure and active defense technology is critical to an effective blast survivability solution.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This effort develops new materials and devices for the protection of Army sensors and eyes behind day-view optical sights from a variety of laser threats. This research utilizes a combination of technologies based on the nature of the different threats, as well as the fundamental differences in sensors operating over different frequency ranges. Passive optical limiting materials that block specific frequency bands of light will be investigated and developed for the visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and active man-made material-based solutions will be investigated for uncooled sensors in the long-wave infrared. Vulnerability of sensors and optical sensor systems will be studied against high-power and ultra-short pulsed laser threats to determine protection requirements.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs and developsArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies to increase autonomy and mobility to perform teamed operations with manned and unmanned air and ground vehicles in a military relevant environment through data collection on relevant platforms. Data collection investigates the usage of both simulation and live data. Simulation will provide a baseline to collect, clean, and analyze data that meets the need for developing algorithms to enable both intelligent formation control and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) map input for unmanned ground vehicle Mobility. This Project will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using ML and other AI methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI/ML techniques to develop intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for Global Positioning System. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to develop algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI/ML techniques to develop intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAS mapped areas. Data collected from the UAS will be converted to maneuverable information for manned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures an integrated Virtual Prototyping capability that investigates Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) technology integration into a range of novel ground vehicle design concepts that will be analyzed and evaluated through virtual experimentation to provide engineering data and operational feedback to inform NGCV analysis and requirements. Designs and analyzes novel NGCV system level ground vehicle concepts by integrating advanced mobility, survivability, lethality, sensing and electrical/electronic technologies to address emerging and future advanced threats.  This Project provides system level ground vehicle design concepts and performance analysis, assesses cost and performance trades, and provides real-time soldier feedback on technology performance for the Army's NGCVs. Technologies to be evaluated include high efficiency advanced powertrains, power generation, active protection systems, active blast, advanced lethality and robotic control and autonomy technologies.  The NGCV virtual experiments provide an efficient means to give warfighters an up-front, virtual hands-on operational evaluation of next generation ground vehicle concepts and emerging technologies. The Virtual Prototyping results provide critical inputs to the Army's NGCV program by providing independent technical and operational performance results, as well as assessing trades for the Army's next generation of ground combat vehicles.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project addresses sustainment operations by unburdening the Soldier and reducing logistics requirements (e.g., fewer batteries) for communications, computing, and sensing. The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and distributed sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by distributed electronics is attributable to radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF and optoelectronic circuits, devices, materials and wireless power (and data) transfer. 

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and develops next generation geospatial analytical tools for 3-dimensional complex environments for low echelon and tactical edge exploitation. Research focuses on improving geospatial and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) aspects of situational awareness at the tactical edge in the complex environment by exploiting new data sources, automating analytical tasks, and testing new collection technologies, including interiors of infrastructure. Research develops capabilities to enhance/update provisioned (baseline) standard, sharable, geospatial foundation (SSGF) data through automated analytics on multi-sourced spatial data resulting in streamlined, enhanced high fidelity terrain analysis products. Reducing data gaps and processing timelines will greatly increase Soldier situational awareness and support faster decision making in complex terrain.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project develops tactical atmospheric sensing, modeling, and decision support technologies. New atmospheric sensing technologies are developed that enable near-real-time, high-resolution measurements of atmospheric parameters via light-weight systems that can be employed in tactical domains. Efforts include high-resolution local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions that can accommodate the effects of dense urban and complex, mountainous terrain. Both physics-based and rule-based decision support systems are developed for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution; battlefield visualization; reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web-enabled tactical decision aids, long-range precision fires; and modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games

This work provides technologies for evaluation by and/or transitions to the Department of Defense weather and operations community including: Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammunition-PM Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for meteorological message input to field artillery targeting systems; Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A); the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) to improve their operational weather support to the Army.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project develops technologies that will enable precise and assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments. This Project develops technologies addressing the PNT's toughest Scenario - Scenario 4 (no available GPS signal during the mission duration) with a goal of enabling Soldier missions of up to seven days in a GPS denied environment. This is achieved with research addressing advanced quantum timing circuits, advanced inertial measurement unit (IMU) components, multi-sensor modalities, perception techniques, geo-location data, vision aided navigation sensors, and available RF signals.

This research also addresses the PNT Scenarios 1 (GPS operations that start good and have degraded GPS signals throughout the mission duration) through Scenario 3 (GPS operations have 'bad' or limited availability of GPS signals throughout the entire mission). This is achieved with research addressing the ability to transmit jam-resistant, precision timing synchronized signals using optical fibers, free-space using lasers, and in the radio frequency (RF) domain using innovative RF antenna concepts to extend the reach of Soldier compatible capabilities in heavily contested GPS environments.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components, both hardware and software, that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)/electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) guided missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. It focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. Project CYB designs, creates, evaluates, and applies emerging cyber techniques and cyber situational awareness technologies to enhance Army capabilities and to mitigate risks and investigates cyber collection and mapping technologies to offer real time cyber situational awareness to enable interpretation of current threats and predict future enemy activities.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs, fabricates, evaluates, and applies key electronic warfare (EW)/information operations technologies to enhance platform survivability (to include ground combat vehicles, aircraft, and the dismounted Soldier) and to intercept, track and locate current and emerging threat munitions, communications and non- communications threat emitters. This Project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fused munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This Project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the research, development, and evaluation of high-power electronic components, materials, and related technologies. These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with, and as appropriate leveraged by, DEW and power/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.

This Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, Soldier and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Portfolios.

The work in this Project is coordinated with the Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Ground Vehicle Systems Center, Armaments Center, Aviation and Missile Center, and Command, Control, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Center and the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT).  

All FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort addresses sustainment operations by unburdening the Soldier and reducing logistics requirements (e.g., fewer batteries) for communications, computing, and sensing. The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and unattended sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to RF communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution. Energy efficiency improvements will be developed and investigated in support of five key sensor and electronic areas: RF component devices, passively powered components, low-power, long-lived sources, wireless power transfer, and advanced battery chemistries.  Additionally, materials and devices used for photonic applications, such as laser diodes and fiber lasers, will be studied and improved with an emphasis on overall size, weight, and power consumption efficiency gains.</r2:Description>

The second objective is to develop an opto-electronic device that can be used as an ultra-precise local oscillator with improved stability for precision timing applications. The third objective is to address the ability to transmit jam-resistant precision timing signals by investigating the transmission of precision, synchronized timing signals over optical fibers and free-space using lasers. The fourth objective is to explore new RF antenna concepts to extend the reach of IMS systems through pseudolites (ground-based substitutes for GPS satellites) and Soldier-borne systems, and to integrate multiple sensor modalities with the IMSs using sensor fusion techniques to reduce drift and increase positional accuracy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This effort addresses the challenges of selectively neutralizing individual explosive hazards at standoff ranges as well as the challenges of scaling up such capabilities to neutralize multiple explosive hazards for effective complex obstacle breaches. This effort focuses on validation of techniques to confirm the location of buried threats and on the design and development of technology components to defeat the confirmed target. The result is matured components to facilitate follow-on efforts to develop an integrated explosive hazard neutralization and breaching capability. Examples of candidate technologies for neutralization include high energy devices (lasers and radio frequency) and explosives.</r2:Description>

*Project BK7 Robotics for Engineer Operations Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and develops technologies and techniques to support robotic and autonomous operations capabilities, ensure sustainable, cost efficient, and effective facilities, and to achieve resilient and sustainable installation and expeditionary operations. The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, and homeland security. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the capability of autonomous engineering during combat operations to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk/threat and dynamic environments, enables installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and on-demand expeditionary structures, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in contingency operations, including urban environments.

All FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Research efforts model the dynamics of electromagnetic, acoustic, and seismic propagation in response to changing terrain state and complex terrain features and geometry, and their depiction in geospatial information and mission command systems. Numerical modeling of weather effects on terrain properties supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command-delivered solutions to the Soldier. The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) designs and validates applied behavioral and social science research to enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, and leader development) and human relations (e.g., unit cohesion). This PE develops new personnel measures and methods that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE develops new performance measures and metrics for individuals and units, designs innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints. 

Work in this PE complements PE 0603007A (Manpower, Personnel and Training Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Vision, the Army's Talent Management Strategy, and the Army Modernization Strategy.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  

Work in this PE is performed by the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), Fort Detrick, MD.

All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.
Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

* Project MM8 Infectious Diseases and Applied Rsch Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for vaccine, drug, and diagnostic candidates.

Research conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:

(1)	Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases
(2)	Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3)	Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4)	Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control

For the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and/ or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort also conducts studies to investigate new candidate vaccines for preventing malaria and selects the best candidate(s) for continued refinement. A highly effective vaccine would reduce or eliminate the use of anti-malarial drugs and would minimize the progression and impact of drug resistance to current/future drugs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied (pre-clinical) research for medical countermeasures to prevent naturally occurring infectious diseases that impact operational readiness. The Project builds on basic research to optimize lead countermeasures and determines their safety and efficacy in animal models of infection. Effective preventive countermeasures protect the Warfighter from disease and sustain readiness and operations. Infectious disease threats from parasitic diseases, bacterial diseases, and viral diseases are high priorities for military operations.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:

(1)	Parasitic Diseases
(2)	Bacterial Diseases
(3)	Viral Diseases

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports biological and clinical applied research using the data analysis and integration grid (Sys Bio Cube) as an overarching means of complex data usage to solve critical health problems. The primary capability of systems biology (field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach) is the integration and analysis of complex human and animal study data and development of computational disease models, using global multi-omic methods to identify and discriminate unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions (physiologic, immunologic, endocrine, etc.), supporting transition of research to clinical applications. This capability applies a systematic integrated approach to trace progression of illnesses and diseases and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement. 

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Applied research is being conducted to identify biological networks that are causative of illness in Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and co-morbidities (presence of one or more diseases or disorders), coagulopathy (impaired ability to clot blood) of trauma, traumatic brain injury, pain, suicide, infectious disease, and immune responses. In particular, the studies of PTSD are directed to refine biomarkers for screening, early diagnosis and therapeutic target discovery.</r2:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 20MM ALL TYPES:

(E08909) The 20MM Multi-Purpose Tracer - Self-Destruct (MPT-SD), M940 w/MK7 cartridge is an improved, fuzeless, pyrotechnically initiated 20mm High Explosive cartridge.  The projectile consists of a heavy walled steel body charged with an explosive mix and an incendiary mix.  The M940 is currently being employed as a force protection munition in the M61 cannon of the Land Based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) for Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM).  It is effective against light armor at 1,000 meters and against airborne and light surface targets at 2,000 meters.  The projectile self-destructs at 2,300 meters, minimizing collateral surface damage when engaging airborne targets.  The M940 replaced the M246 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer, Self-Destroying (HEI-T-SD) as the primary air defense cartridge.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 40MM ALL TYPES:

(E11800) CTG 40mm M430A1 is a High-Explosive Dual Purpose cartridge (HEDP), and is fired from a MK19 Grenade Machine Gun at a max range of 2,200 meters.  It is capable of penetrating three inches of steel armor and inflicting personnel casualties in the target area.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.    

(E12601) CTG 40mm M433 is a High Explosive Dual Purpose impact type round designed to penetrate lightly armored targets and perform an anti-personnel mission, and is compatible with the M203, M320, and M79 Grenade Launchers.  Upon impact, the detonator triggers the spitback shaped charge and produces a jet blast that detonates the high explosive bursting charge.  Detonation of the bursting charge forms an armor-piercing jet of molten metal and fragmentation of the projectile body.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  

(E74315) CTG 40mm Practice M918/M385A1 Mixed Belt cartridge configuration for the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun is a high velocity training projectile with realistic signature effects providing sufficient flash, smoke and sound upon impact to be seen/heard out to 1,200 meters.  In addition to providing audible/visual signature for day or night firing, the mixed belt for MK19 Grenade Machine Gun will minimize hazards to troops in the training area.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.   

(E05611) CTG 40mm M918E1 High Velocity Day Night Thermal cartridge is a training cartridge for the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun.  This ammunition consists of a projectile assembly and cartridge case assembly.  The projectile ogive is filled with a signature material that provides a signature upon impact that can be seen, day or night with unaided eye, thermal and night vision weapon sights.  The cartridge does not contain any fuzing or explosives, eliminating unexploded ordnance issues on the training ranges due to non-functioning training ammunition.  This item is code B, not approved for service use.

            <proc:Description>(E89600)60MM Mortar, All Types
This line includes 60mm Mortar Ammunition, All Types.

The 60mm Mortar cartridges are designed for use with the M224A1 Lightweight Company Mortar System (LWCMS) in all light infantry battalions including Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger. The short minimum range of the M224 makes the 60mm mortar ammunition well suited for close protective fires against an assaulting enemy, for block-to-block fighting in cities, and combat over close terrain with restricted visibility.  

(E72199) CTG, 60mm Mortar HE ENFRAG, M1061 Series w/MOFM
The M1061, 60mm High Explosive Enhanced Fragmentation (EF) cartridge with multi-option fuze (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,400 meter maximum) is used against personnel and a higher category of materiel target sets providing both fragmentation and blast effect.  This round uses the insensitive main charge explosive PBNX-110.  Lethality is maintained by an enhanced fragmentation warhead.  The M1061 EF uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze.  When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.  
The M1061 is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92900) CTG, 60mm Mortar HE, M768 Series w/PD Fuze
The 60mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The M786 High Explosive cartridge (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,400 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze, tail fin assembly, and high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M720A1, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M768 is lethal and can be used in combat.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92200) CTG, 60mm Mortar FRTR, M769 Series w/Practice Fuze
The M769 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 60mm mortar training. The M769 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,500 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M720/M720A1 HE cartridges. The flash, bang and smoke signature provided by the M775 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E70400) CTG, 60mm Mortar VL ILLUM, M721 w/MTSQ Fuze 
The M721 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges. The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces visible light illumination. This visible light illumination allows for monitoring of enemy activities and adjustment of fire at greater observation distances during night operations. It also provides a means for day/night signaling. It is particularly useful in combined operations with allies who may not have night vision devices (NVDs). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 200 meter minimum to 3,200 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge, allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments.
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E85700) CTG, 60mm Mortar IR ILLUM, M767 Series w/MTSQ Fuze
The M767 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges. The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces infrared (IR) illumination. The advantage of the infrared over conventional illumination is that there is minimal visible light. This reduces the possibility of exposing forward friendly troop positions while also allowing covert adjustment of fire at greater observation distances through use of passive Night Vision Devices (NVD). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 300 meter minimum to 3,175 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge, allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 81mm Mortar Ammunition, All Types.
The 81mm Mortar cartridges are designed for use with the M252 Mortar Weapon System used by the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams as well as light infantry battalions including Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger.  

(E18403)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM HE M821 W/MOFM 
The 81mm High Explosive (HE) Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The 81mm HE Cartridges consist of a fuze, a threaded plastic fuze adapter, a High Fragmentation (HF)-1 steel projectile body loaded with approximately 3lbs. of IMX-104 explosive, a plastic obturating ring, a M24 Fin, the M220 Propelling Charges, and a M299 Ignition Cartridge. The M821A2 HE (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,859 meter maximum) also incorporates the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze. When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.
IM features of this cartridge reduce the vulnerability to unplanned stimuli, e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact.  In order to maintain the required effectiveness while implementing IM features, the M821A3E1 cartridge will incorporate warhead modifications in order to meet all requirements.  Specifically, the warhead will consist of a Fragmentation Sleeve with an HF-1 Steel body.  All other components are the same and will utilize existing production lines and production contracts.
These items are Code A, approved for service use. 

(E18404)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM HE M889 SERIES W/PD FUZE 
The 81mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The 81mm HE Cartridges consist of a fuze, a threaded plastic fuze adapter, a HF-1 steel projectile body loaded with approximately 3lbs. of IMX-104 explosive, a plastic obturating ring, a M24 Fin, the M220 Propelling Charges, and a M299 Ignition Cartridge. The M889A2 HE (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,859 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze.  This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M821A2, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M889A2 is lethal and can be used in combat.
IM features of this cartridge reduce the vulnerability to unplanned stimuli, e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E69600)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM FRPC M879 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZE
The M879 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 81mm mortar training. The M879 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,800 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M889A2/M821A2 HE cartridges. The flash, bang and smoke signature provided by the M751 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E76100)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM VL ILLUM M853 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M853A1 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M772 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall aluminum body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges. The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces visible light illumination. This visible light illumination allows for monitoring of enemy activities and adjustment of fire at greater observation distances during night operations. It also provides a means for day/night signaling. It is particularly useful in combined operations with allies who may not have night vision devices (NVDs). This round illuminates to the full range of the HE round, which allows adjustment of fire at any distance out to the maximum range. The M853A1 (Range 300 meter minimum and 5,050 maximum) is range-matched to the 81mm High Explosive (HE) and smoke cartridges.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E76200)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM RP SMOKE M819 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M819 Cartridge is a fin stabilized thin wall steel body tube containing 28 pelletized red phosphorous (RP) wedges; it uses the highly reliable M772 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze. After a set time delay, the RP wedges are ejected and dispersed on the target to quickly produce an obscuring smoke screen. A full screen can be developed with 3 rounds as opposed to 15 rounds with the M375 series WP cartridge that is used to create smoke screens to cover movement of troops and/or disrupt visibility of enemy forces.
This cartridge was modified to include Gas Absorbent Modules (GAMS) that absorb the phosphine gas emitted by the RP to keep the round stable.  The M819 (Range 300 meter minimum and 4,900 maximum) is range-matched to the 81mm High Explosive (HE) and Illum cartridges.  
This item is code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item includes 120MM Mortars, All Types.
The 120mm Mortar Cartridges are designed for use with the M120, 120mm Towed Mortar System and the M121 Carrier Mortar System as well as use with the Brigade Combat Team Mortar System.

(E25502)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM HE M933 SERIES W/PD FUZE
The M933A1 120mm High Explosive (HE) cartridge with the M783 Point Detonating/ Delay (PD/DLY) Fuze is used against personnel, bunker and light materiel targets. It consists of a Steel Shell Body with Composition B fill, and aluminum M31 Fin Assembly. The propulsion system utilizes the M1020 Ignition Cartridge and four horseshoe-shaped, water- resistant M234 Propelling Charges. The M933A1 HE (Range 200 meter minimum to 7,200 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze.  This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M934A1, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M933A1 is lethal and can be used in combat.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E25507)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM FRPC M931 SERIES W/PRACT FUZE
The M931 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 120mm mortar training. The M931 FRPC (Range 200 meter minimum to 7,200 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training for 120mm Mortar crews at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M933A1/M934A1 HE cartridges.  The M931 is equipped with M781 PD Practice Fuze. The M781 PD Practice Fuze produces a flash, bang, and smoke signature that provides audio/visual feedback to the mortar crew and forward observer.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E91300)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM WP SMOKE M929 SERIES W/MOFM
 The M929 White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke Cartridge is used to provide smoke, with some incendiary effect for various screening missions. The cartridge is filled with 5 lbs of WP. The M929 uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze when functions, detonates the burster, which disperses the felt pads which are soaked with WP over the target.  The smoke obscuration is generated by a spontaneous reaction between the WP and oxygen.  The M929 (Range 200 meter minimum and 7,200 maximum) is range-matched to the 120mm High Explosive (HE) and Illum cartridges
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes CARTRIDGE, TANK, 105MM and 120MM ALL TYPES:

(E22125) M724A2 Cartridge replaces the (E22100) M724A1 Cartridge and provides the Army with a range limited (7,000 meters, maximum) round which can be safely fired at all training sites.  The Cartridge, M724A2, 105mm Target Practice Discarding Sabot with Tracer (TPDS-T) is used for gunnery training in the Army's 105mm Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) Mobile Gun System (MGS).  This discarding sabot round is similar in external appearance and is ballistically similar out to 2,000 meters with the M900, Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot w/Tracer Cartridge.  It is used as a training surrogate for the M900 Cartridge used by the MGS.  The M724A2 Cartridge consists of a deep drawn steel cartridge case, electric primer, propellant and a projectile consisting of a sub-projectile (steel core, windshield, fin and tracer) and aluminum sabot.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E73201) Cartridge, 120mm, Target Practice Multi Purpose-Tracer (TPMP-T) M1002 is a target practice cartridge that simulates the size, weight, ballistics and the loader's function of setting the nose switch of the High Explosive Multi-Purpose cartridge M830A1.  This round is fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  The projectile is inert and composed of an aluminum body, steel nose with dummy plastic switch, aluminum tailcone, aluminum sabot, nylon obturators and tracer.  The tailcone imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  The M1002 replaces the M831A1 cartridge.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency. This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E73400) 120mm M865 Target Practice Cone-Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (TPCSDS-T) is a target practice round that simulates the ballistics of the 120mm M829 Series Armor Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) round. This round is fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  The projectile is inert and is composed of a steel core, aluminum fin, aluminum sabots, nylon obturator and tracer.  The fin imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency. This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E78007) The 120mm M830A1 High Explosive Anti-Tank, Multi-Purpose w/Tracer,(HEAT-MP-T) cartridge is designed for use against light armor, buildings and bunkers, as well as providing self-defense capability against attack helicopters. The lethal mechanism includes a shaped-charged warhead and blast effect.  This round is fired from the M256 120MM smooth-bore cannon mounted on the Abrams tank.  Additionally, the M830A1 is effective against the side and rear aspects of tanks and dismounted anti-tank and automatic weapon teams (targets not suitable to kinetic energy penetrator cartridges). The fixed round utilizes a combustible cartridge case affixed to a steel stub base and loaded with granular propellant.  The fin-stabilized, high chrome alloy steel projectile body contains press-loaded high explosive and a precision copper liner. The fuze is armed during launch and initiated by an impact switch or proximity sensor, depending upon the operational mode selected by the ammo loader.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E88106) 120mm M829A4 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized, Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) cartridge is the follow on to the M829A3 APFSDS-T cartridge.  The M829A4 is the most effective anti-armor kinetic energy cartridge fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  This cartridge has been designed to defeat advances in armor protection, specifically advancement in explosive reactive armor (ERA).  The cartridge incorporates advancements in propulsion, using a temperature insensitive propellant, novel penetrator design, and an advanced composite sabot.  The projectile system consists of a depleted uranium penetrator mated to a drag reducing windshield and flight stabilizing multi-bladed fin, all secured for launch with a composite sabot.  The M829A4 captures several new technologies along with components previously used on previous APFSDS-T cartridges, but incorporates technology advancements to yield significant improvement in performance over previous fielded cartridges.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>(E15101)Artillery Cartridges, 75MM And 105MM, All Types
This budget line includes Cartridge, Artillery, 75mm &amp; 105mm, All Types.

(E15200)CTG, ARTY, 75MM BLANK, M337A1
The 75mm M337A2 is a non-tactical blank cartridge fired from a M116 Howitzer that is used in burial, retreat ceremonies and VIP Salutes.  It consists of a cartridge case containing loosely packed black powder and a press-fitted percussion primer. A fiberglass wad is inserted over the black powder and a polystyrene closing cup is cemented in place with a polyester resin adhesive. When the firing pin of the weapon strikes the primer, a flash is generated which ignites the black powder charge producing flash, smoke, and a loud report to simulate weapon firing.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E21501)CTG, ARTY, 105MM HE, M1 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1 High Explosive (HE) cartridge contains a HE fill and is used primarily for training although some cartridges are expended in combat operations for fragmentation and blast.  The cartridge is loaded with an M67 propellant charge, consisting of seven numbered increment bags sewn together in numerical order. Projectile function is dependent upon the fuze used and may function on impact (instantaneous or delay), above ground at a predetermined height or in proximity to the target area. Fuze function detonates the HE projectile filler resulting in projectile fragmentation and blast.  Range varies from 3.5 to 11.3 kilometers, depending on the number of charge bags used.  The program remanufactures/recapitalizes the remaining unserviceable cartridges through replacement of M67 Prop Charge and Primer at a reduced cost over new production to provide a cost effective training cartridge.  Funding for the 105MM HE, M1 program in FY 2016 through FY 2018 is for recapitalization.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E26904) PROJ, ARTY, 155MM IR ILLUM M1123 
The 155mm M1123 Infrared Illumination Projectile is used with night vision devices to illuminate a designated target area to a maximum range of 22.5 kilometers.  The M1123 utilizes projectile bodies generated from an on-going M483 Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) demilitarization program and leverages the payload contained in the M1066 IR Illuminating Projectile.  The M1123 contains a Canister Loading Assembly, Expulsion Charge, and numerous spacers.  The Canister Loading Assembly consists of an IR Illuminating Candle, Main Parachute, Drogue Parachute, Delay, and Secondary Expulsion Charge.   The outer shell of the canister is fitted with three longitudinal fins.  The projectile uses an M762 series Electronic Time Fuze.  When the fuze functions, the primary expelling charge ignites, forcing the drogue parachute and canister assembly against the base plate, rupturing the base pins and expelling the canister and parachute.  The drogue parachute deploys and the canister fins extend.  The expelling charge also ignites the Delay in the canister nose.  The Delay ignites the secondary expelling charge within the canister after 6.5 - 9 seconds, igniting the candle and expelling the main parachute.  With the main parachute open, the illuminate candle descends at 15 feet per second and burns for 120 seconds minimum.  The M1123 provides Infrared battlefield illumination that is 2.4x larger in diameter than the M1124 Visible Light Illumination projectile.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E26900) PROJ, ARTY, 155MM VL ILLUM M1124 
The 155mm M1124 Visual Light Illumination Projectile is fired from 155mm howitzers and is used to illuminate the battlefield to a maximum range of 22.5 kilometers.  The M1124 utilizes projectile bodies generated from an on-going M483 Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) demilitarization program and leverages the payload contained in the M485A2 VL Illuminating Projectile. The M1124 contains a Canister Loading Assembly, Expulsion Charge, and numerous spacers.  The Canister Loading Assembly consists of a VL Illuminating Candle, Main Parachute, Drogue Parachute, Delay, and Secondary Expulsion Charge. The outer shell of the canister is fitted with three longitudinal fins.  The projectile uses an M762 series Electronic Time Fuze.  When the fuze functions, the primary expelling charge ignites, forcing the drogue parachute and canister assembly against the base plate, rupturing the base pins and expelling the canister and parachute.  The drogue parachute then deploys and the canister fins extend.  The expelling charge also ignites the delay element in the canister nose.  The delay element ignites the secondary expelling charge within the canister after 6.5 - 9 seconds, igniting the candle and expelling the main parachute.  With the main parachute open, the illumination candle descends at 15 feet per second and burns for 75 seconds minimum producing approximately 1,000,000 candlepower.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

            <proc:Description>This budget line item includes the Excalibur family of munitions for the use in the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, the M109A7 Paladin PIM Howitzer and the Swedish Archer Howitzer.

(E80100) Excalibur is a Precision Guided Extended Range 155mm Artillery projectile providing Brigade Combat Teams an organic precision fires capability.  Additionally it provides improved fire support capability due to its increased range of 40.5 kilometers and demonstrated accuracy of less than 3 meters radial miss distances, which enables a first round effect on target reducing the number of rounds required while reducing collateral damage.  Excalibur is compatible with the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, the M109A7 Paladin PIM Howitzer, and the Swedish Archer Howitzer.  Excalibur provides a 35% range increase over current Rocket Assisted Projectiles with a less than 10 meter circular error probable requirement at all ranges.  Excalibur is resistant to Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

(E80100) Excalibur is currently fielded and in use by units throughout Afghanistan and deployed globally to support other Military Contingency Operations. Excalibur is an International Cooperative Development program, teamed with the Kingdom of Sweden (KoS), which contributed resources towards the development in accordance with an established Project Agreement. Excalibur Increment Ia-1 was initially fielded to units in Iraq and Afghanistan in response to an urgent need request in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (as of September 2010 re-named to Operation New Dawn) and Operation Enduring Freedom. Increment Ia-2 was fielded in early FY 2012 and greatly increases range from 25.2 kilometers to 40.5 kilometers. Excalibur Increment Ib provides further performance improvements while significantly lowering unit costs. 

Increment Ib completed a successful Initial Operational Test and Evaluation in February 2014 as well as a Full Rate Production Decision Review in June 2014. The Excalibur Increment Ib projectile was Type Classified and Full Material Released in June 2014.

This is a war reserve item currently being used in combat. The FY 2018 request builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army procurement goals. FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $49.000 million supports the procurement of 480 Increment Ib projectiles.

The FY 2018 OCO includes a total of $23.234 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries, of which $19.045 million is for European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) to procure 220 Increment Ib and $4.189 million is for Operation Inherent Resolve for ISIL to procure 46 Increment Ib projectiles.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes Anti-Personnel Landmine Alternatives (APLA), All Types.

E91700 Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, anti-personnel munition system that was designed to replace the capability of the persistent anti-personnel landmines banned from use after December 2010 per US Landmine policy.  Spider, as a Man-in-the-Loop system, offers numerous capabilities for asymmetric warfare focusing on small unit force protection.  The system is made up of four subsystems:  Man-in-the-Loop (the human operator), Remote Control Station (RCS),the system command and control station, Repeater (a communication link to the munitions that provides extended range), and Munition Control Units (MCU) delivers anti-personnel effects.  The Spider is designed to mitigate the indiscriminate initiation of the lethal mechanism.  A Soldier/Marine makes a conscious decision to engage a target with the lethal mechanism.  Spider's sensor capabilities and controlled munitions provide needed force protection and battlefield shaping.  Spider allows measured and graduated responses including sense only, non lethal, and lethal modes.  Spider also supports net-centric operations by feeding situational awareness information (location and status) into the Battle Command system.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  Type Classification Standard and Full Materiel Release were achieved in July and September 2013 respectively.

E91741 - The MCUs are munitions strategically placed to provide the barrier capability of an obstacle.  The baseline MCU employs up to six (6) replaceable Miniature Grenade Launchers (MGLs) or up to six (6) Munition Adapter Modules (MAMs), and a replaceable Extended Range Tripline Sensor (ERTS) module with six (6) triplines.  This item is Code A, approved for service use. 

E91711 - The Miniature-Grenade Launcher (MGL) consists of a grenade assembly composed of a high explosive fragmenting warhead that provides lethal effects when launched from a Spider MCU.  This item is Code A, approved for service use. 

E91721 - The Extended Range Tripline Sensor (ERTS) module enables the remote deployment of six (6) triplines.  The ERTS provides a silent (from enemy perspective) intrusion detection capability alerting the RCS operator of the enemy presence in the munition field.  When deployed, the triplines travel 10 to 12 meters along an axis (depending on wind speed and direction) corresponding to the six launch azimuths of the grenades providing approximately 20 to 24 meters of ERTS tripline diameter coverage.  The ERTS do not have to be deployed or installed until the tactical scenario calls for their deployment.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

(E36101) Launcher and Cartridge 84MM M136A1 (AT4CS-RS) - The AT4 is the Army's primary shoulder launched, lightweight, anti-armor weapon. The AT4-Confined Space (CS) weapon is a safety enhanced version of the M136 AT4 Weapon. The AT4-CS is a self-contained weapon consisting of a free-flight, fin-stabilized, rocket packed in an expendable, 1-piece launch tube. The recoilless design permits accurate delivery of the 84mm high explosive Anti-Armor warhead out to 250 meters. The AT4-CS incorporates a safety modification to the propulsion system that significantly reduces the weapon's back blast and launch signature. This will allow the user to safely fire the weapon from a protected area or enclosed space during close combat operations. This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E36402) Cap, Percussion, W/HLDR, F/SUBCAL ADPTR553B CARLGUST - The 7.62MM 553B Sub-Caliber Cap with Holder maintains the position of the individual components of the 553B Sub-Caliber Adapter System.

(E36403)  CTG, 7.62MM Tracer, F/SUBCAL ADPTR CARL GUSTAF - The 7.62MM 553B Sub-Caliber Adapter makes it possible to raise the level of proficiency and reduce training costs to a low level both at the firing range and during live firing exercises.
  
(E36404)  CTG, Gun, HEDP 502, 84MM CARL GUSTAF (MAAWS) - For rapid response forces that must have the ability to combat many types of threat, the 84 mm HEDP 502 (High Explosive Dual Purpose) is effective against light-armored vehicles, concrete and brick walls, field fortifications, and bunkers.

(E36405)  CTG, Gun, HE 441D, 84MM CARL GUSTAF (MAAWS) - For combating troops in the open, behind cover, or in slit trenches as well as soft-skinned vehicles and similar types of targets, the 84 mm HE 441D (High Explosive)can be set for impact or air burst detonation. (E36406) CTG, Gun, TGT PRAC-TR 141, 84MM CARL GUSTAF (MAAWS) - The 84 mm TPT 141 (Training Practice Tracer) is the ideal training round for reducing training costs but still retaining the right weapon "feel" and live firing experience.
  
(E36406)  CTG, Gun, TGT PRAC-TR 141, 84MM CARL GUSTAF (MAAWS) - The 84MM TPT 141 (Training Practice Tracer) is the ideal training round for reducing training costs but still retaining the right weapon "feel" and live firing experience.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E36901) ROCKET, PRACTICE, 21MM SUBCALIBER for Shoulder Launched Munitions (SLM) simulates the firing of unguided shoulder fired munitions. It simulates the tactical munitions flight trajectory, but with less noise and backblast. It is currently used by Navy and Marine Corps to simulate the M72 LAW. It has also been adapted to the M141 Bunker Defeat Munition (BDM) and is used in New Equipment Training (NET)/Mobile Training Teams (MTT).

(E88401) The Bunker Defeat Munition (BDM) is a single-shot, disposable, shoulder launched rocket propelled munition used to defeat earth and timber field fortifications (bunkers) out to 250 meters.  The system also defeats lightly armored vehicles and breaches masonry walls using its 83 millimeter high explosive, dual-purpose rocket.  The item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Hydra-70 Product Office is the executive procurement agent for all services, for all variants of 2.75" rockets. This budget line procures all Hydra-70 rocket types in support of operational, training and war reserve requirements.  The system provides combat overmatch capability and ensures the availability of munitions to support combat operations.  This system of aerial rockets is used by Army aircraft (AH-64 Apache, H-60 Blackhawk and Special Operations aircraft).  The unguided systems perform a number of roles including anti-materiel, anti-personnel, air-to-ground suppression and illumination.  The guided system is used to provide increased accuracy over the unguided munitions in precision strikes against lightly armored and soft point targets enabling better conformance to restricted rules of engagement. This Hydra-70 rocket funding also supports the entire Hydra-70 Rocket System to include resolution of obsolescence, safety, insensitive munitions, reliability, weapon integration activities, test sets, engineering changes, production issues and guidance section repair kits.

NOTE:  QTY EA</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Hydra-70 Product Office is the executive procurement agent for all services, for all variants of 2.75 Rockets. This budget activity includes both training standard items and items that may be used in both training and combat.  The Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 procurement supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army's procurement goals.  FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $161.155 million will procure 88,482 unguided Hydra-70 Rockets and 2,000 guidance sections.  FY 2018 OCO funding levels will replace and replenish rockets expended in wartime operations.  FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $75.820 million will procure 60,603 unguided Hydra-70 Rockets and 81 guidance sections.  Procurement funding is required in FY 2018 in order to support the new Hydra-70 guided rockets requirements.  The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to increase procurement of 2.75 rockets.

"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."</proc:Justification>

These flares are part of the advanced infrared (IR) decoy/flares design, which are dispensed from Army aircraft to protect against advanced Man-portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) in current and future operational environments.  The M211 uses a special high surface area metal foil, which rapidly oxidizes when exposed to oxygen.  When one of the flares is dispensed from the host aircraft, the special pyrophoric material payload reacts with air to emit intense IR radiation that is not visible to the naked eye.  The IR radiation diverts heat-seeking missiles away from the aircraft.  When used together with the M212, a spectrally matched flare, and the M206, a Magnesium Teflon Viton flare, the flares provide protection against a wide range MANPADS.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

            <proc:Description>The Ammunition Peculiar Equipment (APE) program provides support for ammunition operations including surveillance, demilitarization (demil), maintenance, renovation, modification, packaging, and preservation per Army Regulation 700-20, Ammunition Peculiar Equipment.  APE is developed, acquired, and supervised through the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition per DoD Instruction 5160.68.  APE provides equipment items specifically designed, fabricated, procured, tested, and adopted for use in worldwide United States (US) military ammunition depot operations on conventional ammunition.  APE maintains a central source of standard, modern, safe, efficient, reliable, and environmentally acceptable equipment for ammunition operations.  This equipment is different from production line plant equipment as it disassembles ammunition items into components, sorts and removes hazardous materials to reduce human interaction and improves personnel safety.  Maintenance APE is also designed to perform cleaning and renovation functions on ammunition subjected to deterioration effects (rust, corrosion, weathering, etc) during its storage life.  APE supporting surveillance is key to stockpile sampling and functional testing of the items to assure readiness for combat or training.  Demilitarization APE is similar to maintenance APE, but must go further in disassembly to destroy hazardous components, sort and reclaim salvageable parts or metals.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $16.425 million will provide APE that must be available to perform ammunition depot operations for conventional ammunition.  APE is required to support the Ammunition Stockpile Reliability Program, Surveillance Program, equipment for worldwide maintenance and demilitarization, prepositioned ships, and Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated plants as Government Furnished Equipment. The APE assets maintain and verify the quality of the ammunition stockpile; thereby saving the cost of purchasing new replacement ammunition. APE proficiently executes the ammunition demilitarization mission to safely perform disassembly, destruction, or removal processes with an emphasis on recycling, re-utilization and preserving demilitarization assets in a manner that supports ammunition sustainment, safety and environmental compliance.

The program provides global support to the US Military Services for ammunition sustainment and demilitarization operations, including deployment, operations and support of the Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) suites. The ASP suites include APE, which will increase the efficiency of the receipt, inspection and issuance of ammunition to the warfighter. Deployment of APE to support ASP suites will increase efficiencies for ammunition sustainment operations by reducing logistics burdens and related risks. This allows for better primary mission readiness, enhanced hazardous operations safety and more efficient operating conditions requiring less ammunition retrograde/demilitarization by providing capability to preserve ammunition assets.

The APE program supports multiple demilitarization processes across the Army’s organic base; one of the most widely utilized capabilities is the APE 1236 incinerator and support equipment. The program performed a downtime and efficiency study of this equipment and began implementing initial equipment upgrades and modifications in accordance with a priority roadmap. These modifications will continue throughout and beyond FY 2018.  FY 2018 dollars will be used to procure, install, integrate and test upgrades at tier 1 and 2 organic facilities. The program will also provide updated specific facility documentations including: technical drawing packages, standard operating procedures, hazard analyses and equipment maintenance responsibilities and procedures.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line provides funding for modernization efforts at Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated Army Ammunition Plants (AAPs) and commercial facilities, including replacement of obsolete or worn production equipment, correction of deficiencies and upgrade of infrastructures.  The Industrial Facilities (IF) budget line also establishes, augments and improves ammunition production capabilities through strategic modernization efforts, expands production capacity, maintains environmental compliance, and improves quality of work environment and safety at ammunition plants, as well as emergency modernization and associated construction to address production disruptions at various sites.

This budget line provides funding for preservation, storage and movement of real property facilities and equipment required for anticipated future requirements at active and inactive Army ammunition installations, also known as Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) activities.  Funding will also support consolidation of laid-away production equipment and redistribution of production equipment that cannot be stored on-site.  Laid-away efforts will also include retaining critical operational and technical knowledge of production equipment, such as engineering designs, process data and control manufacturing practices.  Efforts will also include safety-related decontamination, disposal and demolition of production equipment and facilities, and environmental site assessments.

Procurement funds also support the Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF) to include utilities, buildings, plant equipment, special tooling, and special test equipment being retained to support future production requirements.  Additional efforts include support of associated MIF costs such as grounds maintenance, fire protection, equipment security, and administrative support.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $329.356 million will support modernization projects to include replacement of sewer lines at Holston Army Ammunition Plant (AAP), modernization upgrades to the small caliber production lines at Lake City AAP, and upgrades to the industrial sewer lines at Radford AAP.  Funds will support infrastructure upgrades at Holston, Iowa, Lake City, Radford, and Scranton AAP.  Funds will also support modernization projects to expand the production capacity of RDX at Holston AAP.  Efforts include design of new nitration and wash facility, activation of building G-3 for RDX and nitroguanidine (NQ) recrystallization production processes, and modernization efforts to improve ANSOL treatment requirements.  Funds will also support critical work environmental projects, including improvements for personnel safety and health, and efforts to maintain environmental compliance at the ammunition plants.  Funds will provide for engineering support of industrial facilities, pre-design efforts for future-year modernization projects and procurement efforts at Aberdeen and Yuma Test Centers to include production acceptance tests for various ammunition end items.

FY 2018 funding also supports the protection and preservation of industrial facilities at active and inactive Army ammunition installations and equipment that are no longer required for current production but must be retained for future peacetime or emergency production needs.  Funds support the decontamination and demolition of excess production equipment and facilities buildings at Lake city and Radford AAP and the layaway of various load, assemble and pack production lines at Milan AAP.  Funds will also support the disposal of excess equipment at McAlester AAP.  

FY 2018 funding supports the care and maintenance of laid-away equipment and facilities at active and inactive ammunition installations.</proc:Justification>

These technologies would reduce risks associated with the shipment of foreign object contamination in the bulk explosives shipped to LAP facilities.  The LAP activities involve further processing of the explosive materials, via drying, mixing, pressing, meltcast, curing, and milling operations, into final munitions systems. Metal, glass or other contamination are hazardous due to their ability to sensitize explosives.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

                            <proc:NarrativeExplanation>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.393 million supports the design of a new analytical lab at Holston Army Ammunition Plant (AAP). The new facility would replace the current lab facility at HSAAP as well as provide expanded laboratory capabilities. The new Analytical Lab will be used for acceptance testing of all explosives produced at the facility. The new laboratory will be constructed to allow larger load limits within the lab facilities which will improve the throughput required by the increased production at Holston AAP.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

Currently, only one facility (Building N-3) can produce RDX FEM material, and its capacity is inadequate to support future demand.  Future production requirements for CXM-AF-7 necessitate a significant increase in FEM production.  FEM throughput is one of the main chokepoints in producing this product.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

                            <proc:NarrativeExplanation>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.730 million supports phase three of repair of critical bulk storage tanks and containment dikes in the acid area at Radford Army Ammunition Plant.  Bulk storage tanks vary in age and several existing tanks were installed in the 1940s.  Acid bulk storage capacity is required to handle sulfuric acid, oleum, strong nitric acid, weak nitric acid, and processed (pyro) acid.  The safe and reliable storage of acids is critical for nitrocellulose manufacturing operations.  Containment dikes surrounding these bulk storage tanks have deteriorated and repairs are required to contain an acid release in the event of a catastrophic failure.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

The upgrades will cover production buildings in various areas of the plant that lack lightning protection systems, and have lightning protection systems that do not meet current standards.  This project will bring production buildings into NFPA-780, Department of the Army Pamphlet 385-64, Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards, and UL96, UL96A compliant and certifiable condition.

Given the age of the casting platform, deterioration to the surface areas and joints is allowing water to penetrate into the subway areas below.  This is causing further damage to concrete surfaces and supports and eroding the rebar, creating an unsafe working environment and can eventually lead to structural instability or failure.  This effort will address the problems with the casting platform, reducing or eliminating the amount of water penetrating into the subway area.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.

            <proc:Description>The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization Program provides for the demilitarization (demil) and disposal of Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) managed conventional ammunition and missiles for all Military Services per DoD Directive 5160.65 and DoD Instruction 5160.68 that is unserviceable, obsolete, or unsafe.  The program accomplishes demil using open burning/open detonation (OB/OD) processes or closed disposal technologies (CDT) with primary emphasis on resource recovery and recycling (R3).  This program also provides for operations, technical support and services; packaging, crating, handling, and transportation (PCHT) of ammunition for demil projects at United States Army depots, plants and activities; commercial contracts that provide CDT demil support and services and associated PCHT; and international operations, which include the European and Pacific Theatres.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $197.825 million will support the demilitarization of conventional ammunition as well as missile and missile components (msl/comp) for all Military Services.

FY 2018 funds will support the United States demil operations of conventional ammunition in both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  CONUS demil operations are performed by a combination of Government Owned, Government Operated (GOGO) depots, Government Owned, Contractor Operated (GOCO) depots as well as commercial contractors.  OCONUS demil operations are performed at Demilitarization Facilities (DEFACs) in the Republic of Korea and Japan as well as commercial contractors in the European Union.  

As of the end of FY 2016, the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A) contained 471,767 tons of ammunition in CONUS wholesale storage locations: 440,916 tons of conventional ammunition and 30,851 tons of msl/comp.  In FY 2016, 56,864 tons of conventional ammunition and 11,968 tons of msl/comp were demilitarized.  For FY 2017, 46,063 tons of conventional ammunition and 10,449 msl/comp are planned.  The planned procurement of demilitarization using FY18 funds is 78,441 tons of conventional ammunition and 15,083 tons of msl/comp.

Stockpile growth and generations:  An estimated 38,725 tons of conventional ammunition and an estimated 7,122 tons of msl/comp will enter the B5A in FY 2017, and an estimated 57,419 tons of conventional ammunition and 8,140 Tons of msl/comp will enter the B5A in FY 2018. During FY 2019 through FY 2022, 179,581 tons of conventional ammunition and 40,736 tons of msl/comp are forecasted to be added into the B5A.

Stockpile growth factors: The demil stockpile is expected to grow as a result of Military Services generations as well as other factors such as cluster munitions and land mine policies as well as the disestablishment of War Reserve Stocks Allies (WRSA) accounts at OCONUS locations. Currently, there are approximately 163,318 tons of cluster munitions in the demil stockpile. An additional 117,443 tons remaining in CONUS outside the B5A and another 137,261 OCONUS.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS) program reuses idle capacity at active and inactive Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) Army Ammunition Plants and the GOCO Hawthorne Army Depot through commercialization.  Congress enacted this program in the FY 1993 Defense Authorization Act (Public Law (PL) 102-484) and codified in FY 2000 (10 U.S.C. 4551-4555).  ARMS resources are used for facility strategic reuse plans, marketing plans, building renovation and recapitalization, equipment purchase, relocation, or consolidation, as well as environmental baseline studies and site surveys to encourage commercial use of underutilized Army assets.  The ARMS objectives include sustaining critical manufacturing capabilities and critical skills; reducing facility operating and maintenance costs; decreasing product cost; providing opportunities for small business; and accelerating private sector economic development, employment and investment.  The ARMS program allows the Army to manage portions of the ammunition infrastructure as a commercial business.  This management concept has allowed the Army to apply overhead costs across multiple commercial contracts to reduce operating costs.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.719 million support financial and marketing investments to attract revenue-producing tenants to locate on GOCO Army Ammunition Plants and the GOCO Hawthorne Army Depot.  The ARMS program reduces Army cost of ownership and maintains critical munitions industrial base skills.  Revenues collected will be utilized to reduce overhead and total annual operating costs, improve and maintain existing buildings for current tenants, and perform improvements to other vacant buildings to entice potential tenants.</proc:Justification>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-     Approve component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS). 
-     Approve component OT&amp;E Test Plans (TPs).
-     Oversee Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-     Report results of OT&amp;E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.
-     Review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&amp;E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability
 (IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. 

DOT&amp;E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfare capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for their capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&amp;E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).
-     The approval of component OT&amp;E Test Plans (TPs).
-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-     Reporting results of OT&amp;E that support BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.
-     The review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&amp;E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability
( IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. 

DOT&amp;E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfighting capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for those capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&amp;E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises,  administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort is in direct support of the Director’s Title 10 responsibilities and is a continuing effort.  Funding for FY 2017 provides Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2017 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List. 

Cybersecurity Evaluations 

DOT&amp;E plans to sponsor approximately 10 CCMD and Service cybersecurity assessments and CRCs in FY 2017, each including a “fix” phase as described above.  DOT&amp;E plans to continue working with the CCMDs and Services to develop multi-year plans for exercise cyber assessments and CRC events.  These plans will focus on assessing the CCMD or Service’s ability to complete missions in a contested cyber environment.  To support threat-representative assessments, and to enable continuous improvement of DoD’s cybersecurity posture, DOT&amp;E will continue to work with U.S. Cyber Command to establish a PCO capability for all CCMDs and Services.  Primary objectives for DOT&amp;E’s assessments in FY 2017 include the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats and the assessment of operational missions during realistic cyber attacks.  DOT&amp;E will assess Cyber Protection Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC or exercise events.  DOT&amp;E will continue to develop techniques to efficiently and effectively assess offensive cyber capabilities, and conduct timely evaluations of these capabilities. DOT&amp;E will use the DoD Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) and other lab and cyber range assets to support events, for added threat realism. DOT&amp;E will transmit critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD’s cybersecurity posture.   FY 2017 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME).  

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E.

The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies.  

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E, JASP and JTCG/ME programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME). 

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E.

The Joint Logistics Commanders' Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups (OUWG) input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. 

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E, JASP and JTCG/ME programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The FY 2017 budget will support the Live Fire Test and Evaluation deputate’s assessment of  Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary reports, and the development of Live Fire Test and Evaluation reports for those programs designated for OSD oversight.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives

	The FY 2017 JLF budget will support at least 20 projects (tentatively 12 new starts and 8 projects continuing from previous FYs).  Focus areas for JLF include projects that either: 1) characterize new survivability issues; 2) characterize new lethality issues; 3) improve accuracy and fidelity of weapon data; 4) improve test methods; 5) improve modeling and simulation methods; or 6) develop vulnerability data libraries for emerging non-kinetic threats.

	JLF Air projects will continue to evaluate technologies and techniques to decrease vulnerabilities to all currently tested aircraft, against operationally relevant threats.  Previously initiated projects that will be continued include developing a model for the OG-7V fragmentation grenade, quantifying the penetration of armor piercing incendiary munitions, evaluating the effectiveness of CV-22 Wing Fire Protection Systems, and evaluating the vulnerability of engines to MANPADS.  New efforts will be initiated to (1) determine the root cause of CH-53 and CH-47 self-sealing bladder performance issues; (2) measure flammability traits of AH-64E Fire Detection Expansion Systems; and (3) develop a 12.7 x 108 mm Heat (High) Explosive Incendiary threat model prediction.

	JLF Ground projects will continue to optimize the mix of 30 mm ammunition, determine the fragment spray pattern and velocity for the MK84 warhead, and determine/mitigate collateral damage effects.  Several new efforts will be initiated to develop better test methodologies:  (1) develop instrumented inert warheads to mimic rocket-propelled grenade and anti-tank guided munitions; (2) develop better underbody blast threat and blast box analysis; and (3) develop improved instrumentation to assess local accelerative loading due to blast effects within armored vehicles.  One effort will improve modeling and simulation of buried underbody blast effects.  Finally, one effort will analyze statistical quantification of probability estimates of small caliber munitions in order to minimize the number of Live Fire tests required.

	JLF Sea projects include improving the modeling of simulation of equipment failure due to thermal effects, developing modeling tools for structural damage due to underwater explosions and their resulting bubble loading, and improving vulnerability hydrocodes by generating underwater explosion data that mimics multiple bubble pulsations.

	Live Fire initiatives will also include continued support of the execution and further development of a ground vehicle survivability course.

JASP

In FY 2017 the JASP will continue work on at least 28 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiate 12 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness.  Improve aircraft survivability to fire by increasing the speed and efficiency of fire detection and suppression systems and the accuracy and confidence in prediction of threat initiated fires onboard aircraft.
The JCAT will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness

In FY17, JTCG/ME will continue to develop and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness, including target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and CCMDs’ needs. 

JTCG/ME will deploy and continue to enhance future versions of its two major JTCG/ME Joint Munitions JMEM products, the JWS and J-ACE. The JTCG/ME will continue to coordinate and develop a non-kinetic JMEM capability, leveraging its FY16 Cyber JMEM prototyping efforts. Additionally, JTCG/ME will field and coordinate new capabilities, such as the DIEE and DCiDE Collateral Damage Estimation. Beyond traditional JMEM products, JTCG/ME will continue to support specialized weaponeering data and solutions for Warfighter urgent requirements and support Users. This includes standalone resources such as the Pk Lookup Tools, CDE tables, and munitions weaponeering guides. The objective is to provide efficient and effective support to meet CCMD current and future needs for agility in a dynamic operational environment. 

The JTCG/ME will field JWS v2.3 in FY17. JWS v2.3 will include enhanced data sets and capabilities with focus on connectivity to other targeting and mission planning capabilities for improved estimates and more seamless planning inherent in the concept of operational agility. When fielded, this capability will continue to enable CCMDs to have operational targeting, weaponeering, and collateral damage estimation capability in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training. 

JTCG/ME will continue to facilitate coalition interoperability in FY17. It will supply several JWS version releases to key coalition partners in support of current operations under FMS agreements. FY17 efforts will enable the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Republic of Korea, and other coalition partners to plan operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimates, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses. This capability is critical to the effectiveness and synergy of U.S. targeting and fires personnel working in combined partnered environments.  

JTCG/ME will finalize integration and operational testing of JWS v2.4 in FY17, with expected release in FY18. JWS v2.4 will be the last in the JWS v2.x product line and will include enhanced and updated weapons and target data sets, improved Graphical User Interphases for improved business logic and human system interaction, and improved database designs for speed and updating. JWS v2.4 will also include FIST v2.1 with Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA) v11.1, enhanced imagery, and enhanced Response Surface Mapping/ Penetration Launch Acceptability Region capabilities. JWS v2.4 will continue to address and implement CCMD requirements.

JTCG/ME will develop JWS v3.x product line open architecture construct. This will enable interactive scene base weaponeering, maximize re-use and interoperability of capabilities, increase speed of modeling and simulation, support future hardware/software compatibility, and support allied releasability. JWS v3.x efforts will include formulation and refinement of the Joint Effects Library (JEL), which will provide the modules for the open architecture. JWS v3.x is the next evolution of agile, scalable capability solutions to meet the needs of the Joint Force in a dynamic operational environment.

JTCG/ME will continue to support updates for DCiDE tools in FY17 to support the CJCSI 3160.01B – “No-Strike and the CDE Methodology”. JTCG/ME will update and the accredit CER Reference Tables for selected air-to-surface and surface-to-surface weapons, which are the basic data that supports the CDE methodology. Changes will include additional updates for newly fielded/updated systems, as well as new fragmentation and blast methodologies. JTCG/ME will also enhance and accredit improvements to the CEL Tool in support of advanced CDE mitigation techniques. 

JTCG/ME will field DIEE v2.0 with DPSS. The first fielded version of DIEE, v2.0, will integrate capabilities of an ELT, Precision Point Mensuration tool, and CDE tool, as well as other targeting applications in what we are calling an IDV. DIEE usage in Combatant Commands as their primary tool for full-integrated targeteering capability will continue to grow.

JTCG/ME will develop and integrate DIEE v2.1 in FY17, with expected release in FY18. DIEE v2.1 will include CGS update, CEL interface development, additional imagery formats, and increased Common Operating Picture information on IDV. DIEE enhancements will continue to provide agile capability solutions for the Joint Force Commander in dynamic operational environments.

JTCG/ME will field J-ACE v5.3 in FY17. J-ACE v5.3 will extend and update data sets for missile and aircraft target aero-performance, anti-air missile lethality, and air target vulnerability. The fielding of J-ACE v5.3 will allow greater aero performance options and the ability to estimate counter-measure effectiveness. A key enhancement of J-ACE v5.3 is the continued evolution of the J-ACE architecture to maximize re-use, interoperability of capabilities, support future hardware/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing. 

JTCG/ME will continue to develop and progress to operational testing for J-ACE v5.4. J-ACE v5.4 will provide enhanced data, methodology, and descriptive material to support new weapons in the JAAM and EM. The fielding of J-ACE v5.4 in FY18 will allow for greater outbrief capability and connectivity by units, target detection estimation, counter Air Defense prediction capability, and enhanced architecture allowing future version growth and compatibility. J-ACE will enhance PCDS capability, and further evaluate enhancement of aircraft maneuverability modeling with HIVE/BLUEMAX6. In addition, JAAM will include capability to evaluate two sided SEAD and DEAD; improved target detection capability leveraging NASIC IR and RF models; and multiple ESAMS capability. The J-ACE architecture will continue to be enhanced to maximize re-use, interoperability of capabilities, support future hardware/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing.

JTCG/ME will develop data and methodology for J-ACE v5.5. J-ACE v5.5 will include rotary wing aircraft capability and further expansion of electronic warfare and counter-measure capabilities. 

JTCG/ME will perform requirements analysis and plan for J-ACE v5.6 based on User requirements from working groups and training sessions to ensure alignment with User community. 

Joint Non‑Kinetic Effectiveness JMEMs are intended to be the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze offensive cyber capabilities and directed energy effectiveness.  

In FY17, JTCG/ME will continue to develop non-kinetic weaponeering tools and methodologies. JTCG/ME will continued to develop and mature the JMEM process for cyberspace operations and directed energy. FY17 efforts will build from FY16 that developed the foundational elements for JMEM production, including weapons characteristics, target vulnerability, and effects estimation tools. JTCG/ME will interact with the User community based on initial FY16 Cyber JMEM prototype. This will help with maturation process and further strengthen the foundation for a full J-NKE capability suite, to include other non-kinetic effects. JTCG/ME will continue to refine these initial efforts in FY17, with increased efforts in FY18.

Since JTCG/ME products are User focused and requirements driven, there is considerable effort that goes into working with Users to establish Warfighter requirements for on-going efforts and future JTCG/ME products. 

JTCG/ME will chair OUWGs. OUWGs are a critical venue for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regards to needed software enhancements and capabilities to support AS, SS, AA, and non-kinetic engagements. 

JTCG/ME will also continue User training on its products in FY17. With the fielding of new versions of JWS, DCiDE, DIEE, and J-ACE, there is an expected growth in training support requirements.  

JTCG/ME will provide help desk and training packages via the JPIAS, as well as product newsletters. 

JTCG/ME will also support urgent operational needs with specialized solutions, such as weapons fielded between product releases and need for urgent target vulnerability surrogations to support current operations.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&amp;A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&amp;A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).

Joint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&amp;E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.   

Threat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&amp;E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&amp;E’s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  Threat Systems provides DOT&amp;E assessment officers and other DOT&amp;E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.

The Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) T&amp;E Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&amp;E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&amp;E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), weapon system developers, and the Services.  The Center’s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  The Center develops unique CM/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines effectiveness of precision guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs.  Analysis and recommendations on CM/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&amp;E, DASD (DT&amp;E), and the Services.  The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM/CCM technology and capabilities.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

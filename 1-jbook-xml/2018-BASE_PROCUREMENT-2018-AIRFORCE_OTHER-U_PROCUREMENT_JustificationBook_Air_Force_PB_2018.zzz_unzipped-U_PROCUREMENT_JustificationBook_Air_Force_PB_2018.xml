            <proc:Description>FY17 funding totals include $2.003M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

Passenger Carrying Vehicles includes the procurement of sedans, station wagons, law enforcement sedans, ambulances and buses.  These vehicles are general in nature, but they fulfill unique and distinct needs commensurate with their design.

Sedans are available in compact, mid-size, and large, and are used to support a variety of functions and missions at all levels of the Air Force.  A portion of these sedans is dedicated for use by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and a portion is procured as chase cars used to support U-2 aircraft operations.

Station wagons are mid-sized vehicles which are primarily used to transport personnel and light cargo. They are mostly used in overseas locations and some high security areas located near missile installations. They are also used in the maintenance and flying operation areas to support aircraft sortie generation.  

Law Enforcement Sedans (LE Sedans) come equipped with a heavy-duty component package for law enforcement and security missions.  Security forces personnel use this type of vehicle for emergency response, traffic control, patrol duties, and base security operations.

Ambulances include both bus ambulances and modular ambulances that are used for medical evacuation operations.   The bus ambulance is a 44 passenger bus converted to accommodate massive patient transport for medical emergency situations and humanitarian/disaster relief operations.  The modular models are standard commercial ambulances that are available in 4x2 and 4x4 configurations.  They are used for the movement of patients under field conditions, aircraft crash rescue operations, and routine transportation of patients to and from medical facilities.

Buses include a variety of commercial vehicles that support a broad range of mass transit requirements.  Bus sizes range from the 16 passenger shuttle bus to the 52 passenger bus.  These vehicles support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) training units, Air Force band organizations, protocol offices, and several other missions.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Description>The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a Congressionally chartered non-profit corporation that serves as the Auxiliary of the Air Force.  CAP uses federally provided resources to provide assistance requested by the DoD, federal, state or local government authorities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to perform emergency or non-emergency public purpose missions and activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Pursuant to US Code (Title 10 &amp; 36) the purpose of CAP Corporation is to encourage and aid citizens of the US in contributing their efforts, services, and resources in developing aviation and in maintaining air supremacy; and to encourage and develop, by example, the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.                                                                                               

Vehicle procurements enable the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) to provide rapid deployment of emergency essential ground teams who are capable of providing critical communications and humanitarian support during national emergencies and disasters.                                                                                               

CAP's procurement processes/standards are described in Department of Defense Grant &amp; Agreement Regulations.                                                                                                            

Program element associated with this P-1 Line is: 0901223F</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 funding procures, but is not limited to, 31 vehicles in support of CAP Emergency Services,  Cadet and Aerospace Education programs that encourage and develop the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.

Vehicle type and quantities may change in execution year due to market availability, cost changes, mission requirements, additional funding, and needs of the organization.  CAP generally receives a mark-up in execution year funds from Congress.

CAP provides transportation for ground teams who support 90% of the Air Force's search and rescue (SAR) missions in accordance with the National SAR Plan and disaster relief activities.  Vehicles also provide transportation for over 24,000 CAP cadets to support execution of the Aerospace Education and Cadet Program missions as directed by 36 U.S.C Section 403, 10 U.S.C. Section 9442.

            <proc:Description>FY17 funding totals include $12.264M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations. 

This vehicle group consists of pickup trucks, trailers, semi-trailers, trucks, vans, utility trucks, maintenance and facility vehicles essential to base and flying operations.  Assets are critical to the Air Force mission and are essential to flight line operations (aircraft maintenance), depot maintenance, component routing to depot back shops and airfield maintenance, and Air Base Civil Engineers performing base housing maintenance and repairs.  These items are critical across the spectrum of functional users throughout the Air Force and provide multi-purpose capabilities.  These vehicles also support mission needs for light to heavy cargo transport, as well as transportation for air/flight crew personnel.  Cargo utility vehicles also provide heavy cargo movement for civil engineering and construction projects.  Without the procurement of these replacement vehicles, the Air Force will not have  the ability to support broad spectrum Air Force operations.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Description>Funding provides for a variety of security and tactical vehicles essential to strategic military operations.  This program previously procured the standard diesel powered High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and all configurations used by the Air Force, Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle (GAARV), and cargo trailers.  Funding will be used to procure next generation security and tactical vehicles to include the fielding of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).

The M1101 and M1102 are light tactical trailers (designated by load weight) in a single axle, two wheel trailer designed to be towed by a HMMWV towing vehicle.  The trailers have the same tires, wheels, and track width as the HMMWV.  The only difference between the M1101 and the M1102 trailer is the model information and payload capacity.  The trailers have various applications and provide the forces with a light, nimble, rugged trailer built primarily for hauling cargo.

Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) is the HMMWV replacement for the DOD.  The USAF investment in JLTVs will begin in FY17 and continue through the FYDP. The USAF JLTV program will need multiple STS Work Directives generated and worked through the Joint Program Office (JPO) for USAF specific requirements and kit operability on four JLTV variants and a JLTV trailer.  The four variants include the General Purpose (GP) JLTV, the Utility (UT) JLTV, the Heavy Guns Carrier (HGC) JLTV, and the Close Combat Weapons Carrier (CCWC).  FY17 funding will define the user configurations on each platform prior to Full Rate Production that is expected to begin in FY18.  Purchase of CFE and GFE kits, as well as at least one JLTV in each variant: GP, UTL, HGC and CCWC will be executed in FY17. Technical Data Packages, as well as USAF specific Tech Data and support will also be provisioned and worked during this time to support the incoming inventory once testing is complete.

Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle: The Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle (GAARV) is an air-deployable surface recovery platform capable of maneuvering over adverse terrain in order to search for and recover isolated personnel and/or equipment.  It will provide increased survivability during "outside the wire" personnel recovery operations, more secure transportation capability to the recovery team and injured/isolated personnel from an area of high threat, and necessary training platforms for operators to familiarize themselves with vehicles they utilize in the area of operations.  It also provides operators with increased protection from enemy fire and improvised explosive devices. Funding includes, but is not limited to procurement of end items, training, upgrades, spares, Interim Contractor Support (ICS), repairs, deployment packages and returns.  This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.

                    <proc:Remarks>PMA Justification:

PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA):  PMA supports the operation of the program office in its management and oversight role via travel, procurement of supplies and Advisory and Administrative Services (A&amp;AS).  The A&amp;AS team of contractors will begin the program and sustainment planning to include provisioning/cataloging and technical order management support AF building of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).  Funding will also support TDY requirements associated with JLTV.

Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle (GAARV):
Based on AF Mission changes and/or AF Mission priorities, NSNs and/or quantities may change during year of execution. GAARV unit cost is approximately $300,000.00 per vehicle and does not include training, upgrades, spares, repairs, deployment packages and returns.

FY18 funding will provide for the necessary GAARV support.</proc:Remarks>

The Special Purpose Vehicles group consists of various vehicles for flightline, maintenance, and facility operations used for a variety of purposes.  Examples of these vehicles include the IW 40 tractor, 4 and 8 passenger over-the-snow-carriers, an assortment of wreckers and refuse trucks, potable and non-potable water distribution trucks, refueling vehicles, deicers, staircase trucks, lavatory service trucks, high reach maintenance trucks, glycol recovery vehicles, disabled patient vehicles, and tow tractors. Tow tractors are used to tow aircrafts, munition trailers, and ground support equipment.  The IW 40 tractor is a small farm tractor used primarily to pull a mower and for other light tasks; the snow carriers are tracked vehicles which move personnel in snowy conditions and are used in search and rescue missions; the wreckers are used to move disabled vehicles, haul vehicles or to deploy a heavy duty winch.  The refuse trucks in this group include one which tilts and dumps a payload and one which compacts refuse prior to discharge. Aircraft refueling vehicles refuel and defuel aircrafts. Potable water distribution trucks provide drinking water to personnel; non-potable water distribution trucks are used primarily to wet down and control dust at a construction site.

            <proc:Description>FY17 funding totals include $48.590M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

This P-1 line procures a variety of critical fire fighting and crash rescue vehicles.  Vehicles typically include, but are not limited to, the following:

-- The P-19 Crash Truck is an Air Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicle that is a first response vehicle on the scene of an aircraft fire emergency.  It equips bases with the capability to rapidly extinguish aircraft fires.  This truck is a mandatory flight line operations safety requirement and is essential at bases with a flying mission. The P-19 also provides fire fighting capability for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve installations located at municipal airports.  An installation's P-19 requirement is determined by the type of aircraft frequenting the aerial facility and the resulting gallons per minute of fire fighting agent required.  This vehicle provides aircrew, passenger, weapons, and airframe fire protection at a crash site.

-- The P-21 Aerial Lift Truck is a fire fighting vehicle with a 105 foot aerial ladder.  It provides improved agent delivery over older model vehicles, as well as the capability to provide elevated delivery of agent involving high rise buildings and warehouse facilities.

-- The P-22 4x2 and P-24 4x4 Pumper Trucks are designed primarily to fight structural fires.  The trucks have a 750-gallon water tank and a 50-gallon Aqueous FilmFoam class "A" foam tank and are capable of applying 1250 gallons per minute. P-24 is built on a rugged 4x4 chassis that equips forces with limited off-road/rugged terrain capability.  The P-22 4x2 Pumper Truck has the same fire fighting capability as the P-24, but is used in urban areas.

-- The P-23 Crash Truck is a larger version of the P-19 ARFF truck and has a larger fire suppression capacity.  It is primarily assigned at transport, bomber, depot, and cargo aircraft bases.

-- The P-26 Water Tanker Truck is a 4000-gallon resupply truck used to support the ARFF vehicles, fight wild land fires, and provide mutual assistance to communities. 

-- The P-29 Wild Land Firefighting Truck is a four-person crew cab truck which contains a modular agent and pump and roll delivery system as well as firefighting tools and equipment.  This truck is outfitted with a Compressed Air Foam System (CAFS) and has a 500 gallon water tank.  The truck is intended to combat wild land and brush type fires.

-- The P-30 is a Medium Rescue Vehicle.  It is designed to bring equipment, lighting, a winch, and a generator to the scene of a rescue event.  This vehicle has 450 cubic feet of storage space and affords easy equipment access and improved storage compartments.  This truck is assigned to the larger industrial bases.

-- The P-31 Hazardous Material Vehicle is a dual purpose vehicle that stows and transports hazardous material response equipment for the purpose of mitigating chemical leaks, spills, and releases.  This vehicle also provides an incident command workstation area for the purpose of research, command, control, and communications during containment/cleanup operations. 

-- The P-33 Quint Truck is a fire fighting truck with a 75 foot aerial ladder.  It provides improved agent delivery over older models as well as the capability to provide elevated delivery  of agent involving high rise and warehouse facilities.  

-- The P-34 is a first response Air Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicle which equips forces with initial "knock down" capability.  The P-34 is the first fire truck to employ Ultra High Pressure (UHP) technology which allows the vehicle to discharge a mixture of water and foam at 1350 psi.  This UHP technology makes the vehicle three times more effective than a conventional ARFF truck.  The truck has a 400 gallon water tank and a 50 gallon foam tank along with a bumper turret and 200 feet of hand line all mounted on an F-550 chassis.

-- The Rapid Intervention Vehicle (RIV) is a first response aircraft fire truck; it is the newest addition to the Air Force's fleet of crash response vehicles.  The RIV is the first vehicle in the AF to use new Ultra High Pressure (UHP) fire fighting technology which makes this truck 3 to 3.5 times more efficient at knock-down than conventional ARFF vehicles.  This feature increases the length of time the vehicle can remain on the scene without having to be resupplied.  Perched on an F550 chassis, the RIV is equipped with  a 4-wheel drive train; it provides seating for four, equips fire fighters with limited storage for rescue equipment; has a bumper turret, a 200 ft hand line and a winch.  Because of its size, speed and agility this truck can get to a crash scene quickly and perform fire fighting operations until the larger trucks can arrive at the scene.   

These vehicles are all built to meet the performance standards of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Air Force safety regulations.

            <proc:Description>This program procures snow removal vehicles and commercial sweepers used on all airfield surfaces to remove snow and help prevent foreign object damage (FOD) to aircraft engines and tires.  Snow removal equipment includes front mounted brooms, multi-purpose blowers, and plows.  These vehicles provide critical mission support to airfield operations because fighter aircraft cannot land or take off with ice on the runway.  Multi-purpose vacuum sweepers maintain airfields, roads, and grounds.  Vacuum sweepers provide equally important support at all air bases due to the high cost of FOD and the potential for loss in FOD-related engine accidents.

These assets are critical to the Air Force mission.  They are the primary equipment used for snow, ice, and debris removal from runways and taxiways year round.  The vital functions of these vehicles prevent the closing of airfields due to debris and/or snow and ice buildup. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Assistant Secretary of Defense/Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) directed implementation of the DoD Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CMI) on 23 February 2001. Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Notice 6510/NSA 3-9 direct the modernization of all cryptography in military systems in the US, NATO and Coalition nations. To prevent information compromise, the National Security Agency (NSA) mandate requires Link 16 cryptographic systems be upgraded. The CJCS directed a modernization effort at the recommendation of the NSA to modernize equipment and provide enhanced security for Link 16 tactical networks (Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CM). Likewise, a radio frequency spectrum memorandum of agreement between the DoD and the Department of Transportation mandate the internal frequency remapping of our Link 16 family of terminals to avoid conflict with next generation Federal Aviation Administration radio aids to navigation. These two mandates, among other operational reliability and capability improvements will be satisfied under a Block Upgrade (BU2) effort planned for the Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Low Volume Terminal (LVT). BU2 will procure new Signal Message Processor (SMP) cards that incorporate the most current NSA mandated cryptographic standards. BU2 will also procure a new Tailored Processor/Ground Multiplexer card, update software and firmware in the MIDS LVT to improve operational reliability and provide the radio the ability to remap the lower frequency range of the terminal. The new cards will be installed in all terminals and spare cards will also be purchased.  Crypto mod kit being developed by the Navy as part of MIDS LVT Block Upgrade 2.

PE 0303135F PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) 

PKI provides identity management (IDM) services to support warfighter requirements.  Air Force IDM programs align with DoD IDM efforts and support DoD IDM Roadmap and Strategic Plan.  PKI provides the basic framework and services implemented within DoD to ensure information systems security. It provides the capability to attach digital signatures to electronic documents for identity management, and to encrypt and decrypt electronic documents for secure transmission. PKI-enabled applications afford confidentiality and authentication services to communications and/or network transactions, as well as verification of the data integrity and non-repudiation of those transactions. PKI is one of many security solutions used to protect information and provide attributes enabling authorization access to critical resources in the Air Force Information Networks (AFIN) and is used concurrently with other solutions. Funding supports several different requirement areas to procure infrastructure equipment for the field in support of AFIN, PKI, Evolutionary PKI End User Equipment to include multifactor authentication technologies and authorization services. The current DoD PKI token (DoD Common Access Card (CAC)) is undergoing a gradual evolution towards a higher assurance token.  Additionally, Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) mandates a common identification card across the Federal Government.  Based on the HSPD-12 requirements, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) which adds security requirements to the identification card.  

PE 0303140F INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY PROGRAM: 

This program funds procurement of Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment, ancillary encryption/decryption devices, and related equipment to enable the secure transport of information. ISSP delivers on rising national, DoD, and AF priorities to address cybersecurity threats and increasing warfighter dependence on cyberspace.  United States Air Force (AF) and the Department of Defense (DoD) require the capability to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority, the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power in modern, high-tempo, full spectrum operations. AF COMSEC equipment protects information such as, warfighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commander's orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness. This COMSEC program ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the warfighter, DoD military forces may suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or exceptionally grave damage to national security. The COMSEC program includes equipment upgrades and replacements which incorporate latest and/or best technologies mandated to provide mission critical warfighter secure voice and data communications in tactical, strategic, and network applications for our globally-deployed COMSEC crypto assets supporting both AF and DoD missions. Details of the assets are included in each section's narrative.

PE 0208088F AF DEFENSIVE CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS 
 
1. COMPUTER SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (CSAP) COUNTERMEASURES: FY18 funding procures hardware/software necessary for vulnerability analysis, vulnerability identification, countermeasure development, and testing in an environment simulating real-world operational environment. From combat operations to social media use, network bandwidth requirements continue to explode at unprecedented rates.  This ever-increasing throughput adds unparalleled threats to targeting AF cyber networks.  To thwart adversary strategies, effective and innovative solutions must be implemented.  These solutions provide daily support to multiple efforts including U.S. Cyber Command and other Combatant Commanders; 24th Air Force: 624 Operations Center; 67th Network Warfare Wing: 33rd Network Warfare Squadron (NWS) and 26th Network Operations Squadron (NOS); Air Force Network Integration Center, Defense Information Systems Agency, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and other organizations that are integral to the successful performance of the 318 Cyber Operations Group (COG) mission.  Threat relevant and time critical countermeasures are required to maintain the advantage against agile and capable adversaries.  Without the CSAP system, the security of AF networks may be compromised due to inadequate facilities needed to innovate, to develop and test new intrusion detection signatures and investigate new technologies and architectures being integrated into AF networks.

PE 0303135F PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI): 
 
1.  EVOLUTIONARY PKI END USER EQUIPMENT: FY18 funding supports PKI Identity and Access Management needs that must be procured rapidly to strengthen and defend the Air Force Information Network (AFIN) from new and evolving vulnerabilities.  Funding and quantities directly support PKI-based software authentication and hardware security afforded by smartcards or other hardware methods, enabling users to authenticate securely to the network.  As PKI continues to evolve, there is an increased need for alternative methods of two-factor authentication as well as the introduction of multi-factor authentication methods.  The classic paradigm for authentication systems identifies three factors as the cornerstone of authentication:  1) Something you know (e.g., a password or PIN), 2) Something you have (e.g., an ID badge or a cryptographic key), and 3) Something you are (e.g., a fingerprint or biometric data).  Multi-factor authentication refers to the use of more than one of the factors.  The strength of authentication systems is largely determined by the number of factors incorporated by the system. While the Alternative Tokens (ALT) provide usable two factor authentication for many use cases, the sustainability of continued issuance of such hardware tokens is short-lived for several reasons.  This effort will examine alternate e-authentication technologies that may provide appropriate multi-factor authentication for users, privileged users and system administrators.  

 
2.  AIR FORCE DIRECTORY SERVICES (AFDS): AFDS is one of three pillars of DoD Identity Management. The others are PKI and CAC. AFDS ensures that AF user identities are common and synchronized across directories and information stores of various networks, systems, and applications. AFDS eliminates the disparity of maintaining stove-piped systems and through the use of directory technology, alleviates latency associated with the sharing/replication of identity data attributes. AFDS supports delivery of an enterprise security service and backbone for AF networks (both in-garrison and tactical), by providing AF user credentials to the AF Network Enterprise and AF system applications. AFDS addresses challenges and enhances AF mission performance through seamless integrated access to the right information anywhere, anytime. AFDS leverages and provides a core meta-directory service that "joins" and synchronizes personal identity data attributes from authoritative AF and DoD repositories for use by all AF systems and applications. FY18 funds will procure hardware, software, and support upgrades.

1. Space COMSEC Mission: Space COMSEC procures crypto products for ground nodes that link to space assets. Space COMSEC equipment is a foundational element in achieving Air Force space and information superiority. Space COMSEC is an enabler for space system compliance with DoD I 8581.01 - Information Assurance (lA) Policy for Space Systems used by the Department of Defense. Space COMSEC mission provides communications security products and lifecycle sustainment support to all DoD satellite systems and commercial systems supporting DoD missions. It enables secure Command and Control (C2) of satellites and prevents unauthorized access and destruction. It enables secure transmission of satellite system's health status telemetry data (satellite health and relative orbital position) to ground control stations, thus protecting critical information about the capabilities of DoD satellite systems. The capability of a system must be protected from an adversary to avoid exploitation of a system weakness/limitation, knowledge of which could assist an adversary in a successful mission against DoD military forces and potential loss of life. Space COMSEC also provides secure transmission of information collected by satellite sensors, which provides the warfighter an integrated view of the battle space. Space COMSEC provides for secure SATCOM, positioning, navigation, timing, weather, nuclear detection and early warning missions. Space COMSEC also enables transmission security (TRANSEC) for space platforms. Space COMSEC mission procures crypto end items and logistics elements to support developing and operational space systems. Funding for this effort is in PE 0303140F. 
 
      a. PRODUCTS: FY17 &amp; FY18 funding moved to APPN 3021 Space Procurement.  FY16 funding provided for the production of Space COMSEC products to meet developing and operational space program needs. Space COMSEC products include End Crypto Units (ECU), Embedment Solutions (ES), TRANSEC, and ancillaries. Due to low volume production quantities and high reliability design, Space COMSEC products can range in price from $10K per unit to $2M per unit. As a commodity item, Space COMSEC procures standard crypto products, which enable minimized lifecycle footprints. Space COMSEC procures from multiple crypto vendors, however, with the low volume consumption by space programs the space crypto industry base is less than a dozen companies. 
 
      b. LOGISTICS: FY17 &amp; FY18 funding moved to APPN 3021 Space Procurement.  FY16 funding provided for the production of Space COMSEC logistics elements. Space COMSEC products typically have a 20 to 40 year life cycles to support development, launch, and operation of multiple AF and DoD space systems. Space COMSEC is provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the space system developing contractors and operational ground stations. Space COMSEC products are high-cost critical assets. They are organically sustained to include component level maintenance exclusively by the AF. Logistics procures the necessary lifecycle sustainment elements required to meet the 40 year mission requirements. Logistics elements include specialized test sets, certified training materials and courses, maintenance manuals, provisioning, and modifications. 
 
2. AIR AND GROUND (A&amp;G) COMSEC PROGRAM: The Air and Ground COMSEC Program procures and supports a wide range of secure encryption products supporting AF, inter-service, and various DoD agency customers; and includes items approved under National Security Agency's Commercial COMSEC Evaluation Program (CCEP) such as KIV-7M, Tactical fast lane (TACLANE), and other High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) devices.  The program includes equipment upgrades and replacements that incorporate state-of-the-art technologies for mission-critical warfighter secure voice and data communications.  The program provides needed upgrades to encryption devices in FY17 and FY18 to comply with NSA's Advanced Cryptographic Capabilities (ACC) directives. The program supports tactical, strategic, and network applications for globally deployed cryptologic assets supporting Air Force and DoD.  Supported systems fall within Air Force Information Systems Security and Information Assurance arenas.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0303140F. 
  
      a. IN-LINE NETWORK ENCRYPTORS: Previously called "Network Encryption Systems.”  FY18 funding fields the new In-Line Network Encryptors (INE) required to maintain the confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation of classified communications.  INEs are the mainstay for securing communications used in classified terrestrial and airborne communications networks.  The new INEs feature robust data encryption improvements included in the HAIPE Interoperability Specification (HAIPE IS) as well as Internet Protocol Version 6 capability that will improve security and expand the bandwidth of USAF secure Internet Protocol networks.
 
      b. LINK ENCRYPTION FAMILY (LEF):  FY18 funds provide for the replacement of the legacy LEF with new more secure crypto modernization compliant LEF devices.  The LEF provides near real time secure communications for national and command level decision making authorities up to TOP SECRET SCI.  The new LEF devices include more robust encryption algorithms, as well as dual channel, increased bandwidth capability, and reprogramability.  NSA has issued classified instructions regarding the use of specific LEF devices.
 
      c. AIR AND GROUND COMSEC CONSOLIDATED:  The following requirements have been combined into one line: Secure Telephones, COMSEC Acquisition Reform (CAR), Peculiar Support Equipment, Secure Communications Voice/Data, Embedded Encryption Devices, and Telemetry Encryption Devices.  FY18 funds procure secure voice/data equipment, DOD Type I COMSEC equipment and commercial cryptography products, testing and support equipment, embedded COMSEC modules, and telemetry devices and Link-16.  The Air and Ground COMSEC line is an aggregate of numerous items.  Each year the type and/or quantity of items utilized to meet requirements varies; an average unit cost is based on number/type of units planned for purchase.
 
3. CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION: The DoD is transforming its existing operational capabilities to realize a seamless joint network of information and engagement grids that securely link sensors, command and control cells, and tactical units to support current and future warfighting capabilities. This includes cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable allowing more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, reduced costs, and ensured Global Information Grid-compatibility. The Global Information Grid (GIG) requires a transformed cryptographic inventory. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization (CM) Initiative delivers that inventory, ensuring a strong security posture for national security and tactical communications systems by providing transparent cryptographic capabilities consistent with operational imperatives, National Security Agency mandates, and mission environments. The future inventory will provide security devices that ease logistics, support joint interoperability, improve interoperability with allies and coalition partners, enable network-centric and transparent key/equipment management, and allow effective future upgrades. These CM programs enable information dominance by developing and procuring communications security devices that deter and deny known and emerging threats while accommodating significantly increased bandwidths and processing speeds without increasing communication transient and information holding risk. Current CM programs will ensure modernized, secure communications capability to VINSON/ANDVT radios, the Identification Friend Foe (IFF) Mode 5 system, a Remote ReKey system for multiple Homeland Defense and other radar sites, the few remaining, unmodernized-Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) networks, and miniaturized crypto for small unmanned systems.  Current programs will replace/upgrade over 30,000 devices out of the Air Force's 245,000+ crypto devices and provided over 100,000 new devices where none were previously available. Other programs are undergoing development under the auspices of this line of this PE in order to meet emerging COMSEC requirements for Key Management Infrastructure compatibility, as well as various enterprise-wide technological upgrades mandated under the National Security Agency assessments and Policy #3-9 Cryptographic Modernization Initiative Requirements for Type 1 Cryptographic Products. Funding for this effort is in PE 0303140F. 
 
      a.

      g. CLASSIFIED DATA AT REST (CDAR):  CDAR will initially support four use cases that have been identified as high priority by CYSS and NSA:  Hard Disk (HDD) transfer, Large Manned ISR Platforms, Remotely Piloted Aircraft/Pods/Payloads, and Manned Tactical.  Pending results of an Alternative of Analysis, two of the four use cases may be solvable by the procurement of off-the-shelf encryption products.

      h. TRUSTED SENSOR (see item 3 under TD for description) 

      I. MINI CRYPTO (MC): Developing a Tactical Key Management (TKM) miniaturized cryptographic solution to protect Secret and Below (SaB) Command and Control (C2) and mission data for Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained platforms which currently have no cryptographic capability and transmit in the clear. MC's TKM solution has a self-generating key which removes the requirement for pre-placed keys and has the ability to add or remove users as tactical situation dictates.

 
4. AIR FORCE ELECTRONIC KEY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AFEKMS): AFEKMS is a part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME), a sustainment program that works in concert with the DoD EKMS Program to provide secure, flexible, and timely upgrades to cryptographic key generation, distribution, and management systems. AFEKMS sustains the current Electronic Key Management System and serves as the bridge to the full operational capability (FOC) of DoD KMI. The Air Force continues to purchase AF EKMS physical products required under the COMSEC Material Control System (CMCS). Funding for this effort is in program element 0303140F. 
 
      a. TECHNICAL UPDATES: FY18 funding procures hardware and software products necessary to update the Tier 1 Net Key Servers, Tier 3 system data management devices (DMDs); and systems to maintain an audit trail for COMSEC materials.

            <proc:Description>The Communications Security (COMSEC) modification activity ensures the integration, installation, and sustainment of cryptographic equipment. This activity is a critical component in providing robust, secure global communications, enabling information superiority. It provides the warfighter with the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision-making information through the retrofit and modification of selected COMSEC equipment. These modification efforts ensure legacy equipment can meet current COMSEC operational environment requirements. Funding for this effort is in program element (PE) 0303140F.

Modification 3080 funds were realigned to 3021 Space Procurement starting in FY17.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 and FY18 funding moved to appropriation 3021, Space Procurement.  FY16 funding provided replacement of critical components to maintain mission data life cycle requirements.  As the obsolescence of parts occurs in the sustainment of the products, modifications must be implemented to keep the products operational for satellite programs. Funds are used to update both cryptographic product end items and logistics lifecycle support elements.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>International Intelligence Technology and Architectures oversees, manages, and provides the United States (US) component of the multi-national Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (US BICES) with a collaborative environment and intelligence sharing enterprise required for processing and disseminating critical intelligence information between and among US, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), allied and coalition forces. The US BICES program procures and maintains a standing intelligence information sharing capability across Department of Defense (DoD), Combat Support Agencies, and multiple Combatant Commands (CCMD) for the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (USD (I)). At the request of USD (I), US BICES is extended beyond U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) into all CCMDs and is known as US BICES Extended (US BICES-X). US BICES provides an "enduring" US and Coalition interoperable intelligence sharing multi-level secure technical architecture utilizing releasable elements of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework and functions to support the full spectrum of intelligence operations and dissemination throughout the DoD community. Also, it enables instantiation of US BICES/BICES-X as the intelligence contribution to the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).

This is not a new start.  The funding was previously justified in another P-1 Line.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In response to CCMD requests, provides funding for extended use of US BICES-capabilities in support of USD (I) global intelligence sharing requirements.  Provides Computer Equipment Replacement Program (CERP) for the US BICES-X Enterprise. Procures hardware and software to support the continued build out and expansion of the US BICES-X/SOF BICES coalition information sharing capabilities to US Combatant Commanders and SOF units in support of on-going operations utilizing US BICES-X capabilities world-wide. Supports J2 (Joint Intelligence) network requirements to exchange intelligence information with bi-lateral, multi-lateral, and NATO partners. Will deliver procedures, workstations, switches, servers, cross-domain solutions, satellite bandwidth, microwave communications, video teleconference suites, network equipment, storage and backup, encryption equipment, software licenses, infrastructure, deployable suites, Trusted Network Environment (TNE) equipment and software communications. Variations in quantity and unit price reflect planned periodic refresh of equipment and software over the lifecycle of the system.

Other Procurement funding will:
- Provide and support extension of the US BICES multilateral, and BICES-like bilateral intelligence information sharing capabilities within each of the Unified Commands via expanded terrestrial and satellite communications, information technology systems, integrated wide area and meshed networking, deployable containers/elements, and advanced Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC)-IT/Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems (DCGS) releasable analytical
applications.
- Procure the hardware and software needed to establish US BICES-X capabilities as a core infrastructure and enterprise for the intelligence component of
the DoD Mission Partner Environment (MPE).
- Continue support to the (US as framework nation) US/Coalition Special Operations Forces (SOF) supporting NATO and worldwide intelligence needs for the Global Pursuit mission and the Intelligence Fusion Center at the Joint Analysis Center, United Kingdom (UK), in support of NATO.
- Procure work stations, enterprise hardware and software, security accreditation, and network connections supporting strategic, operational and forward deployed warfighting forces in multiple theaters.
- Provide for the Computer Equipment Replacement Program (CERP) upgrades to the US BICES-X Enterprise. These upgrades will provide cross domain solutions to support the reduction of barriers to information sharing with coalition partners identified in the Information Sharing Integrated Product Team Foreign Disclosure Report dated March 2010. The upgrades also consolidate and federate coalition support architectures across CCMDs to take advantage of US BICES-X based technologies to increase efficiencies.
- Provide initial capabilities for the establishment of a coalition baseline for the Special Operations Command Intelligence sharing capabilities.

            <proc:Description>Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) procures and supports fixed-base and tactical radar, navigation aids, voice communications, and data processing/automation capabilities which enables Air Force (AF) air traffic controllers to provide advisory, sequencing, separation, and landing guidance services to all aircraft in AF-assigned airspace.  In support of Global Mobility, Agile Combat Support, Global Strike, Homeland Security, and Global Response concepts of operation, ATCALS centrally manages the Air Force's Air Traffic Control capability to ensure Air Traffic Control facilities/equipment can safely and expeditiously support en route and terminal operations in benign and combat areas of responsibility.  ATCALS operational and training systems must be interoperable with systems operated by other services, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), or host nations. 


In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.


AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND AIRFIELD OPERATIONS (ATC OPS): ATC OPS provides for procurement of new systems and replacement, modification, or mitigation of diminishing manufacturing source issues of legacy ATC navigation and landing systems, as well as related voice communications, data processing/automation systems, and ancillary equipment such as ATC digital audio legal recorders, flight data input/output systems, electronic flight strip systems, air traffic information systems, instrument procedures, and airfield management systems.  A key element of ATC OPS is the ATCALS Fixed Base (FB) Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs) Family of Systems (FOS) replacement program, which combines organizational realignments, process improvements, and investments in state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf technology to replace legacy fixed and deployable equipment.  The FB NAVAIDS FOS replacement program includes the fixed base Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range System (VOR), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), and VORTAC (combined VOR/TACAN), Deployable TACAN, and Digital ATC radios.  ATC OPS also includes procurement of a new Deployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS) and Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON) which will replace 1960/1970s era legacy systems.  These investments will result in significant manpower and operations/maintenance savings over the next 20 years. 

1.  DIGITAL AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) RADIO REPLACEMENT: The ATC ground-to-air VHF and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radios are 30 years old and difficult to maintain.  The Digital ATC Radio Replacement Program will replace ATC fixed-base radios with state-of-the-art systems that will include a remote maintenance capability and 8.33kHz channel spacing (mandatory requirement in Europe by FY2018).  In order to ensure system commonality and common logistics support and training, ATC radios are being procured as a centrally managed item by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Tinker AFB.  Approximately 5,200 radios will be replaced. 

2.  ATCALS Fixed Base (FB) Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS) FoS: The FB NAVAIDs FOS replaces the current 1970s era systems which have reached the end of their normal lifespan, are manpower intensive, and costly to support.  New systems will include remote maintenance, monitoring, alignment, and flight inspection support capabilities via Remote Maintenance Centers (RMC).  One VOR (1 AD), 28 VORTACs (25 AD/1 ANG/2 AFR), and 92 fixed-based TACANs (76 AD/10 ANG/6 AFR) will be procured from FY2012 through FY2018.

3. DEPLOYABLE INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM (D-ILS): D-ILS is a deployable Category I (200ft decision height/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities.  D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions to support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian/disaster relief operations and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet in the area of responsibility.  D-ILS replaces the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system.  These systems were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable.  On average, only four of 14 mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis and none are fully mission capable. Two ILSs are required to replace each PAR, one for each end of the primary runway (the mobile PAR is mounted on a turntable which allows it to be rotated to cover the operational runway end).  A total of 30 D-ILSs will be procured to replace four Active Duty and ten Air National Guard (ANG) mobile PARs.  One training system and one depot rotable system will also be procured.  D-ILS is normally deployed with the Deployable Radar Approach Control System, a mobile Air Traffic Control Tower, and mobile TACAN.   

4.  DEPLOYABLE RADAR APPROACH CONTROL SYSTEM (D-RAPCON): D-RAPCON will replace the 1960/1970s era AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar and Operations Shelter subsystems with state-of-the-art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  On average, due to systemic equipment failures, no more than four of the existing 14 systems are deployable at any given time and none are fully mission capable.  The current AN/TPN-19 (four systems) and AN/MPN-14K (ten systems) operational availability rates are 25% and 60% respectively versus the D-RAPCON requirement of 98%.  D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance/sequencing, air traffic control communications, and automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations.  D-RAPCON will also be deployed with a D-ILS, mobile control tower, and mobile TACAN to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) will increase from 120 nm up to 200 nm.  Due to diminishing manufacturing sources, life of type purchases will be required each year.  A total of 16 D-RAPCONs will be procured.  Four for the Active Duty (three for the 53rd ir Traffic Control Squadron (ATCS) at Robins AFB, one for the 1st ATCS at Ramstein AF, one trainer, and one depot rotable) and one for each of 10 ANG ATCSs.

Current year funding totals include $42.650M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

            <proc:Description>PE 0305137F NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM (NAS)

NAS is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC (Component) program which entered full rate production on 15 Jun 05.  It modernizes the Department of Defense (DoD) Air Traffic Control (ATC) system in concert with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) modernization effort.  The FAA is the overall NAS program lead and the Air Force (AF) is the DoD lead.  NAS increases safety of flight, provides systems and facilities interoperable with FAA modernization, replaces aging DoD ATC systems, provides identical service to military and civilian aircraft, and reduces DoD flight cancellations/delays and maintenance.  Equipment procured includes ATC automation systems, surveillance radars, voice switches, military site-unique equipment (at test range facilities), associated Pre-Planned Product Improvements, site preparation, installation support, ancillary equipment and supplies, direct production support, and flight, periodic security interoperability, and information technology certifications.  For the AF, this includes procurement funding for 91 DoD Advanced Automation Systems (DAASs) [45 Radar Approach Control Facilities and 46 Air Traffic Control Towers], 50 Digital Airport Surveillance Radars (DASRs), and other equipment required to interface with the FAA.
 
DAAS replaces the 1978 era Programmable Indicator Data Processor and is comprised of equipment tailored to support two types of ATC operations facilities: Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) and military control tower facilities.  DAAS includes digital radar displays, consoles, and automation hardware and software to replace systems approaching the end of their life cycle.  

DASR replaces the current generation of DoD analog ATC surveillance radars and consists of two subsystems: a primary and a secondary surveillance radar.  These subsystems provide aircraft position and other data to controller displays in the RAPCON and at select control tower locations.    

To date, the NAS program has procured and installed 48 DASR and 91 DAAS systems.  To support increased remotely piloted aircraft operations, there are two additional DASRs remaining to be procured and installed: one funded with FY15 funds (approved in FY16 Omnibus Above Threshold request) at Nellis AFB and one funded in FY18 for Creech AFB.  The NAS FOC will occur in FY20 with installation of the Creech DASR.  NAS is also transitioning to the operations and support phase which will focus on mitigation of DAAS/DASR diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) and sustainment issues. Funds for NAS sustainment modifications are being programmed in the Communications Electronics Modification P-1 Line #49 under the NAS program element 0305137F.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.  Reserve component allocations are subject to Total Force priorities and demand.  

PE 0305114F AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND LANDING SYSTEMS (ATCALS)

ATCALS procures and supports fixed-base and tactical radar, navigation aids, voice communications, and data processing/automation capabilities.  ATCALS enables Air Force (AF) air traffic controllers to provide advisory, sequencing, separation, and landing guidance services to all aircraft in AF-assigned airspace.  NAS support in the ATALS PE 0305114F currently includes procurement of one DAAS for the ATCALS/DAAS Operational Support Facility (OSF) at the Air Force Flight Standards Agency in Oklahoma City, OK.

            <proc:Description>BCS-F supports the North American Aerospace Defense Command/ Northern Command (NORAD/NORTHCOM) homeland defense and air sovereignty mission for fixed Air Defense Sectors.

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED (BCS-F): BCS-F is a Bi-national program with Canada. The BCS-F Program is an AF Homeland Defense battle management command and control system with the capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive air picture. BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space. This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression. The BCS-F baseline expanded in FY2014 to include the Remote Tactical Air Picture/Remote Work Station (RTAP/RWS). Tech refresh will be required, to prevent system obsolescence, account for new cyber-security requirements and will posture the program to seamlessly integrate future capabilities.

NATIONAL CAPITOL REGION - INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM (NCR-IADS): NCR-IADS is a post-September 11, 2001 rapidly fielded capability that improves low altitude detection capability in order to prosecute airborne threats to the NCR. NCR-IADS provides ground-based air defense of the National Capitol Region airspace, and provides an integrated air picture, ground air defense weapons, enhanced regional situational awareness and forensic data collection capabilities for the war-fighter mission to protect the NCR. Tech refresh will be required, to prevent system obsolescence, account for new cyber- security requirements and will posture the program to seamlessly integrate future capabilities.

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM MODIFICATION: Provides for capital equipment replacement activities at the fixed Air Defense Sector under the modification efforts for Release 3.2.4 and beyond, which include, but are not limited to: infrastructure upgrades, future Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), and replacement of other equipment that does not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM) funding.  Tech refresh will be required, to prevent system obsolescence, account for new cyber-security requirements and will posture the program to seamlessly integrate future capabilities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>- Battle Control System-Fixed (BCS-F) INC 3 program ended after reaching full deployment in November 2012: No FY2018 funds requested.
- National Capitol Region - Integrated Air Defense System (NCR-IADS): Tech refresh will be required to prevent system obsolescence, account for new cyber- security requirements and will posture the program to seamlessly integrate future capabilities.
- BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM MODIFICATION UPGRADES: FY2018 funds will support hardware upgrades for G7 servers. Funds will also provide hardware upgrades and spares that do not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM) funding, to include, but not limited to: updated configurations of existing sites to match the modified baseline, and hardware for increased cyber security capability to maintain Authority to Operate (ATO).
- PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA): FY2018 funds for PMA costs provide the management, engineering and technical support for the program office.
- This funding request supports potential Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>PE 0207412F CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER (CRC)

The Control and Reporting Center (CRC) is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It consists of facilities, equipment, and people. It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations. The CRC is a family of systems which includes: AN/TYQ-23(V)1 Operations Module (OM) (to be replaced by  the AN/TYQ-23v5), a low density/high demand (LD/HD), rapidly deployable, ground-based C2 asset that features an automated, computer-based information system to provide operators with a real-time battle space picture necessary to plan, direct, and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks; AN/TSC-147 Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Module (JM) (to be replaced by the Link 16 Upgrade using the Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS)); AN/TRC-213/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS); and the AN/TPS-75 Radar, CRC's organic radar, (to be replaced by the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR) (PE 0207455)).  Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues. 

In order to meet warfighter requirements, incremental updates are required. Phase 1 capabilities include, but are not limited to: JM Link 16 Upgrade kits and DMSMS updates (JM Link 16 Upgrade will provide for crypto modernization and will meet FAA mandated frequency re-mapping requirements, as well as stand up organic software and hardware support); Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet) connectivity in order to fulfill mission requirements; and a Cross Domain Solution (CDS) to update cyber security. Fielding and DMSMS updates and interim contract support will continue through FY21.

            <proc:Description>PE 0305111F WEATHER SERVICE 

The Weather Observation Forecast procurement line acquires meteorological equipment and ground-based space environment sensing systems supporting the global missions of the Air Force (AF), Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), combatant commands, and other government agencies. Additionally, these funds procure information system equipment for processing, storing, and disseminating weather information for analysis, forecasting, and mission integration at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Fixed and transportable equipment provides observing and forecasting capabilities for home station and deployed locations in support of worldwide Air and Space Expeditionary Forces and Army forces. Weather system technological upgrades provide critical support to modern air and space combat operations. These systems enhance the effectiveness and survivability of AF weapon systems and precision munitions by accurately predicting environmental impacts to optimize mission execution and planning, targeting, weaponeering, and battle damage assessment, as well as space systems operations and effectiveness. Management services costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and Advisory and Assistance Services. 

AF Weather Weapon System (AFWWS) activities align under four capability areas: 1) Weather Data Collection, 2) Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, 3) Weather Forecasting, and 4) Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications. This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions. Development funding for Weather Observation/Forecast is in Program Element (PE) 0305111F, Weather Service. 

1. Weather Data Collection: Provides automated atmospheric (a.k.a. terrestrial) and space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide. The data gathered by multiple sensor systems is exploited for environmental battlespace awareness, characterization, safety of flight, and resource protection. Items A-D (below) were formerly consolidated as "Observing System 21st Century (OS-21)." 

A. AN/FMQ-23: Fixed automated weather observing system that collects weather elements and formulates aviation surface weather reports. 

B. Next Generation Ionosonde (NEXION): Ionospheric Ground Sensors (IGS) capital equipment replacement consists replacement of unsupportable, functionally obsolete, and inoperable NEXION, Ionospheric Scintillation Total Electron Count Observer (ISTO), and other similar equipment. IGS data is transmitted via Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) to ACC/557th Weather Wing and is utilized to show real-time impacts to DoD Satellite Communication (SATCOM) users; and provide geo-location; Global Positioning System (GPS) error and corrections, and comm forecasts. NEXION is a Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) vertical incidence low-power radar sensor that obtains measurements of the ionosphere from directly overhead in the medium and high frequency radio bands (2-30 MHz). Ionospheric Scintillation Total Electron Count Observer (ISTO) is a world-wide network of COTS, ground-based, passive, multi-frequency receivers that measure ionospheric scintillation and total electron content in real-time by analyzing various satellite signals. This is not a new start.

C. Portable Doppler Radar (PDR): Transportable Doppler weather radar system that provides situational awareness via detection of precipitation and wind patterns in forward areas in support of combat operations. System is COTS.  System was previously purchased in FY13. This purchase will replace systems worn out by constant use at deployed locations and for new deployed locations requiring a PDR.

2. Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination: Assimilates worldwide sources of atmospheric and space weather data, produces decision-quality information for warfighters, and disseminates those products to intermediate and end users via a net-centric interface ensuring data integrity and continuity of service. Weather data formats and transmission protocols support DoD's Data Services Environment and Meteorological and Oceanographic Community of Interest objectives for integration into warfighter command and control, mission planning, and modeling and simulation systems. Improved analysis of real-time weather information supports DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System and enhances Air Force energy security plans. 

A. Weather Data Analysis(WDA)-The Weather Data Analysis (WDA) program of record provides a large-scale data processing, product generation, and presentation system supporting Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) services architecture and providing capability to ingest, process, store, access, and disseminate meteorological oceanographic (METOC) data. DoD Warfighter Capability/Benefits include the following; centralized Weather Web Service capability, increased availability of weather impacts and products, improved global, regional, and execution forecasts, specific, mission tailored weather data on demand, and finally integrated M2M interfaces that shorten the Combatant Command (COCOM) kill chain. Additionally, WDA provides data storage and network infrastructure supporting production, development,and testing activities and transport of data among multiple nodes and classification levels. Specifically, Enterprise Storage provides storage and the capability to move data between various storage devices.  Ingest Services ensure data providers can present their data to designated storage and Dissemination Services and ensure data consumers have access to storage and/or the ability to move data to location specified by the consumer. Ingest, Dissemination, and Storage services are provided in Non-classified Internet Protocol Router (NIPR), Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR), and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) for Production, Test and Development activities in varying degrees. All aspects of Enterprise Storage are in the approved architecture, bound by best security practice principles, in an effort to meet security requirements, standardize, and eliminate one-off solutions,wherever possible.   

3. Weather Forecasting: Provides numerical weather prediction, cloud, space environment, and atmospheric constituent (e.g., aerosols) forecast models and other environmental forecast products for worldwide AF, Army, SOF, space, and national intelligence community operational support. Uses high-performance computer servers and high-capacity storage for atmospheric and space weather modeling and worldwide environmental forecast products within DoD Data Center 14866. 

A. Numerical Weather Modeling (NWM)--Provides atmospheric and space weather modeling and worldwide environmental forecast products supporting military and intelligence operations worldwide. 

Supports technology insertion/scientific improvements and sustainment to USAF weather analysis and forecasting capability with emphasis on clouds, theater-scale weather, and aerosol/chemical constituents.  Provides improvements to specific weather capability gaps to Joint/USAF mission areas, and provides forecast products to create advisories and warnings for DoD resource protection.

4. Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications: 
Provides timely, local and regional target-scale weather information to operational commanders within a given Area of Responsibility and at tactical levels provides front-line weather information to warfighters in support of combat operations. Supports the 'train as you fight' concept by assuring fixed and deployable systems have a similar performance parameters and user interfaces. 

A. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)--Provides a standard AF Weather forecaster toolkit to ingest weather data and deliver timely, tailorable, precise weather impacts to the warfighter.

Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) are highly structured, authenticated messages primarily used in the command and control of nuclear forces. They are disseminated over numerous survivable and non-survivable communication systems including terrestrial and space systems. Programmed funds procure system components, spares, software, and necessary support services for systems such as the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS), the Defense Injection Reception Emergency Action Message (EAM) C2 Terminals (DIRECT), Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE), the Strategic Emergency Action Transmission System (SEATS), and the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN).   SACCS is a secure Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) system that directly supports National Command Authority (NCA) communications in the command and control of strategic and non-strategic forces. SACCS enables the NCA to disseminate Higher Authority Command Messages, Force Direction Messages, EAMs, and automated ICBM re-targeting data to the USAF's two legs (ICBM and bomber fleets) of the nuclear triad; the reconnaissance, tanker, USAFE munitions, and Special Operations communities; and to other Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve DoD users worldwide. DIRECT includes the hardware and software to enable the NCA to transmit nuclear and non-nuclear EAMs and other time-critical messages to strategic and non-strategic forces. The equipment requested is representative of those items capable of providing the required operational capability. The specific items procured may vary depending upon available technology at the time of procurement. Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Development funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0101316F.

The COCOM's MCCC provides a survivable and endurable command, control, communications, computers, intelligence (C4I), reliability and maintainability while accomplishing directed COCOM missions.  The MCCC provides C4I for Homeland Security Support/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) and USNORTHCOM missions.  MCCC modification efforts funded in this line include upgrading MCCC shelters and incorporating additional C4I system capabilities via mobile Information Technology and Communication Upgrade projects; ensuring the platform's ability to rapidly deploy, re-constitute and operate.  In FY18, this line will fund the MCCC Block 01 modifications  which include but are not limited to: 1) Communication system upgrade; 2) Mission and support shelters upgrade; 3) Cyber security modernization, 4) Network upgrades; and 5) Environmental and Filtration system upgrade along with and including initial spares and test facility updates required by the fielding of these modification.  Due to the limited spares demand rates, and indefinite system lifespan, Life of Type buys may be required to support weapons system modifications across the active MCCC Block Programs.  Additionally, FY18 funding will support Program Management Administration (PMA) support for the MCCC Block 00 Program initiated in FY17, the MCCC Block 01 program initiated with FY18 funding, and finally the planning efforts for the MCCC Block 02 program.  PMA includes acquisition support/strategy, engineering and technical expertise associated with procurement, support services, test, travel and other program related costs associated with install of procurement equipment.  Funding for this effort is in program element 0305903F and is funded IAW full funding policy.

            <proc:Description>The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Hardware program procures commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) computing systems hardware and hardware-related requirements for Air Force active duty, Guard, and Reserve units worldwide.  These computing systems provide a flexible, configurable and cost-effective range of increasing capability to meet the continuum of peacetime, contingency and wartime planning requirements.  These electronic systems provide a mission data management system that efficiently interfaces with other planning systems as well as aircraft avionics.  These computing systems are procured on a four-year life cycle replacement to effectively address and/or alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Once procured the systems are centrally managed for all applicable AF platforms and their operational users, including Guard and Reserve Forces.

The program continues the procurement of COTS computing hardware and other devices associated with the Mission Planning Systems program.  It also continues the procurement of all capital replacement hardware used in conjunction with MPS and other pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning software.  Together this hardware and associated software enables aircrews and other planners to plan the safest, most effective operational missions in a timely manner.  

The program procures COTS based Personal Computing (PC) Systems to include (but are not limited to) desktop computers, laptops, personal digital assistants (PDA), tablet PCs, color printers, storage devices, displays, other peripherals, software and software licenses, and other support services, that together, allow the user to produce the necessary charts and other mission-specific products required to effectively perform a variety of military missions. 

A variety of information technology, navigation and communications hardware and software packages will also be procured each year to meet the varied needs of mission planning platforms and training units.  This PC-based capability, when integrated with corresponding mission planning software releases, provides a portable, tailorable, net-centric system for aircrews to complete the mission planning function.  The procured items also enable aircrews to effectively utilize software that has been modified to stay in sync with new capabilities incorporated into select platforms via their Operational Flight Program (OFP) update process.  They also provide a mission planning capability for precision/autonomous guided munitions and can also be networked with other Theater Battle Management (TBM) systems to further tailor a platform's mission planning environment. 

The MPS procurement strategy leverages the rapid increase in PC-based technology to enable high-end computing on increasingly smaller and more mission-oriented devices.  The programs procure UNIX and PC-based systems that provide flexible, configurable, and cost effective solutions that increase tactical and strategic capabilities to meet the continuum of operations ranging from peacetime contingencies to conventional and nuclear wartime mission planning requirements.  Each segment of the program has shifted its hardware emphasis from a limited number of large, complex planning systems to more compact and personal planning devices that can be tailored to satisfy user needs.  This adjustment is a practical and efficient way to meet technology-driven challenges such as the evolutionary nature of mission planning (that necessitates recurrent hardware changes to meet overall system requirements) and advances in COTS technology that makes available new capabilities (which may lower component costs or address component obsolescence).  It is also a more effective way to address changes in the number, type, and deployment of aircraft/weapons that force changes in the number of UNIX and PC-based mission planning computers and their concept of operations.  

1. MISSION PLANNING SYSTEMS (MPS) HARDWARE:  This acquisition is a continuation of procurement efforts to provide MPS-related hardware for Air Force platforms.  The program will provide a suite of COTS-based mission planning hardware and software systems that can be integrated with USAF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems for the operation of USAF aircraft (e.g. F-22, B-1, F-16, F-15, RC/OC-135, E-3, E-4, E-8, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, HH-60, KC-135, KC-46, C-5, KC-10, C-17, A-10, F-35, Global Hawk, U-2, B-52, B-2, UH-1, T-38) and the support of USAF training requirements.  MPS allows aircrews to electronically receive tasking orders, intelligence information, target coordinates, imagery and other information.  This information is then used to organize and prepare flight (including equipment and personnel airdrop) and weapons delivery planning data (e.g., maps, charts, imagery, flight logs, radar predications, and navigation databases) that is electronically transferred to aircraft and/or precision-guided weapons.  MPS increases the combat effectiveness of Air Force aerial assets (including unmanned air vehicles, conventional and low-observable aircraft, and weapons) and Army guided delivery systems by supporting the use of sophisticated avionics and precision/autonomous guided munitions.  It helps to increase wartime sortie rates while improving aircrew and aircraft survivability and aircrew readiness.

2. PRECISION AERIAL DELIVERY SYSTEM (PADS): PADS provides the capability for direct delivery of cargo and equipment through high altitude, precision airdrops (principally with C-17 and C-130 aircraft).  Currently it consists of the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) acquisition effort.  JPADS is a collaborative effort with the Army, USMC, and other agencies to provide aviators the ability to accurately airdrop payloads (including supplies/equipment and personnel) to units in the field from altitudes beyond the reach of some surface-to-air weaponry.  This portion of the program procures COTS-based computing hardware, support services and aerial delivery systems to enable completion of pre and in-flight mission planning functions as well as aerial delivery proficiency training in and with operational units. 
 
Market surveys and analysis of COTS products will be used to support procurement decisions.  Funding for this exhibit is in Program Element (PE) 0208006F.

This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>INTEGRATED STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ANALYSIS NETWORK (ISPAN):  The mission of USSTRATCOM is to conduct global operations in coordination with other Combatant Commands, Services, and appropriate U.S. Government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the U.S. and its allies.  It provides full-spectrum global strike, and coordinated space, missile defense, and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives.  USSTRATCOM will also provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  ISPAN enables USSTRATCOM to carry out these missions.  It is one of DoD's most complex classified computer systems and the only national force level planning system.

ISPAN enables an effects-based approach to planning and operations; cross domain information sharing; and serves multiple planning environments.  It develops, verifies, and produces Operational Plan (OPLAN) 8010.  It also supports the USSTRATCOM family of plans construct and current Concept of Operations.  The system performs tasks ranging from creating and running Courses of Action (COAs) on threat scenarios to providing data for developing bomber aircraft crew strike mission data in digital and hard copy formats.  It includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), multiple networks, unique processes and procedures, software, training, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, a test/development environment, and subsidiary systems.  The system will migrate to the new USSTRATCOM Command and Control Facility. 

The ISPAN program is comprised of two independent but complementary planning systems; the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) and the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP-CIE).  

MPAS is an automated information system to support Global Strike nuclear and conventional target development and weaponeering.  MPAS includes Mission Planning, Analysis, and Decision Support tools and an Enterprise Database to sustain and support nuclear and conventional strategic war planning.

GAP-CIE provides web-enabled adaptive planning, rapid distributed Course of Action (COA) development and global situational awareness supporting both contingency and crisis planners.  
ISPAN uses a four-year life-cycle replacement plan to procure required Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware (e.g. servers, storage devices, workstations, peripherals and other network components).  

In some instances the hardware must be combined with commercially available software to form unique planning environments.  The programs  life cycle replacement plan for hardware follows industry standards and is used to eliminate the peaks and valleys associated with maintaining compatibility with the fast moving COTS hardware technology improvement cycle.  It also allows the program to better utilize existing manpower to install and configure the hardware systems to provide an incremental and efficient replacement of critical infrastructure components as they become obsolete.  Hardware and software procured within the program is used to support all ISPAN program increments.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in Program Element 0101313F.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>Due to the lifecycle of commercial satellites, Eagle Vision must update the system to retain the capability of downlinking imagery.  As one commercial satellite constellation is decommissioned, Eagle Vision must procure hardware and software of a new satellite to allow for downlinking from the new satellite system.  Currently Eagle Vision contains the hardware and software to receive downlinking from SPOT 6/7, TerraSAR-X/TANDEM-X, and Worldview satellites.  Eagle Vision Block II will acquire the Pleiades 1A/1B downlinking capability and upgrade the dissemination performance to the Data Integration Segment (DIS).</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM AIR FORCE (GCCS-AF): The GCCS-AF program provides the common AF infrastructure hardware and software necessary to pass AF command and control (C2) data among commands, their components, and the joint GCCS. This program procures GCCS components which include items such as servers, work stations, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, and associated peripherals to provide users with the full suite of joint baseline capability (including the common operating picture) and AF specific applications such as the Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) and Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) that feed into the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES). GCCS-AF is integrated at the following locations to establish initial and full joint connectivity and operational capability across the spectrum of intelligence, operations, manpower, and logistics: AF-supported war-fighting commands, AF critical sites, Headquarters United States Air Force, Major Command headquarters (MAJCOM), numbered air forces, wings, Air National Guard (ANG) bases, Air Force Reserve (AFR) bases, and remote sites. Each site will comply with current Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) network initiatives by employing a standardized interface among AF base-level classified C2 networks, AF base-level network control centers, and the joint Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This program provides a flexible open system and distributed C2 architecture necessary to support the joint GCCS. GCCS supports AF operations by installing and upgrading a site's classified C2 system through extensive use of COTS technology that adheres to AF command and control, communications, and computer architectures and standards. 

NOTE: FY2018 reflects a GCCS-AF funding decrease of $10.223M as this funding was transferred to PE 0207452F (DCAPES) as they assume responsibility for the Strategic Server Enclave (SSE) and Windows baselines for this program.

Funding for the exhibit contained in PE 0303150F: GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM AIR FORCE (GCCS-AF): FY18 procurement funding procures various types and quantities of hardware and software in support of installation and unit mission
requirements for Air Force personnel. GCCS-AF will procure and install GCCS-Joint (GCCS-J) version 6.0 hardware and software (government-off- the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf) at warfighter Combatant Command (CCMD) and MAJCOM locations, providing a full spectrum of command, control, logistics, and intelligence capability from strategic to unit level operations with total joint service connectivity. The GCCS architecture supports functional users on each base and specifically incorporates manpower and logistics functions into GCCS. These fielding activities are consistent with the AF's Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) C2 structure and integration with DoD's emerging next generation joint C2 enabler.</proc:Justification>

PE 0401840F MOBILITY COMMAND AND CONTROL:

GLOBAL MOBILITY COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) ARCHITECTURE AIR MOBILITY COMMAND (AMC): The AMC C2 architecture is an integrated, command-wide program that supports US Air Force airlift/air refueling missions around the globe with centralized control/decentralized execution. To execute America's Global Reach mission, Air Mobility Command's 618th Air Operations Center (AOC) plans, schedules, and directs a fleet of more than 1,100 mobility aircraft.  The 618th AOC operates combat delivery, strategic airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation operations around the world. Funding for this exhibit contained in program element (PE) 0401840F. 

a. MOBILITY AIR FORCE (MAF) COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) INFRASTRUCTURE:  Provides base wired/wireless infrastructure equipment supporting AMC's 618th AOC and AMC's 12 bases to assure connectivity to AMC's command and control (C2) systems and to ensure they remain operational at AMC bases and operating locations.  MAF C2 Infrastructure ensures connectivity with critical Air Force systems such as the Information Transport System (ITS), Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and the Global Decision Support System (GDSS); AMC's C2 systems such as the Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) and Advanced Computer Flight Planning (ACFP) system and the infrastructure for Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems across AMC providing intra-base command and control for base security, emergency management, flightline operations/maintenance, and crash response.  

b. DEPLOYED SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS (DSATCOM):  Provides C2 communications capabilities for deployed Mobility C2 forces and mission support team C2 operations.  These operations rapidly install mission support communications at austere base locations where communications to support air mobility operations are nonexistent or insufficient.  The DSATCOM program is the primary funding vehicle for procuring communications equipment supporting these components.  The resources directly support C2 and In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of deployed and enroute personnel, aircraft, and cargo providing critical communications to Contingency Response Groups (CRGs).  CRGs are self-sufficient groups of multi-skilled, highly-trained airmen, representing different Air Force specialty codes, who can rapidly deploy anywhere in the world with little notice to open air bases for any follow-on mission.  The Hard-side Expandable Lightweight Air Mobile Shelter (HELAMS) is the primary weapon system providing this support.  It is a rapidly deployable, self-contained C2/ITV command center.  This shelter functions as the base command post during the initial phases of airbase build-up and contains integrated communications equipment such as radios, computers, printers and fax machines. No funding is required for DSATCOM after FY16.

Special Operations Forces PE 0404011F - P-40A
PE 0404011F Special Operations Forces:

Command and Control (C2) Air Rapid Response Kits (ARRKs) are tailored packages providing temporary base operating support (BOS)(i.e., SOF living facilities, command and control (C2), armory, fuel storage, water purification, and cold weather protection), which allow Air Force Special Operations Forces (AFSOFs) to perform expeditionary deployments to austere environments before conventional/service-common BOS packages become available.  FY16 funding totals include $2M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

DoD downsizing, reductions in forward basing, and aircraft technology advances evolved AF weapons systems into increasingly valuable national power projection capabilities. However, the security afforded most AF aircraft, weapon systems, other critical resources, and associated personnel and facilities in terms of equipment or manpower has not kept pace with the changing world environment, state-of-the-art technology and potential threats. The emergence of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) has led to additional command, control and communications nodes that require commensurate protection level security efforts to enable effective Air Force power projection. Force Protection BPSS projects support long-term physical security requirements which allow installation commanders and security forces to adapt to, and counter, enduring and emergent threats to high priority assets in accordance with home station and the Aerospace Expeditionary Force concept.

                    <proc:Description>INTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE SECURITY SYSTEM (IBDSS): Reduces the risk to AF personnel; nuclear (PL-1N), and non-nuclear (PL 1-4) assets (weapon systems, aircraft, command &amp; control systems,etc.) and facilities (hangars, SCIFs, etc.) at AF and ANG installations globally. DoD downsizing, reductions in forward basing, and aircraft technology advances evolved AF weapons systems into increasingly
valuable national power projection capabilities. However, the security afforded most AF aircraft, weapon systems, other critical resources, and associated personnel and facilities in terms of equipment or manpower has not kept pace with the changing world environment, state-of-the-art technology and potential threats. The emergence of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) has led to additional command, control and communications nodes that require commensurate protection level security efforts to enable effective Air Force power projection. Force Protection BPSS projects support long-term physical security requirements which allow installation commanders and security forces to adapt to, and counter, enduring and emergent threats to high priority assets in accordance with home station and the Aerospace Expeditionary Force concept. This continuing effort was previously named Base Physical Security Systems and is not a New Start.

INTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE SECURITY SYSTEM (IBDSS): FY18 Funding is provided for procurement, design &amp; engineering, modeling &amp; simulation, infrastructure and allied support, installation, integration, training, acceptance testing, Interim Contractor Support (ICS) and interim spares for Base Physical Security Systems (BPSS) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The funding also procures, installs and sustains a variety of electronic security alarms, sensors, and related systems to detect and provide early warning of potential threats against Air Force Protection Level (PL) 1,2,3, and 4 mission critical assets. Funding also supports the Nuclear (PL-1N) Weapon Storage Areas (WSAs) located throughout the CONUS and vault storage areas at main operating bases in Europe to meet long term physical security requirements in the face of enduring and emerging threats. This also includes upgrading existing system to ensure required capability for vault storage areas and associated intrusion detection, access control and assessment systems requirements, In Accordance With (IAW) USAF, EUCOM and NATO/SHAPE requirements. The funds also provide for upgrades, refurbishment, replacement or installation of new fences (required for sensor platforms) and/or lighting systems (to support the surveillance/assessment functions).  Due to world-wide operational mission events, quantities are subject to change.

We are currently restructuring IBDSS into discrete block upgrades.

Milestone/Development Status

For Force Protection Commercial Off The Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use. This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C 3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.

                    <proc:Description>INTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE SECURITY SYSTEM (IBDSS-1): Reduces the risk to AF personnel; nuclear (PL-1N), and non-nuclear (PL 1-4) assets (weapon systems, aircraft, command &amp; control systems, etc.) and facilities (hangars, SCIFs, etc.) at AF and ANG installations globally. DoD downsizing, reductions in forward basing, and aircraft technology advances evolved AF weapons systems into increasingly valuable national power projection capabilities. However, the security afforded most AF aircraft, weapon systems, other critical resources, and associated personnel and facilities in terms of equipment or manpower has not kept pace with the changing world environment, state-of-the-art technology and potential threats. The emergence of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) has led to additional command, control and communications nodes that require commensurate protection level security efforts to enable effective Air Force power projection. Force Protection BPSS projects support long-term physical security requirements which allow installation commanders and security forces to adapt to, and counter, enduring and emergent threats to high priority assets in accordance with home station and the Aerospace Expeditionary Force concept. This continuing effort was previously named Base Physical Security Systems and is not a New Start.

INTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE SECURITY SYSTEM (IBDSS-1): FY18 Funding is provided for procurement, design &amp; engineering, modeling &amp; simulation, infrastructure and allied support, installation, integration, training, acceptance testing, Interim Contractor Support (ICS) and interim spares for Base Physical Security Systems (BPSS) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The funding also procures, installs and sustains a variety of electronic security alarms, sensors, and related systems to detect and provide early warning of potential threats against Air Force Protection Level (PL) 1,2,3, and 4 mission critical assets. Funding also supports the Nuclear (PL-1N) Weapon Storage Areas (WSAs) located throughout the CONUS and vault storage areas at main operating bases in Europe to meet long term physical security requirements in the face of enduring and emerging threats. This also includes upgrading existing system to ensure required capability for vault storage areas and associated intrusion detection, access control and assessment systems requirements, In Accordance With (IAW) USAF, EUCOM and NATO/SHAPE requirements. The funds also provide for upgrades, refurbishment, replacement or installation of new fences (required for sensor platforms) and/or lighting systems (to support the surveillance/assessment functions).  Due to world-wide operational mission events, quantities are subject to change.


We are currently restructuring IBDSS into discrete block upgrades.

Milestone/Development Status

For Force Protection Commercial Off The Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use. This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C 3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.

            <proc:Description>The Combat Training Range program procures electronic telecommunication and instrumentation equipment and threat systems for training ranges worldwide to satisfy EW training capability requirements. It also procures range scoring systems and replacement equipment for electronics no longer logistically supportable. This P-1 line also procures Target Control System (TCS) ground subsystems for target drones.

PE 0207429F COMBAT TRAINING RANGE EQUIPMENT

JOINT THREAT EMITTER (JTE): The Joint Threat Emitter is designed to train aircrews to survive in a combat environment against Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) threats. The JTE simulates a range of threat signals, in multiple emitter kits, which interact with the aircraft Radar Warning Receiver and Electronic Countermeasure system to provide realistic Electronic Warfare training environments for pilots and crew members. The JTE is intended to reduce range manpower and resource requirements by replacing legacy systems as they face increasing supportability issues. The JTE leverages Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) where possible to provide digital signal generation and feedback across its range of threats. The JTE system uses a command-and-control unit (C2U) to operate a Threat Emitter Unit (TEU) producing a realistic threat environment for 4th and 5th Generation aircraft. Funding will also be used to purchase services applicable to the acquisition, site activation and implementation of the ground system including range site surveys, installation and training.  The program also procures modifications for obsolete components for the fielded JTE fleet to extend their serviceable life.  Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

RANGE EQUIPMENT: This effort delivers range infrastructure and equipment. One such effort is the Joint Advanced Weapon Scoring System (JAWSS) program, which consists of Navy-developed scoring systems that upgrade the weapon (bombing and gunnery) and laser spot scoring on ranges. The equipment provide multiple new capabilities, to include scoring of day or night operations, production of a data stream with immediate displays, and results transmission to the pilot providing immediate feedback previously unavailable to aircrew. Other Electronic Warfare (EW) threat subsystems such as noise and spoofing jammers as well as radar and detection systems, data link connectivity and target shells will be procured in order to monitor and control an extended, realistic target environment for simulated ordnance delivery and aircrew training for airborne laser designators.

RANGE COMMUNICATIONS: The Range Communication (RIMCOM) program provides communication systems to connect various simulated surface-to-air (SAM) threat systems on Air Force ranges to simulate an integrated air defense system (IADS) and to provide blue force command and control for range operations. Infrastructure modernization includes replacing obsolete equipment, establishing a common infrastructure to support a future Live Mission Operations Center (LMOC) capability enabling improved mission debriefs and Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) aircrew training, and standardization of all training range communications systems to support LVC training missions. This program focuses on procurement of range communication infrastructure equipment, including fiber optic cabling, microwave, UHF, and VHF radios and antennas, data links and repeater stations, power subsystems, control systems, and cryptological equipment for unclassified and secure communications for all Combat Training Ranges, in addition to studies, analysis, and integration efforts for range command and control, LVC training, and enhanced debrief capabilities. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

LEGACY SYSTEMS: This program procures modifications for multiple obsolete legacy range threat systems (RTS) to extend their serviceable life. Legacy RTS including Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES); Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES); Modular Threat Emitter (MTE); Tactical Range Threat Generator (TRTG); Unmanned Threat Emitter (UMTE); and Band Simulator (Band Sim); and their associated mission support equipment/software. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

COMMON ELECTRONIC ATTACK RECEIVER: This program procures a common electronic attack receiver (CEAR) to replace the obsolete electronic attack receivers (EAR) on Legacy Threat Systems such as the Unmanned Threat Emitter (UMTE), the Joint Threat Emitter (JTE), and the Miniature-Multiple Unmanned Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES).  The CEAR provides real-time and recorded Electronic Warfare feedback to Combat Air Force (CAF) aircrews, improving their survivability in anti-access/area denial combat environments. 

PE 0305116F AERIAL TARGETS

TARGET CONTROL SYSTEMS (TCS): Data Link System Replacement (DLSr): The current Data Link system units in use at Tyndall AFB contain many obsolete parts and are no longer repairable due to lack of replacement parts. Repairs are made today through cannibalization of other units currently in use or intended as backup units, and the population of these units is becoming depleted with less than 3 "full up spares” left. The DLSr will be compatible with legacy targets operation on the Tyndall range. The DLSr will integrate into current Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS) system. The DLSr will be able to be remotely configured to function as a relay, master, or slave to better enable the dynamic weapon system evaluation program (WSEP) environment and incorporate advancements in targets such as the QF-16.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>JOINT THREAT EMITTER (JTE): FY18 funding requested is to procure additional JTE threat emitter units and fixed command and control units and the associated equipment.

            <proc:Description>The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments.
 
Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews. 
 
Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. 

Global ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment. FY15 was the first year of Increment 1 procurement funding to support pre-production activities. The majority of pre-production support activities will be conducted in FY17 and FY18 in advance of the Milestone C decision in 2QFY19.

Global ASNT Inc 2 delivers an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities.  Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems. 

Common Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc 2) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception. CVR Inc 2 will produce a VLF/LF receiver to integrate into current and future airborne and ground based nodes and to improve system performance and reduce supportability costs through commonality. CVR Inc 2 procurement funding is planned to begin in FY20 and has moved from OPAF (3080) to APAF (3010) funding.

            <proc:Description>Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) consists of two advanced sensor systems, the Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) and Scorpion, incorporated into a single WAS System.  Based on existing technological capabilities, WAS will detect/track low, slow and other asymmetrical threats in the airspace and meet the user needs of sensing stressing airborne targets in complex environments with affordable sensors. The sensor outputs will be incorporated into the Battle Control Systems-Fixed (BCS-F) air picture and utilized as the North American Aerospace Defense Command/ Northern Command (NORAD/NORTHCOM) Command and Control (C2) air surveillance system of record.

The WAS strategy is a single step acquisition approach for full capability to develop, produce, and field highly capable and sustainable advanced sensors in the National Capitol Region. In FY18, the WAS program management office plans to award Production and Interim Contractor Support (ICS) Contracts for both STARS and Scorpion systems.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0604445F, Wide Area Surveillance.

In FY17 Wide Area Surveillance was a new start.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>- FY18 funds will procure, produce and field operational Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) and Scorpion sensors, provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for fielded sensors, and procure additional system monitoring capabilities in accordance with North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) Homeland Defense Design.
- FY18 Program Management Administration (PMA) funds will provide management, engineering and technical support for the program office.
- Some key components of each Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) site have long lead time production items. 
- This funding request supports potential Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.</proc:Justification>

DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS Inc 1 is planned as:
Release 1 - Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
Release 2 - AMC with TWCF, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
Release 3 - Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
Release 4 - Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
Release 5 - U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio
Release 6 - Air Force Material Command (AFMC) (Test Bases)

DEAMS Inc 1 is transitioning to the Operation and Support (O&amp;S) phase post Milestone C to support deployed locations.

DEAMS reported MAIS Critical Change in the 31 May 2016 Defense Acquisition Executive Summary (DAES). The program did not meet the original estimate schedule threshold for the Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in August 2015. DEAMS Inc 1 capability will continue to be deployed in FY2016 - FY2020 as approved by the Milestone Decision Authority.

The schedule includes an Oracle R12 upgrade transition to a new production environment and reporting, DCAS, Direct Disbursements, and Audit functionality.

DEAMS Inc 1 funding through FY 2020 is to support the listed deployments. DEAMS Inc 2 will require licenses to support acquisition requirements for AFSPACE and AFMC starting in FY 2022.

Procurement funding for DEAMS is in PE 0901538F, Financial Information Management Systems Development (FMISD).</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Theater Battle Management Core Systems Force Level (TBMCS FL): An integrated battle management system used to plan, execute, and assess an air campaign.  It provides automated planning tools enabling consistent, coordinated battle management at both Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC) and non-AOC entities for operations and intelligence functions.  TBMCS FL is a United States Air Force lead system with joint interest responsible for generation and dissemination of the Air Tasking Order and interoperates with allied units. 

Unit Command and Control (UC2): Provides the wing and base commanders, and their battle staffs with timely and accurate information for effective decision making.  UC2 also provides secure, automated, deployable, and distributed wing-level command and control system with connectivity to TBMCS systems. 

Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2): Provides PRC2 services supporting all Combatant Commands, Joint Services and other government agencies.  Capabilities include web-based access to isolated personnel reports for all Department of Defense (DoD) personnel, C2 tools for performing command and control of recovery efforts for downed airmen/isolated ground troops, and rapid identification of personnel in distress.  PRC2 is used within AOC/Areas Of Responsibility (AOR), Joint Personnel Recovery Centers, and Rescue Coordination Centers to provide the capabilities and services for planning and executing recovery of isolated personnel, and rapidly collaborate, disseminate, and store time-sensitive personnel recovery information.

In FY 2018, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) efforts were transferred from PE 0207410F, Air &amp; Space Operations Center (AOC) to PE 0305984F, Personnel Recovery Command &amp; Ctrl (PRC2), in order to improve visibility on Service's fair share of procurement funding for this joint interest program.

            <proc:Description>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System, is the weapon system that the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for monitoring, planning, executing and assessing theater-wide air and space operations in support of the air battle campaign to meet the Combined/Joint Force Commander's (C/JFC) objectives.  

The AOC WS contains over 40 Command and Control (C2) systems/applications (3rd Party Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)/Government Off the Shelf (GOTS)) that are continually being updated under semi-annual/annual/bi-annual efforts (i.e., Baseline Releases [BR]).  The AOC WS 10.1 integrates these changes as well as provides periodic Capital Equipment Replacement (CER) to keep the AOC WS interoperable, supportable, and compliant (e.g., certification and accreditation).  Fielding will provide Joint C2 interoperability, and respond to the highest priority Combatant Command (CCMD) interoperability problems including: (a) incorporating fixes to shortfalls in interactions with CCMD targeting support systems, (b) enhancing the effectiveness of the operational picture to respond to the proliferation of sensors, and (c) handling data interface changes being experienced with older 3rd Party program deliveries.  Major subsystems have enhanced their security profile and this fielding will serve as a re-accreditation of the overall AOC WS baseline.  This profile provides an excellent transition point for the AOC WS 10.2 modernization baseline.  Primary efforts in fielding include CER and baseline updates via variously sized BRs.  BRs are regularly scheduled 3rd Party COTS/GOTS application updates.  They are normally comprised of hardware/software changes/updates/modernized improvements/modifications and security patches.  Each BR is based on warfighter-validated needs that require updates to the AOC WS 10.1.

The AOC WS funding provides system hardware, software, technical documents, CER (e.g., replacing end-of-life/end of support Direct Mission Support (DMS) and 3rd Party components with solutions that will bridge between 10.1 and 10.2), core radio and initial training to standardize and sustain the AOC WS.  This includes the integration, test and fielding of cyber security improvements and existing 3rd Party modernized improvements/modifications (e.g., replace paper copy with electronic requests).  The fielding and CER consist of AOCs and their associated support sites (e.g., Help Desk, Formal Training Unit (FTU), experimental sites, and Air Reserve Component sites).

There are three distinct categories of AOCs: Geographic, Global (formally known as Functional), and assorted AOC Support Functions (Help Desk, FTU, Operational Support Facility (OSF) and Air Reserve Component sites).  While all sites start with the standardized 10.1 baseline, each is specifically tailored to the needs of the associated Geographic CCMD or Global (formally known as Functional) Command.  Thus, as no two AOCs are alike, when a CER or BR is accomplished, each site is unique and requires its own specifically designed site-engineered fielding plan and associated hardware, which drives differences in site specific (i.e., unit) costs.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Justification>1. FIELDING: Primary efforts include integration and fielding of improvements/upgrades of existing 3rd Party applications as well as newly developed replacement applications, CER (replacing end-of-life/end of support components) and baseline updates via variously sized BRs.

   a. CAPITAL EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT (CER): FY18 funds address numerous commercial end-of-life and DMS components including components associated with C2 applications (3rd Party COTS/GOTS) that must be resolved. 

   b. BASELINE RELEASES (BR): FY18 will fund BRs, periodic maintenance upgrades, emergency fixes, cyber security improvements and other activities (e.g., testing activities). 

   c. FIELDING SYSTEM PROGRAM OFFICE (SPO) SUPPORT: FY18 funds will be used to provide government oversight, technical expertise, and program office support associated with the fielding of AOC. 

   d. TEST SUPPORT (46 Test Squadron [46TS]): FY18 funds will be used to provide government oversight and technical expertise associated with the testing of AOC.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>1).  Due to different levels of complexity, differences in equipment to be updated, and length of required time necessary for modification, the total cost will fluctuate between fiscal years.

2).  Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between mission specific needs and differences in site type i.e., Geographic vs. Global (formally known as Functional) vs. Associated Support Site vs. Air Reserve Component Sites) will drive differences in site specific requirements (e.g., time required, hardware required and software required).  This makes quantification impossible, as there is no single baseline to produce a quantity against.  Per DoD Financial Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 4, Exhibit P-5 Instruction, the quantities in the P-5 are left blank as there is no way to report applicable quantities.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>NOTE: Due to the approved ICE on 7 Oct 16 and AOC 10.2 2016 Critical Change, no Other Procurement, Air Force FY 2018 funding is requested and no funding is required until FY 2019.

NOTE: AOC 10.2 Other Procurement, Air Force FY 2016 early to need funding is being repurposed as Rapid Acquisition Authority for the U.S. Air Force Counter small Unmanned Aerial System (CsUAS) Capabilities, JEON (ST-0008).

The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The AOC WS also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

Relative to AOC 10.1, the AOC 10.2 system is expected to provide faster speed of command, improved cyber security and data integrity, and afford easier and faster integration of 3rd Party capabilities.  The AOC 10.2 funding provides system hardware, software, technical documents, and initial training to field the weapon system 10.2 program baseline.  The fielding efforts focus on, but are not limited to, six Geographic AOCs.  The restructured AOC 10.2 program includes iterative baseline updates to keep pace with evolving Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)/Government Off the Shelf (GOTS)/Capital Equipment Replacement (CER) cyber security needs and will be fielded as the 10.2.0, 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 baselines.

The AOC 10.2 is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  Since the program underwent a MAIS Critical Change in 2016, Milestone C (MS C) is now projected for Jan 2019.  Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) is projected to begin Jan 2019 and continue through April 2019.  Full Deployment Decision (FDD) is projected for Dec 2019.  These efforts are using Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds in PE 0605458F.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207410F.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between mission specific needs and differences in site type) will drive differences in site specific requirements (e.g., time required, hardware required and software required).  The calculated unit costs are representative but not actual and the total cost will fluctuate between fiscal years.

This makes quantification impossible, as there is no single baseline to produce a quantity against.  Per DoD Financial Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 4, Exhibit P-5 Instruction, the quantities in the P-5 are left blank as there is no way to report applicable quantities.

The FY 2017 PB described the Geographic AOC fielding plan with installations of 1/2/3 in FYs 16/17/18.  Due to the AOC 10.2 Critical Change, the new fielding plan calls for installations of 4/4 in FYs 20/21, including iterative installs of 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 at the help desk and FTU.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>BASE INFORMATION TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE (BITI), formerly known as INFORMATION TRANSPORT SYSTEM (ITS): BITI delivers the Air Force cyberspace network and integrated infrastructure for 175 fixed Air Force installations (active duty, reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG)) and Geographically Separated Units (GSU) at approved locations. Integrated BITI will have a consolidated cyber capability addressing emerging cyber threats to infrastructure. BITI capabilities encompass all optical systems, digital voice/data/video systems, commercial devices, unified capabilities and wireless capabilities. The end result of a Turnkey project is a high-speed packet switching and circuit transport of critical information among core buildings and mission areas on a base. Additionally, BITI provides a robust and secure wireless infrastructure that incorporates high-availability and multi-tiered network connections at approved facilities requiring remote access. The efforts in this program budget line through its various increments and major projects, coupled with the efforts from the Air Force Network budget line enable the fielding, support and sustainment of standard, enterprise solutions for the entire Air Force Intranet from the individual base communications closets to the Air Force gateways and all the components and systems in-between in cyberspace. As Unified Capabilities (UC) evolves, BITI will respond with expanded bandwidth to provide the necessary throughput.
In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

BITI will ensure that Air Force operating locations have sufficient infrastructure, bandwidth, and overall network capability to support the current and future communication needs of the Air Force and Joint-Command warfighter via reliable and survivable information transport with sufficient capacity and capability to meet the classified and unclassified data, voice, video, imagery, and telemetry requirements at each installed location. 

BITI Turnkey: Deploys complete BITI system/sub-system infrastructure/equipment for 175 fixed Air Force installations (active duty, reserve, and ANG) and GSU at approved locations. 

BITI Turnkey Modification: Follow on full base internal network modifications for system/sub-system infrastructure. Turnkey Modifications are completed on bases that have already received a Turnkey. As requirements have evolved, base missions have changed and some bases that have already received an earlier Turnkey may not have the fiber needed for the current Base Area Network spec. The Turnkey Modifications expands on the existing outside and inside plant, but not to the extent of an initial Turnkey. The last six (6) Turnkey Modifications started in FY15 and will finish in FY18. After completion of these last Turnkey Modifications, all BITI base work will be Recapitalizations. 

BITI Recapitalization: Replaces critical "backbone" infrastructure of network equipment installed as part of Turnkeys on a routine basis for fielded systems for over 175 fixed Air Force installations (active duty, reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG)) and Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) at approved locations. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the armed forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303112F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>BITI:  FY18 funding includes, but is not limited to, implementation and upgrades to broadband, fiber-optic digital information transport networks to provide mission-critical information transfer capabilities at fixed Air Force bases (Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard) and selected geographically separated unit locations.  Procurement efforts include, but are not limited, site surveys, installations, and interim contractor support (ICS).

BITI Turnkey Modification:  FY18 deliveries will modify the complete system infrastructure/equipment on bases that have already received a Turnkey.  The last six (6) installations started taking place in FY15 and will finish in FY18.

BITI Recapitalization:  FY18 replaces BITI Turnkey fielded systems for 175 fixed Air Force installations.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>Unit cost has significant variability due to size and complexity of bases/projects. A quantity is defined as a base location site survey or install and is projected based on mission requirements and funding availability.

Manpower (consisting of DMS &amp; PSC) is combined Operations &amp; Support and Acquisition cost.
PROGRAM SUPPORT COSTS (PSC) formally known as PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA): PSC BITI program supports the operation of the program office in its management and oversight role. PSC supports the BITI and the Base Information Infrastructure (BII) Program with engineering and technical support, as well as, support activities for the program.  

DIRECT MISSION SUPPORT (DMS): DMS for BITI includes all support associated with equipment installation, engineering technical orders, sustainment engineering, and implementation. This includes the initial bed down and operability testing, technical interchange meetings, interim contractor support and events associated with fielding both hardware and software products, and maintaining configuration control of fielded products.

Funding for Turnkey projects end in 2015, all other funding line items continue through 2027. 2016 and beyond are solely recapitalizations.  

NOTE: Previous modification efforts (FY16 &amp; FY17) were reported on the P-5 exhibit.  Direction in January 2016 was to begin reporting the modification effort for BITI on a P-3a exhibit starting for the FY18 effort and beyond.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Description>BITI Turnkey Modification: FY18 deliveries will modify the complete system infrastructure/equipment on bases that have already received a Turnkey.  Modernizations are responding to COTS obsolescence, address changes in bandwidth requirements, and re-scaling of the Base Area Network backbone equipment to support the base until the next mod/recap (5 year cycle).  The last 6 installations started taking place in FY15 and will finish in FY18.

BITI Recapitalization: FY18 replaces BITI Turnkey fielded systems for 175 fixed Air Force installations.

NOTE: Previous modification efforts (FY16 &amp; FY17) were reported on the P-5 exhibit.  Direction in January 2016 was to begin reporting the modification effort for BITI on a P-3a exhibit starting for the FY18 effort and beyond.

            <proc:Description>AFNet Weapon Systems in this exhibit are defined as follows: (1) Air Force Cyberspace Defense (ACD),(2) Cyberspace Security and Control System (CSCS), and (3) Air Force Intranet Control (AFINC). Funding for the ACD weapon system are allocated in PE 0207425F &amp; 0208088F. Funding for CSCS &amp; AFINC weapon systems are allocated in PE 0303089F. 

AFNet provides Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to implement, deliver and upgrade installation processing nodes and boundaries, AF Gateways, Information Management Suite, enterprise network security, network situational awareness and C2 capabilities, and allows for the interface with and assured movement of information from terrestrial, air and space-based networks, thus enabling Air Force Information Operations (AFINOps). All funds used for AFNet Systems support the continued establishment and transformation of the AFINOps construct toward the standards and specifications of the DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE). The procurement efforts in this program budget line includes, but are not limited to, equipment purchase, engineering/integration, certification and accreditation, deployment, testing, training equipment/systems, associated training and interim contractor support. Procurements implement technology and capabilities within the AFNet in accordance with the DoD IT Roadmap, AF Information Dominance Flight Plan, AF Cyber blueprint and the AF Network Action Plan. All activities may incorporate support to other program elements across the Air Force Information Enterprise in accordance with SAF/A6 CIO direction, the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE) strategy.

PE 0207425F, AFNET OPS AND COMMAND COMM

This PE was an FY16 single year PE placeholder specifically set up to execute AFNet requirements until transition to Weapon System PEs 0208088F &amp; 0303089F in FY17.

PE 0208088F, AIR FORCE CYBERSPACE DEFENSE (ACD) WEAPON SYSTEM

Procures and installs active defensive counter cyberspace operations and situational awareness capabilities in a Defensive Cyberspace Operations role to achieve cyberspace superiority for assigned missions. ACD procurements allow for 24/7/365 monitoring and defense of US Air Force and US Central Command, and Third Party SIPR/NIPR computer networks against hostile attacks as well as intrusion detection, network traffic analysis, network forensics analysis, countermeasure development and execution, and incident response. ACD provides indication and warning, correlation, logging, vulnerability remediation, assessment, process management, blocking, vulnerability identification, investigation and containment. In addition, the ACD provides CSSP (Cyber Security Service Provider) service system upgrades to the AFNet and several third party entities including Joint Strike Fighter, USTRANSCOM, and others. Efforts include, but are not limited to: Host Based Security System upgrades, Next Generation Firewall and Full Packet Capture and Data Analytics Enterprise.

PE 0301400F, SPACE SUPERIORITY INTELLIGENCE (SSI)

This PE executes requirements for SSI. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

No FY18 funds are requested.

Cyber Situational Awareness Weapon System (CSAWS): Procures and installs equipment to connect 24th AF unfiltered traffic flow to 25th AF for PAD (Processing, Analysis and Distribution) enabling the first AF Cyber ISR collection and processing capability. Provides ISR based adversary cyber activity Indications and Warnings (I&amp;W) for Situational Awareness (SA). The effort procures a dedicated AF Cyber ISR platform (Remote Data Collector and Remote Data Processor) array that connects to the highest level at the network gateway locations to obtain unfiltered net-flow and packet capture (PCAP). This data is moved via long-haul to the 25th AF El Dorado PAD systems for analysis. The fusion of all source intelligence and net flow analysis provides actionable CTA (Cyber Threat Advisories) reports to cyber operators for the appropriate and proactive actions.

PE 0303089F, AIR FORCE INTRANET CONTROL / CYBERSPACE SECURITY AND CONTROL SYSTEM (AFINC/CSCS) WEAPON SYSTEM

This PE executes requirements for both AFINC and CSCS weapon systems. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

(1) AFINC: Procures and installs equipment for network operations, network defense and overall management of the AF NIPRNet Gateways and the Information Management Suite as well as the Air Force discrete requirements associated with the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). Efforts include, but are not limited to:
AFNet NIPR Gateways (MAC-1 system) and SIPR Gateways (GW), which deliver critical network defense capabilities for the AF enterprise with over 800k users directly supporting flying, maintenance, space and cyber operations across the full range of military operations. GWs prevent and detect unauthorized network infiltration attempts, automatically initiating network defense countermeasures eliminating adversary ability to gain access to the enterprise which would diminish the AF information defense posture. GWs directly support cyber operations worldwide enabling war-fighting missions.  With the migration of all Air Force installations to JRSS the GWs will sunset. Funding enables the removal of systems dependent on the GWs and subsequent decommissioning of the GWS. Includes recapitalization of the Information Management Suite (IMS), which provides the Air force with a secure, real-time centralized Out of Band Management of the network management infrastructure for the AFINC, ACD, and CSCS Weapon systems and unifies the management/defense of AF networks and assets, as well as procures equipment upgrades that directly relate to the migration of AF traffic and technology transition from the AFNet NIPR Gateways to the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). 

(2) CSCS: Procures and installs capabilities contributing to cyber mission assurance, including proactive defense and persistent network operations for the Air Force and the Air Force-provisioned portions of the DoD Information Network (DoDIN) and the Air Force Information Network (AFIN). CSCS modifications support the following activities: fault resolution activities to maintain operational capabilities; lead-in coordinating activities at base-level Network Control Centers for necessary network security actions; monitoring of AF network services; managing of boundary protection devices and the Air Force network infrastructure; and continuous network situational awareness. Efforts include, but are not limited to: Data Center Consolidation and migration to the Joint Information Environment (JIE); upgrade to the Core Services and the Air Force Vulnerability Management (AFVM) and Network Management.

FY18 will procure upgrades for CSCS and AFINC based on 1067 requests.  CSCS includes, but is not limited to, Vulnerability Management, Area Processing Center and Regional Data Center Consolidations, and Installation Processing Nodes ACAS upgrades.  AFINC includes, but is not limited to, Gateway e-mail security/DNS upgrades.

PE 0303112F, AFNET (Formally titled: AIR FORCE COMMUNICATION (AIRCOM))

In FY17, funding in this PE was reallocated to the CSCS, ACD, and AFINC weapon system PEs to fund their block mods, as part of the transition of AFNet to the three weapon systems.

PE 0303228F, AFNET/JOINT INFORMATON ENVIROMENT (JIE)

This PE executes requirements for JIE. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements. 

DoD leadership has established and is tracking JIE (Joint Information Environment) implementation tasks that inclemently address diverse key categories that include but are not limited to: Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), Network Consolidation, Security, Enterprise Services, Application Rationalization, Enterprise Licensing, Mobility Service, Cloud Computing, and Installation types (e.g., Core Data Centers, Enterprise Operations Centers, etc.). Much of the Increment 1 effort focuses on delivering and implementing reference and solution architectures and artifacts, developing TTPs needed to operate JIE capabilities (with global instantiation), defining and establishing an initial set of enterprise services, and establishing the governance processes critical to JIE management. Similar implementation tasks will be established for PACOM and CONUS during Increments 2 and 3 respectively. JIE funding may be used to maintain the current architecture of the AFNET while JIE implementation is ongoing.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PEs 0204725F, 0208088F, 0301400F, 0303089F, 0303112F, 0303228F.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>PE 0303089F executes requirements for both Cyberspace Security and Control System (CSCS) and Air Force Intranet Control (AFINC) weapon systems. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

(1) AFINC: Procures and installs equipment for network operations, network defense and overall management of the AF NIPRNet Gateways and the Information Management Suite as well as the Air Force discrete requirements associated with the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). Efforts include, but are not limited to:
AFNet NIPR Gateways (MAC-1 system) and SIPR Gateways (GW), which deliver critical network defense capabilities for the AF enterprise with over 800k users directly supporting flying, maintenance, space and cyber operations across the full range of military operations. GWs prevent and detect unauthorized network infiltration attempts, automatically initiating network defense countermeasures eliminating adversary ability to gain access to the enterprise which would diminish the AF information defense posture. GWs directly support cyber operations worldwide enabling war-fighting missions.  With the migration of all Air Force installations to JRSS the GWs will sunset. Funding enables the removal of systems dependent on the GWs and subsequent decommissioning of the GWS.  Includes recapitalization of the Integrated Management Suite, which provides for real-time centralized Out of band Management of network devices, and unifies the management/defense of AF networks and assets, as well as procures equipment upgrades that directly relate to the migration of AF traffic and technology transition from the AFNet NIPR Gateways to the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS).

(2) CSCS: Procures and installs capabilities contributing to cyber mission assurance, including proactive defense and persistent network operations for the Air Force and the Air Force-provisioned portions of the DoD Information Network (DoDIN) and the Air Force Information Network (AFIN). CSCS modifications support the following activities: fault resolution activities to maintain operational capabilities; lead-in coordinating activities at base-level Network Control Centers for necessary network security actions; monitoring of AF network services; managing of boundary protection devices and the Air Force network infrastructure; and continuous network situational awareness. Efforts include, but are not limited to: 
Data Center Consolidation and migration to the Joint Information Environment (JIE); upgrades to Core Services and Air Force Vulnerability Management (AFVM) and Network Management.

FY18 will procure upgrades for CSCS and AFINC based on 1067 requests. CSCS includes, but is not limited to Vulnerability Management, Area Processing Center and Regional Data Center Consolidations, and Installation Processing Nodes ACAS upgrades.  AFINC includes, but is not limited to, Gateway e-mail security/DNS upgrades.

            <proc:Description>JOINT COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT ELEMENT (JCSE): JCSE, assigned under Joint Enabling Capabilities Command, US Transportation Command, is the only joint Department of Defense (DoD) unit specifically formed to provide command, control, communications, and computers (C4) systems support for Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) contingency operations worldwide. The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) mission is to provide, on short notice, those critical communications required to support Joint Task Force support (JTF) and Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) headquarters. These assets support the warfighter's ability to deploy rapidly and immediately provide the positive command and control required. This support includes contingency and crisis communications for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commands, Services, Defense agencies, non-Defense agencies, and foreign governments. Program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with the maximum capabilities, smallest footprint, lowest operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. Per Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and Director, Joint Staff Memorandum (DJSM)0291-14, the Air Force is mandated to fund 1/3rd fair share of JCSE's validated Modernization Program.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207422F, Deployable Command, Control, and Communications (C3) Systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>JCSE: FY2018 base funding procures communications equipment based on Strategic Planning Guidance.  This includes the maximum capabilities for narrowband, wideband and  protected satellite communications (SATCOM) terminals and systems, tactical radios, terrestrial communications systems, satellite hubs, networking elements, virtual appliances, Video Teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities, alternative power solutions, Airborne /En-Route, Forced Entry, Cyber Security, and Mobile Joint C2 equipment. Advancements in technology have provided opportunities to modernize current equipment sets with enhanced capabilities to meet the program goals which include meeting emerging real-world operational and cyber defense requirements with maximum capabilities, the smallest possible footprint, lowest operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. This equipment is a critical part of Command, Control and Communications packages that provide direct operational support to joint forces and HQ elements deployed to austere locations around the globe. Per the Planning Guidance, the Air Force is mandated to fund one-third of the fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan. JCSE's Program is built/restructured based on Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service Components' requirements and emerging technologies. The Services influence JCSE's spending plan through recommendations in concert with Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements.</proc:Justification>

HQ USCENTCOM's mission is to work with its national and international partners in promoting development and cooperation among nations, responding to crises, and deterring or defeating state and transnational aggression in order to establish regional security and stability across its entire Area of Responsibility (AOR). Since USCENTCOM's AOR, covering the Middle East, includes the challenges of regional stability and violent extremists, this Combatant Command's mission is critical in regards to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). To meet its mission responsibilities across this geographical expanse, HQ USCENTCOM must rely heavily on Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) systems capable of achieving full spectrum information superiority. 

Funding for this effort is contained in PE 0201122F USCENTCOM Communications.

USCENTCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: Effort will provide end of life replacement for, but not limited to, Command and Control (C2) systems (thin client, server, etc), Joint Information Environment (JIE), classified and unclassified voice, data and video dissemination, storage area network (SAN) infrastructure, establishment of the CENTCOM Partner Network (CPN) which provides a new secure network for bilateral / multilateral information sharing up to the SECRET RELEASABLE level. Support maximum data storage capacity requirements for HQ war records collection, Modeling &amp; Simulation Systems (J8MS), and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) required for the command's collateral classified and unclassified data networks. This equipment provides HQ USCENTCOM with effective C4 systems to effectively conduct current and future operations throughout the AOR.

            <proc:Description>Tactical Airborne Control Systems PE 0207418F - P-5
PE 0207418F TACTICAL AIRBORNE CONTROL SYSTEM EQUIPMENT 

Tactical airborne control system equipment encompass three types of simulators that provide scenario based training for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs), Combat Control Teams (CCTs), Tactical Air Control Party (TACPs), Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) and various Close Air Support (CAS) Platforms. 

Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS): TACP Fixed and Portable Simulators comprise JTC TRS.  This simulator project trains personnel controlling air support for combat operations by providing both a stand-alone and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)-capable high-fidelity JTAC, and Combat Control Team (CCT) simulation system.  The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms, JTACs and CCTs to train together in a risk-free environment. The Fixed simulator enables operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the simulator will be capable of providing tactical air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations.  The JTAC simulators provide DMO capability to network with aircrew full mission trainers, mission training centers, and Air Support Operations Centers (ASOC).   Its primary focus is to provide an air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC and CCT skills and train aircrew to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to friendly ground forces. JTAC simulators will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards.  Training with simulators has the potential to reduce civilian casualties, collateral damage and fratricide by improving coordination skills between air and ground personnel, and increasing JTAC and aircrew proficiency.  The acquisition strategy for production of the fixed configuration of the JTC TRS will be executed as an evolutionary acquisition approach using incremental development. Until the production system is ready for fielding, interim simulators will be fielded to support JTAC qualification training and readiness for deployable JTACs.  DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JTC TRS weapon system capability.

  

TACP C2 Simulator:  The Joint Theater Air-Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) is the TACP C2 Simulator.  The simulator is for training ASOC and Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel to perform command and control (C2) battlestaff operations.  The C2 simulator will operate in either a stand-alone mode, or connected to other DMO-capable high-fidelity simulation facilities to allow geographically-separated Theater Air Control System C2 elements, CAS platforms, and JTAC and CCT personnel to train in an integrated virtual environment.  The simulator will enable operators to conduct C2 training and mission rehearsal of JCAS assets using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to current real-world mission taskings.  Scenarios will cover the full range of military operations.  Training with the simulator will improve mission effectiveness by reducing the risk of civilian casualties, collateral damage, and fratricide by improving C2 skills in rapidly changing and uncertain combat environments.  The JTAGSS program will enable procurement of an estimated three JTAGSS for air support operations training. The acquisition strategy for the TACP C2 simulator will be to field advance technology demonstration units in two increments.  Increment 1 will field initial capability to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete simulator development, deployment and integration.

Security Forces (SF)Tactical Communication Radios - 0207588F - P40A
FY17 funds are required to replace, reconstitute, and update critical communication equipment that's forward deployed from stateside bases and AFCENT to support missions within the AOR.  Transformation to a wideband networking radio is required to communicate with joint and coalition forces.  Additionally, SATCOM reach-back is inherent to SF operations. Funding is also required to ensure radios are compatible with SATCOM waveforms like Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) and the new Navy-led Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which legacy radios are not compatible with wideband networking, BGAN, or MUOS.

Deployable C3 Systems PE 0207422F - P-40A
PE 0207422F DEPLOYABLE COMMAND, CONTROL, and COMMUNICATIONS (C3) SYSTEMS

THEATER-DEPLOYABLE COMMUNICATIONS (TDC) PROGRAM: TDC is used to extend network data, voice and video services to expeditionary and battlefield forces. The TDC system provides stand-alone communications support for the full range of military operations and communications capability for Command and Control (C2) reach back at and above the tactical level for a variety of Air Force missions. TDC provides a rapidly deployable communication infrastructure package, which provides deployed users with secure and non-secure voice service, internet access, local area network, network management, information assurance, e-mail services (NIPR/SIPRNET), and intra/inter-base connectivity services similar to those established on a fixed base. The TDC package uses commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to support a wide scope of expeditionary missions ranging from a small C2 and airfield mission, supporting 1 to 150 users, and up to the stand-up of an Air Expeditionary Wing supporting 3,000 users. The TDC package also supports Special Missions, to include noncombatant evacuation and disaster relief efforts, US Secret Service support, and Homeland Defense Operations. TDC as directed in Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Program Action Directive (PAD) 12-07, and as identified from the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) directed RAND Study is employed to provide and support 22 Large Communications Package missions at Combat Communications squadrons, 27 Medium Communications Package missions at Combat Communications and Global Mobility Readiness squadrons and 55 Small Communications Package missions at Air Mobility Command units and Air Control squadrons. 

The TDC program reached full operational capability in 2008 and is currently providing sustainment and procuring and installing end of life/end of support and new requirement efforts to maintain full operational capability. Replacement efforts focus on addressing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues associated with COTS components. Funding of the TDC program will procure hardware and software targeted to alleviate interoperability and software issues that arise from the constant evolution of technology. Controlled items will be funded with investment funds to purchase military communications equipment classified as critical protection items. Funding will also ensure TDC equipment maintains compliance with security mandates/directives and cryptographic standards. The program has three components: 

a. HUB AND SPOKE SATELLITE TERMINALS: Satellite terminals provide two-way communications connectivity between expeditionary bases and reach back, through Defense Information System Agency (DISA) teleports, to the global information grid. These terminals augment limited DOD X-Band (Super High Frequency) resources by providing access to commercial satellite services. By augmenting the X- Band terminals, TDC's Spoke Satellite terminals transparently improve the expeditionary workforce's bandwidth throughput for high-speed voice, data, video, and imagery transmissions. Small aperture SATCOM terminals supporting direct internet protocol connection capable of supporting multi-commercial and military transmission bands significantly reduce airlift requirements and provide flexibility during expeditionary operations. 

b. INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS PACKAGE (ICAP): ICAP provides the distributed base backbone which includes: hubs/routers, switches, multiplexers, secure/non-secure telephones, secure conferencing, cryptographic and timing equipment, and intra-base connectivity using fiber and/or point-to-point radios. ICAP packages include accessories and configuration kits to tailor the capability of voice and data modules (i.e. cards to interface to the host nation postal telegraph and telephone). ICAP packages are modular which allows assets to be deployed incrementally and provides the capability to expand the network as the base population increases.

c. NETWORK CONTROL CENTER-DEPLOYED (NCC-D): NCC-D provides deployed network management, information protection, and network planning capabilities similar to those at fixed bases. Specific functions include data management, intrusion detection, and firewall capabilities for both the classified and unclassified networks. 

Changes in cost are due to the quantity of equipment, number of users they support, and the configurations of the three components.  Size of packages vary from year to year.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Advanced Communications Systems PE 0207423F - P-5
PE 0207423F  JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEMS/JTRS

The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is a family of software programmable tactical radios that provide voice, data, and video communications for military users in the air, on the ground, and at sea. Common radio architecture and programmable software waveforms will provide joint interoperability between the services. The JTRS program is built around an open system software communications architecture (SCA), a critical set of rules that make software programmable radios function properly and ensure interoperability.  Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207423F.

Tactical Air Control Party-Mod PE 0207444F - P-5
TACTICAL AIR CONTROL PARTY-MODERNIZATION (TACP-M): TACPs are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. 

The purpose of the TACP-Modernization program is to provide TACP voice, data and video communications, targeting and battlefield awareness capabilities. These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Centers (ASOCs), Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce close air support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications. 

TACPs also coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from tactical operations centers (TOCs), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols. 

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in the following major areas: (1) Tactical Operations Center (TOC) Systems (used in fixed operations centers), (2) Vehicle Mounted Systems (used in TACP tactical vehicles), (3) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (4) Close Air Support System (CASS) software. The TACP-M program also works closely with the Battlefield Airmen Office program to procure dismounted JTAC equipment. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities.  Frequent TACP combat deployments sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

BATTLEFIELD AIRMEN OPERATIONS KIT (BAO Kit): BAO Kit will deliver a System of Systems (SoS) that provides a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and also provides a suite of systems for all Air Force Specialty Codes supporting the Special Tactics (ST) community within the Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. This program will procure and enhance technologies for battlefield airmen ST operators that are inter-operable with US and coalition special operations dismounted forces. BAO Kit allows the ability to recognize, identify, range, nominate and designate targets during both day and night. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, fix, track, target and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre- and post-strike, and transmitting target data to command and control centers. All BAO Kit systems are light, compact and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. Modernization efforts focus on reducing the weight of the equipment carried by the dismounted operator. The core capabilities include but are not restricted to: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Operational Control System (OCS), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting device, Non Line of Sight (XLOS) targeting device, and Machine to Machine C4ISR System. BAO also supports AFSOC TAC C2 program purchases enhanced communication systems and equipment essential for ST combat controllers, pararescue, combat weather operators, and tactical air control parties to perform their mission and communicate beyond line of site (BLOS) with rear echelon C2, in order to provide a joint operating picture. The ST operators use this equipment to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield/assault landing/drop zone operations. Moreover, items include but not limited to training, initial spares, repairs and returns, and other equipment.

BATTLEFIELD AIRMEN OPERATIONS (BAO) Kit: FY18 funding will procure, test, support, and repair BAO Kit system of system components to optimize user information intake.  Funding will be used to ensure interoperability to reduce the risk of fratricide, reduce the weight carried by individual Airmen, and reduce the time required to find, fix, track, target, and engage the enemy. The core capabilities included are but not restricted to: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Operational Control System (OCS), Line-of-Sight (LOS) targeting device, Non-Line of-Sight (XLOS) targeting device, and Machine-to-Machine C4ISR system. Also, BAO Kit items to include but not limited to individual training, initial spares, equipment repairs, and other logistical service.

a. HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE (HMI): FY18 funding will procure HMI components that will provide integrated operator interface between all the machine components by using unified visual and auditory displays and controls, such as head-mounted displays and tactical earplug connectivity with communications. This system provides optimized user information portrayal and control of peripheral devices, to include modernization of communications, computing devices, portable electrical power generation and management, targeting and situational awareness software (machine to machine) designed to reduce risk of fratricide and reduce the time required to employ precision effects on the battlefield to single-digit minutes.

b. OPERATIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM (BAO KIT): FY18 funding will procure OCS.  OCS is an integrated communication/display system comprised of a small wearable end user device, power and data management system, including integrated cabling and wireless data transmission that can readily connect and integrate all Battlefield Airmen Operations (BAO) Kit peripherals and portable power sources. The OCS system is a light weight, modular, plate carrier adaptable, integrated, easily configurable system that provides precise situational awareness, moving maps, and the ability to perform digitally-aided CAS targeting for all Battlefield Airmen and Special Operations Forces. The OCS is consumable with a lifespan of two years. OCS is upgraded every two years providing more durable hardware, reduced size and weight, and additional capability to the operator. 

c. LINE OF SIGHT (LOS): FY18 funding will procure LOS systems. LOS integrates target designators and sensors to enhance targeting effectiveness at ranges less than 3km. The equipment provides battlefield airmen with the ability to geo-locate targets in both eye-safe and non-eye safe spectrums. The modernization of this equipment will significantly reduce the weight carried by the operator. Funding will also support AFSOC TAC C2 program purchases of XLOS targeting devices that are essential for combat weather operators. Such equipment will allow operators to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield/assault landing drop zone operations. 

Items requested in FY18 as identified on the P-5 Exhibit are representative of items to be procured. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements.

            <proc:Description>This program procures and fields Scope Command High Frequency (HF) radio equipment, network infrastructure, and transmit/receive antennas for 13 strategically located ground stations worldwide. All hardware and software, including radios and antennas, is commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) with the exception of the software that provides the military functionality required for the COTS equipment to operate as a HF radio system. This software is a COTS-based product that has been configured for the DoD to provide the unique capabilities required. The need for modern, robust, and dependable stations with beyond line of sight radio coverage has been identified to ensure HF radio communications is available in additional areas of interest to the United States.

High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) is the only global, strategic high-power HF Command and Control (C2) network serving the Department of Defense (DoD). HFGCS consists of the two major components: the radio/ network infrastructure (Scope Command) and the antennas (Antenna Program Support) which communicate with mobile assets (aircraft, Navy ships, Coast Guard ships). HFGCS supports aircrews, ground forces, naval operations, and control stations and is the primary C2 resource for Air Mobility Command cargo and tanker aircraft. Additional customers include White House Communications Agency (WHCA), Defense Communications System HF Entry, US Navy High Command Network, and other US government agencies. HFGCS supports war plan dissemination and daily operational requirements for WHCA, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), US Strategic Command, National Military Command Center's Emergency Action Message distribution, Special Air Mission communications, Nuclear Command, Control &amp; Communications (NC3), Major Air Force Commands and Combatant Commanders. HFGCS provides radio connectivity to other governmental organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, and the State Department. The HFGCS network supports Overseas Contingency Operations by providing secure, robust, physically diverse terrestrial and airborne transmission paths providing information services between fixed and deployed operating locations. HFGCS has also been identified as a key communications component in supporting operations in an anti-access area-denial (A2AD) environment.

The HFGCS program recently updated system consoles to replace end-of-life components and to provide increased system security and operations capabilities. The program also installed additional radios at HFGCS stations to consolidate with US Navy operations, allowing the Navy to close obsolete HF stations. FY18 funds Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) external interfaces to replace the obsolete switches and communications infrastructure supporting C2 operations, Direct Mission Support/Program Management Administration (DMS/PMA), System Engineering, Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC) Installation Testing and shipping costs for these procurement efforts.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303133F.

Military Necessity:  Controlled Item will be funded with investment funds to purchase military communications equipment classified as critical protection items.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>1. SCOPE COMMAND RADIO/NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE: The Scope Command Radio/Network Infrastructure requires continuous sustainment to replace technically obsolete and logistically unsupportable equipment to maintain existing capability. These projects continue the implementation of updated COTS radio and console capabilities into the HFGCS network. The current projects update the system efficiencies within radio operations and mission control, as well as maintain interoperability and compatibility with the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the Defense Information System Network (DISN). The HFGCS FY18 program supports three main projects within the Scope Command Radio/Network Infrastructure Program and continues the Antenna Replacement program. The FY18 HFGCS Network Infrastructure program includes the Audio Communications Functionality (ACF) Phase II, Hekimian Systems Test Equipment Replacement and the Receive Matrix Replacement.

A. The ACF program provides updated audio functionality at an individual HFGCS radio station by replacing the obsolete Digital Electronic Switch (DES), as neither the DES nor Liberty Star-3 (LS-3) switch is on the Approved Product List. The use of these switches also limits the ability to maintain information assurance certification for HFGCS. Removing the IDPX-1000 DES and LS-3 from the HFGCS and replacing them with Open Architecture, non-proprietary, commercially available, modular components ensures the circuit interfaces are compatible with DISA architecture evolution as identified in the DISN Technical Evolution Plan and the DISN Overarching Technical Strategy 2011. This follows the effort in FY17 which demonstrates the Network Control Station capability. Installation of the final ACF capability will be in FY20-21. This continues the transition of the HFGCS network from an analog based to internet protocol (IP) based network.

B. FY18 funding purchases replacement system test equipment for installation in the 13 stations and will update the existing Control and Management System (CCMS) software to control the replacement equipment. The existing Hekimian System Test Equipment is obsolete and no longer supportable by the manufacturer. The test equipment is critical to maintaining operational capability of the radio and antenna equipment for efficient operation. 

C. FY18 funding purchases 15 new Receive Matrices and installs them at the 13 stations, with one installation at the Systems Integration Lab and 1 spare. The funding will also update existing CCMS software to control the new Receive Matrix. The existing receive matrices have become obsolete and there are no longer spare parts manufactured to maintain the capability to interface between the radios and antennas.

D. Next Generation Console/Unified Capabilities: No Budget Year (FY18) funding requested..

2. HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL ANTENNA REPLACEMENT: A majority of the HFGCS system antennas have been in operation for 25 to 40 years and have been subjected to degradation due to exposure to severe environmental conditions, salt water, and hurricane force winds. FY18 funds continue the replacement of critical antennas at HFGCS sites; actual locations and antenna selections will be based on technical assessment of the antenna condition and the operational requirements of the weapon system during execution. Planned replacements for FY18 have been identified at Ascension, Croughton, and Offutt. Additionally mandatory surveys will be conducted to prepare for future antenna installations at Lajes, West Coast, Puerto Rico, Sigonella, Elmendorf, Yokota, and Hawaii scheduled for follow-on efforts. 

3. FY18 funds for program management administration costs will provide financial management, engineering and technical support for the program office. FY18 also funds Direct Mission Support, including support associated with equipment installation, engineering, technical orders, sustainment engineering, shipping, and implementation. This includes interoperability testing and technical interchange meetings.</proc:Justification>

Visual Information Activities - Strategic PE 0102890F - P-40A
Imagery Acquisition and Audiovisual (AV) systems and their products are used throughout the Air Force to inform and train warfighters and to document combat operations and other events of historical significance. Combat video documentation is used for operational reporting and analysis, situational awareness, battle damage assessment, intelligence and operational analysis, casualty identification, and the historical record. In addition, video and multimedia based products are developed for warfighter operations, readiness training, medical videography, public and internal information, testing and evaluation, and corporate communications. Commanders recognize that imagery quickly conveys very accurate and unbiased information, and are requiring greater amounts of video imagery to help meet the challenges of a very active warfighting force. The Air Force is meeting this challenge by dedicating funding to procure and sustain this important capability by replacing older video studio systems with newer and more capable equipment and systems for both Air Force video production and combat/contingency documentation teams. Imagery acquisition systems are centrally managed to establish and maintain standardization of systems, as well as to ensure full interoperability with all other electronic image acquisition, transmission system formats, and presentation systems used in the Air Force.</proc:Description>

FY18 Funds procure items to meet AF mandates from CJCSI 3205.01C, DODI 5040.02, and AFI 35-109. These policy documents exist to ensure DoD and AF compliance with public laws: 36 CFR 1237/1220 and Title 44 Chapters 3301/3101. These funds are used for audio/visual equipment funding at the only three AF active duty COMCAM squadrons, which provide lobal/deployable rapid response during wartime operations, worldwide crises, contingencies, joint exercises, and humanitarian operations. Additionally, these funds procure audio/visual equipment supporting AF-wide(garrison and deployed) needs for photo, graphics and video products that aid public diplomacy, internal/external communication, information operations, operational/planning efforts, and effective/efficient training.</proc:Justification>

Shared Early Warning (SEW) PE 0308699F
The Shared Early Warning System (SEWS) - SEWS provides accurate and timely ballistic missile warning information generated by space-based infrared sensors. This information is distributed to three Combatant Commands (USEUCOM, USCENTCOM, USPACOM), NATO, and multiple foreign partner nations located within each of the serviced COCOMs. U.S. forces and foreign partner nations receive missile warning data via a dedicated communications network flowing from the Centralized Distribution Facility (CDF) at Peterson AFB, CO to secondary distribution facilities located with the COCOMs and distribution hubs located in foreign partner nation operations centers.  Data segregation for the foreign nation partners is maintained through the use of approved cross domain solutions with unique rule sets that reflect Office of the Secretary of Defense policy regarding the dissemination of missile warning data to foreign nations.  SEWS received funding to support incremental technical upgrades to replace outdated components and accommodate newer software products. 

PAVE PAWS Block 00 Update
This effort was formerly called BPP Block 00 Update and was formerly funded in PE 0305912F. Starting FY18 it will be funded in PE 1203912F. The PAVE PHASED ARRAY WARNING SYSTEM (PAVE PAWS) is a ground based system with missions to support the Missile Correlation, Space Surveillance and Missile Defense Centers. These radars are located at Beale AFB, CA and Cod AFS, MA. The primary mission is to provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) penetrating the coverage area and predicted impact (L&amp;PI) data for attack assessment and response determination. The secondary mission is to provide credible data on all Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. The tertiary mission is to support the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) network providing near-earth satellite surveillance and tracking, reporting observational (metric), SOI on man-made satellites and maintenance of the space catalog to prevent the significantly increasing potential for collisions with national assets, including manned space platforms. The PAVE PAWS mission equipment and associated sustainment suites consist of a mix of unique, custom-built components that are increasingly more difficult to maintain due to availability of replacement parts and obsolete COTS based subsystems that are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturers. In addition, radar transmit &amp; receive components, processing equipment, and power distribution elements, and other radar front-end equipment are 30+ years old, highly inefficient, and require replacement. Without these replacements there is a high risk that equipment failures will cause unacceptable mission downtime in order to troubleshoot and repair.

BMEWS Block 00 Update
This effort was formally called BPP Block 00 Update and was formerly funded in PE 0305909F. Starting FY18 it will be funded in PE 1203909F.  The Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) is a ground-based radar system whose primary mission of missile warning (MW) provides United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. This data includes an estimation of launch and predicted impact (L&amp;PI) locations and times. Additionally, BMEWS provides USSTRATCOM and other users with ITW/AA data on Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) penetrating the coverage area. The Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) sites at Thule and Fylingdales have a co-primary mission of Missile Defense (MD) supporting the Missile Defense Agency (Clear scheduled for UEWR upgrade in 2016). The secondary mission of BMEWS supports the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) mission by providing near-earth satellite surveillance, tracking and identification as required by the Joint Space Operations Center, Alternate Space Operations Center, and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center. The BMEWS consists of: Thule Air Base, Greenland; Clear Air Force Station, AK; and Royal Air Force (RAF) Fylingdales, UK. Additionally there is a fourth site for testing (System Program Agency) located in the Centralized Integration Support Facility (CISF) at Peterson AFB, CO.

                    <proc:Description>The Gen 4 equipment is being procured as a centrally managed commodity procurement as part of the National Airspace System (NAS) system.  NAS system configuration is centrally maintained and certified by the Federal Aviation Administration which has system engineering responsibility for the NAS.  The National Airspace System (NAS) Gen 4 Modification continues mitigation of diminishing manufacturing source issues for the NAS program which has transitioned to the Operational Support Phase.  Over its 15 year production/implementation phase, NAS was fielded in multiple hardware configurations and software builds.  Current NAS processors and associated network equipment have gone end of life.  The NAS Gen4 modification establishes standard hardware and software configurations and ensures continued system supportability and availability.  Configuration consolidation also reduces multiple, simultaneous efforts associated with system software development and test while reducing cost outlays. 

JUSTIFICATION:
 
FY18 funds will procure 4 upgrade kits (4 AD/0 ANG/0 AFR).

Milestone/Development Status

Modification kits have already been kit proofed by FAA and are available off FAA contract.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>FY16 funding includes $3.580M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations (Guardian Angel Fusion Goggle-Enhanced).

Modern warfare resulted in an increase in airborne combat under the cover of darkness. Night missions include ground operations, preparation of the aircraft for take-off and landings in complete darkness, lights-off air refueling, and visual identification of enemy targets hidden under the night sky. Consequently, ground personnel and aircrew require the capability to see in very low visibility conditions at night and high ambient light conditions such as full moon or heavily lighted residential areas. The use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG) is critical for combat rescue, special operations, and homeland security missions. 

A lack of night vision capability would significantly decrease combat effectiveness in night operations, risk flight safety, and increase the probability of fratricide. Aircraft such as HH-60 helicopters, HC-130s, F-16s, and special mission C-130s primarily operate in low altitude environments during covert night operations. Hence, NVGs are vital to the success of these missions, providing a dramatic increase in safety, situational awareness, and survivability during the execution of near daytime tactics, including visual formation criteria. Furthermore, the proliferation of NVG-equipped adversaries underscores the urgent need to supply ground and air forces with night vision equipment.

Funding for this exhibit contained in Program Elements (PEs) 0702833F, 0207227F, and 0207588F.

Ground crew Goggles:

AN/PVS-14 Ground crew Goggle: This monocular night vision device is a hand-held, head-mounted, helmet-mounted, or weapon-mounted night vision system, which enables walking, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, map reading, vehicle maintenance, and first-aid administration during moonlight and starlight conditions. The AN/PVS-14 supports a vast spectrum of ground and air operations to include aircraft maintenance, civil engineering, emergency response, security, and other missions.   

AN/PVS-15 Ground crew Goggle: This binocular NVG is a helmet-mounted or hand-held night vision system, which is primarily used by Special Forces during night drop operations. The AN/PVS-15 can be used for all nighttime ground operations. An added benefit of this particular binocular goggle is the back-up capability in the event one of the two tubes fails.   

Guardian Angel Fusion Goggle - Enhanced (FGE):  The FGE is a helmet mounted dual waveband goggle which will increase identification and discrimination of combatants in most battlefield conditions and light levels through the use of image intensification fused with thermal imagery.  Continued procurement of systems are required for combat rescue until the next generation of multi-spectral NVGs are developed and available for ground crew operators. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.
 
    
Aircrew Goggles:     

AN/AVS-9 (F4949G-TG) Aircrew Goggle: This night vision goggle provides aircraft and ground personnel with the capability to see the horizon, terrain features and enemy ground fire, thereby reducing the potential for air-to-ground fratricide and mid-air collisions during night operations. The AN/AVS-9 (F4949-TG) is a light-weight, helmet-mounted goggle equipped with pinnacle tube technology that mitigates effects of sudden bright light exposure. 

Test Sets: 

ANV-20/20 Test Set, Infinity Focus: The ANV-20/20 is a portable instrument, which allows quick and accurate evaluation and adjustment of all goggle parameters. All NVGs require operational checkout.  

ANV-126A Test Set, Infrared Viewer: The ANV-126A is a commercial upgrade to the ANV-126, which is suitable for field operational checks and depot level NVG maintenance. This test set provides accurate checks for NVG resolution, gain, power drain, binocular goggle collimation, image quality, and image distortion. The ANV-126A uses state of the art technology and provides enhanced capabilities to the user.

ANV-126A-UGF Test Set, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kit: The ANV-126A-UGF is a commercial TCTO kit that converts the ANV-126 to the ANV-126A Test Set. 
   
In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), capabilities under this line item are necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and military support to civil authorities. Projected allocations for reserve component requirements are subject to total force demand priorities.

            <proc:Description>This program provides a wide variety of base support and safety of flight items for warfighters with worldwide application. 

Procures safety and rescue equipment for increased protection of aircrew personnel operating manned, non-space aircraft to optimize weapon system effectiveness and capability throughout the full spectrum of military operations. In general, the purpose of the PE is to expand the combat capabilities of a weapon system an airman supports while balancing functionality, comfort, and safety. Representative items include flight helmets, oxygen breathing equipment, flame resistant/retardant and blast/ballistic protective gear, laser eye protection, personnel locator beacons, nuclear flash blindness devices, personnel parachutes, ejection seats/equipment, survival radios, associated test sets, life rafts, life preservers, anti-exposure coveralls, aircrew flight ensembles, and other air/ground crew equipment. 

Guardian Angel Family of Systems:
Guardian Angel is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airman Modernization Program. Guardian Angel is a family of systems based on human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Combat Search and Rescue and personnel recovery across a full spectrum of military operations. Guardian Angel family of systems is employed by three distinct Air Force Specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) and Combat Rescue Officer (CRO). Representative items include but are not limited to parachute equipment, technical recovery equipment, information management systems, enhanced night vision systems, rescue watercraft and a Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) Training Simulator (simulator, maintenance &amp; mobile shelter costs) to supplement,  augment, and optimize current training events, independent of aircraft availability to align with strategic plans of the Next Generation LVC for training within the DoD. The enhanced night vision systems will include continued Procurement of Night Vision solutions that improve personnel recovery night visions systems with wider field of view, lower SWAP, and/or enhanced vision in at least one spectral band other than Near-IR. Procurement is required to meet mission needs until the next generation of multi-spectral NVGs are developed and available for ground crew operators. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements. This includes applicable training, spares, and repairs. Starting FY17 and thereafter, all funding and tasks for BPAC 842140 Night Vision Goggles have been moved to BPAC 842990 Items Less than $5 Million.  This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions,to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.  Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.

Funding for this effort is in program element 0408011F.  Representative items include but are not limited to training and simulators, assault zone, airfield marking tools, approach landing capability, weather data collection and analysis, personnel and technical recovery equipment, visual augmentation, unmanned capabilities, aerial insertion, ground transportation, and maritime. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements. This includes applicable training, spares, and repairs to manage, execute, and deliver Special Tactics weapon system capability. This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Special Tactics weapon system capability. Due to the rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.  

Modern warfare resulted in an increase in airborne combat under the cover of darkness. Night missions include ground operations, preparation of the aircraft for take-off and landings in complete darkness, lights-off air refueling, and visual identification of enemy targets hidden under the night sky. Consequently, ground personnel and aircrew require the capability to see in very low visibility conditions at night and high ambient light conditions such as full moon or heavily lighted residential areas. The use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG) is critical for combat rescue, special operations, and homeland security missions. 

A lack of night vision capability would significantly decrease combat effectiveness in night operations, risk flight safety, and increase the probability of fratricide. Aircraft such as HH-60 helicopters, HC-130s, F-16s, and special mission C-130s primarily operate in low altitude environments during covert night operations. Hence, NVGs are vital to the success of these missions, providing a dramatic increase in safety, situational awareness, and survivability during the execution of near daytime tactics, including visual formation criteria. Furthermore, the proliferation of NVG-equipped adversaries underscores the urgent need to supply ground and air forces with night vision equipment.

Ground crew Goggles:

AN/PVS-14 Ground crew Goggle: This monocular night vision device is a hand-held, head-mounted, helmet-mounted, or weapon-mounted night vision system, which enables walking, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, map reading, vehicle maintenance, and first-aid administration during moonlight and starlight conditions. The AN/PVS-14 supports a vast spectrum of ground and air operations to include aircraft maintenance, civil engineering, emergency response, security, and other missions.   

AN/PVS-15 Ground crew Goggle: This binocular NVG is a helmet-mounted or hand-held night vision system, which is primarily used by Special Forces during night drop operations. The AN/PVS-15 can be used for all nighttime ground operations. An added benefit of this particular binocular goggle is the back-up capability in the event one of the two tubes fails.   

AN/PVS-31A Ground Crew Goggle: This binocular night vision device (BNVD) is a helmet-mounted or handheld, battery operated night vision goggle that allows for observation and target identification under adverse conditions including light rain, light snow, and low light. The system amplifies ambient light so that the viewed scene becomes clearly visible to the operator. The BNVD is a follow-on to our legacy, battle proven AN/PVS-15, but offers more features for increased survivability. Rotating binocular design allows low profile against helmet when in stowed position and ability to use as a single monocular. 
    
Aircrew Goggles:     

AN/AVS-9 (F4949G-TG) Aircrew Goggle: This night vision goggle provides aircraft and ground personnel with the capability to see the horizon, terrain features and enemy ground fire, thereby reducing the potential for air-to-ground fratricide and mid-air collisions during night operations. The AN/AVS-9 (F4949-TG) is a light-weight, helmet-mounted goggle equipped with pinnacle tube technology that mitigates effects of sudden bright light exposure. 

Test Sets: 

ANV-20/20 Test Set, Infinity Focus: The ANV-20/20 is a portable instrument, which allows quick and accurate evaluation and adjustment of all goggle parameters. All NVGs require operational checkout.  

ANV-126A Test Set, Infrared Viewer: The ANV-126A is a commercial upgrade to the ANV-126, which is suitable for field operational checks and depot level NVG maintenance. This test set provides accurate checks for NVG resolution, gain, power drain, binocular goggle collimation, image quality, and image distortion. The ANV-126A uses state of the art technology and provides enhanced capabilities to the user.

ANV-126A-UGF Test Set, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kit: The ANV-126A-UGF is a commercial TCTO kit that converts the ANV-126 to the ANV-126A Test Set.

            <proc:Description>The Mechanized Materials Handling Equipment line provides funding for Mechanized Materials Handling Systems (MMHS) and Storage Aids Systems (SAS). 

MMHS and SAS equipment provide bases worldwide with automated and static equipment to store, receive, and ship materiel. MMHS and SAS equipment involves the design and acquisition of mechanized and non-mechanized materials handling systems such as receiving, storage, and distribution systems; high density storage systems; and a variety of SAS equipment including racks, bin shelving, modular cabinets, and mezzanines. 

Transportation systems generally include equipment such as heavy duty freight handling 463L conveyors, pallet buildup/breakdown lift conveyor stations, cargo staging racks, and overhead bridge cranes for air freight terminal systems; roller conveyors and overhead cranes for aerial delivery facility systems; inbound and outbound baggage conveyors and passenger boarding bridges for air passenger terminals.

Other types of MMHS include narrow aisle vehicle replacements and external aircraft fuel tank storage systems.

Adequately equipped facilities are essential to the storage and handling of weapon system components, and the processing of personnel, freight, and baggage to reduce pipeline time and to provide enhanced Air Force capability to respond to crises and threats whenever they occur in the world.

Program elements associated with this P-1 Line are 0202834F, 0702834F, 0802834F, 0402834F, 0502834F, 0502844F, 0207597F, and 0401319F.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 procurement funds for MMHS/SAS equipment increases the productivity of Air Force operations, enhances management control of assets, reduces multiple handling of logistics materiel by consolidating assets, increases flexibility at a minimum investment cost, enhances safety, reduces losses due to damage of materiel in transport, and reduces congestion and delays in the receiving, storage and issue operations in supply, base level aircraft maintenance, and transportation facilities. Also provides critical support for mission readiness supporting the F-35 beddown as well as F-16 realignment resulting from the F-35 beddown. 

FY18 MMHE is to be purchased in the following quantities: 1 crane system, 3 conveyor systems, 6 high density storage systems, 2 receiving, storage and distribution systems, and 13 storage aid systems.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Justification>Base Procured Equipment: 

Power Conditioning &amp; Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE): 
The PCCIE Program Office procures, replaces and modernizes uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems to meet Air Force requirements.  Many of these systems have exceeded the life expectancy of 12-15 years.  PCCIE program is structured into small projects (from 3 - 125 kilovolt amps (kva)) and large projects (greater than 125 kva) and includes associated ancillary equipment.

PE 84731F - funds procure: 

a). Keesler Trainer/Simulator for Expeditionary Combat Support Radio Course: TS-4528A/U Multi-Channel DOCCT/S System (2x 3U), Two Channel, Lab/Class Local RF; Includes redundant power supply, training &amp; IW Phase II channel control capability. This item simulates a UHF satellite terminal 
control station as well as the satellite system itself. It enables two-satellite ground terminals to establish a connection and pass data and voice communications to each other. It is used to certify objective completion in the Expeditionary Combat Support Radio course. 

b). Goodfellow AFB Fire Training Burn Trainers: New Fire Cause and Fire Inspection Trainers, Structural Burn Training Fire Box and SBCA Compressor and Air Pack Fill Station Replacement. 

c). Parachute System for Pararescue and Combat Rescue Officer training (Lackland AFB): Purchase of RamAir (RA-1) Parachute System  

PE 84752F - funds procure Laboratory equipment for AF Institute of Technology. 

Power Conditioning &amp; Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE):
The new systems collectively satisfy critical user requirements and will:
1. Reduce overall footprint and weight by 50-60%.
2. Reduce operating and sustainment costs by 30%-50%.
3. Reduce acquisition costs as it applies to installation since many newer systems consist of more internal pre-wiring.
4. Lower parts count dramatically improves reliability by reducing the potential points of failure within the system.
5. Produce greater energy savings and higher operating efficiency in all configurations, typically between 92% and 93.5%; with all types of loads.
The Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems protect sensitive electronic equipment/systems such as command and control centers, intelligence missions, radars, etc.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program funds procurement of Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR). It includes equipment to support the bed down of deployed forces (personnel, aircraft and support equipment) at austere and semi-austere locations. BEAR assets are a critical Agile Combat Support enabler for the Expeditionary Air Force. BEAR is composed of five types of air base capability packages: housekeeping, feeding, hygiene, power generation and flight line. Flight line packages consist of airfield lighting, aircraft hangars, fire stations, and numerous additional systems to support airfield operations. The program provides funding to procure new and replacement equipment items, and multi-media packages required to support BEAR training facilities at Silver Flag Sites, Regional Training Sites, Technical Schools, Technical Certification Centers, Services Combat Center Training, 635MMG, and Eagle Flag. Costs include inventory reconstitution, spares and consumables, repairs, and procurement of new equipment for upgrades or full UTC's replacement. BEAR demonstrated its critical role in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and other operations worldwide. 

The AF continues to modernize major BEAR components to replace obsolete and inefficient items (e.g., Power Generation, Hygiene, Refrigeration,EALS, MAAS, Shelters, and Feeding): 

Force Module Water System: Water System takes non-potable water and converts it into potable water. The system is modular and scalable in design and consists of Source Run, Water Production, Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), Initial, Follow-on, and Industrial Operations, Flight line Extension, freeze protection, grey water recovery, pumping, piping, and storage equipment; applicable fittings; and other components such as fluid control valves. 

Power System: Consists of prime and secondary power equipment which provides the capability to generate and distribute power to billeting, feeding, flight line and industrial operations at forward deployed sites. The primary power source for BEAR bed down locations is the BEAR Power Unit (BPU). The BPU is an 800 kilowatt (kW) Tier II compliant diesel generator. The power from the BPU is distributed through buried high voltage cabling and stepped down to facility power through the Secondary Distribution Center (SDC). The SDC is a 150 kilovolt-ampere (KVA) transformer capable of supporting twelve (12) billeting shelters via the Primary Distribution Panels (PDP). 

Expeditionary Airfield Lighting System (EALS)(Legacy): Light Emitting Diode (LED) and incandescent runway lighting system designed to be rapidly installed at contingency airfields and at other locations that need temporary airfield lighting. The lighting kit for runways includes runway edge and threshold lights, precision approach path indicator (PAPI), and strobe approach lights, distance to go marker lamps, taxi way lamps and battery-operated obstruction lights. The EALS also includes the generators, cables, control cables, transformers and regulators. The entire system is packaged on six (6) mobile trailers. System will be replaced with a Next Generation System over the FYDP.

Mobile Aircraft Arresting System: This air transportable barrier arresting Bak-12 mounted on a mobile trailer to accommodate the recovery of fighter aircraft returning to battle damaged airfield. 

Hygiene: Hygiene includes Shower, Shave and Latrine, WH-400 water heaters for initial Hygiene fielding and Self Help Laundry system which provides personal hygiene facilities in support of BEAR bases. 

Hygiene Shelters: Hygiene Shelters are designed to be used as changing rooms connecting to the BEAR Hygiene System. The shelters support personnel utilizing BEAR Hygiene Systems. 

Refrigeration: Refrigeration units designed for the carriage of deep frozen, frozen, chilled and general cargo by road, rail, air, and sea (above or below deck), suitable for austere environmental conditions. It is used to support the BEAR services, feeding and mortuary operations. 

Shelters: Shelters vary in sizes and are needed for billeting, kitchen, hygiene, and aircraft and equipment maintenance. Includes lighting, electrical equipment, environmental control units, remote area lighting, Shelter Flies, Shelter Flooring/matting for various shelter sizes, Shelter liners. 

Shelter Flooring: Shelter flooring varies in size for small and large shelters (ACH, LAMS, Mortuary). 

Feeding: BEAR Feeding includes kitchen and all applicable equipment. BEAR Feeding system provides the capability to prepare, and then serve, 500 meals over a two hour serving period, twice per day (24 hour period). The Feeding system is worldwide deployable and supports numerous basing options. This system supports initial mission requirements and follow-on high mobility feeding requirements for rapidly deployable mobility packages and other contingencies in all theaters of operation. 

10K Fuel Bladder: Collapsible, coated fabric fuel bladders are often used as an auxiliary fuel source for MEP generators. This is especially true for high fuel-consumption prime power generators. 

Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC): provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality.

Environmental Control Unit (ECU): Heat Pump to provide cooling, heating via reversing valve (heat pump) and supplemental heat via resistance heat strips.

Training/Multi-Media Training - Provides BEAR and items for all training sites and funds for all required BEAR multi-media training requirements.

"Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Request for Additional Appropriations": $34.982 million is required to address emergency warfighting readiness requirements. Power generation is a must to sustain operations at austere locations. BEAR Power Unit is a modernization effort to replace legacy power units that have out lived life expectancy and no longer have repair capability. Purchasing BEAR PU requirements early allows assembly line to continue without interruption for a smooth requirement fulfillment.

            <proc:Description>This program provides a wide variety of base support items with worldwide application, to include but not limited to: aircraft arresting systems; IPE Equipment; Fuels Support Equipment; Generator Power plants, Deployable Debrief Facilities (DDF) and related cargo pallet systems. This equipment provides prime support for all base missions. Lack of funding for these equipment items limits maintenance capabilities, testing functions, anti-terrorism/security missions, communications capabilities, flight operations, and the ability of Air Force units to meet deployment requirements. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. 

Program elements associated with this P-1 Line are: 0202834F, 0207142F, 0208031F, 0208534F,  0401221F, 0402834F, 0502834F, 0502844F, 0702834F, 0802834F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>RC-135 procurement is executed by the Big Safari RC-135 Program Manager (PM) and is supported by various contractors.  The contractors provide services including Program Depot Maintenance (PDM), prime mission equipment overhaul, special repair activity, in-plant support (sustainment engineering, software engineering, and program management), configuration management, LRU repair, and field service maintenance and training for special operational missions.  The RC-135 Program Manager provides the full-range of weapons system management, acquisition oversight, program security and integrated logistics for the RC-135 aircraft, power plant, sensors and associated support and equipment.  Due to the rapidly changing global threat environment, the PM has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander and Intelligence Community (IC) requirements.

Program element associated with this line is 0305207F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 procurement funding acquires and installs various upgrade and enhancement modifications for ground support equipment associated with the RC-135 program.  This ground support equipment is directly tied to fielded baselines of the RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT, RC-135S COBRA BALL, and the RC-135U COMBAT SENT.  The requirement to maintain commonality with fielded baselines necessitates the continuous modification and installation of upgrades concurrent with RC-135 aircraft entering operational status.  These ground systems are critical to the post-mission processing of highly perishable intelligence information, and supporting aircrew proficiency training, virtual simulation exercises that contribute to distributed mission training initiatives, and provide support to indigenous maintenance during aircraft deployments to "bare-base” locations.  Additionally, all applicable ground support equipment is required to comply with NSA intelligence data recording formats and requirements due to the nature and sensitivity of the information.

Ground support equipment includes, but is not limited to:  RIVET JOINT Mission Trainer (RJMT), Ground Data Processing System (GDPS), Mission Crew Training System (MCTS), Modular Processing System (MPS), and the Airborne Capability Extension System (ACES).</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>RC-135 procurement is executed by the Big Safari RC-135 Program Manager (PM) and is supported by various contractors.  The contractors provide services including Program Depot Maintenance (PDM), prime mission equipment overhaul, special repair activity, in-plant support (sustainment engineering, software engineering, and program management), configuration management, LRU repair, and field service maintenance and training for special operational missions.  The RC-135 Program Manager provides the full-range of weapons system management, acquisition oversight, program security and integrated logistics for the RC-135 aircraft, power plant, sensors and associated support and equipment.  Due to the rapidly changing global threat environment, the PM has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander and Intelligence Community (IC) requirements.

FY18 procurement funding acquires and installs various upgrade and enhancement modifications for ground support equipment associated with the RC-135 program.  This ground support equipment is directly tied to fielded baselines of the RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT, RC-135S COBRA BALL, and the RC-135U COMBAT SENT.  The requirement to maintain commonality with fielded baselines necessitates the continuous modification and installation of upgrades concurrent with RC-135 aircraft entering operational status.  These ground systems are critical to the post-mission processing of highly perishable intelligence information, and supporting aircrew proficiency training, virtual simulation exercises that contribute to distributed mission training initiatives, and provide support to indigenous maintenance during aircraft deployments to "bare-base” locations.  Additionally, all applicable ground support equipment is required to comply with NSA intelligence data recording formats and requirements due to the nature and sensitivity of the information.

Ground support equipment includes, but is not limited to:  RIVET JOINT Mission Trainer (RJMT), Ground Data Processing System (GDPS), Mission Crew Training System (MCTS), Modular Processing System (MPS), and the Airborne Capability Extension System (ACES).

            <proc:Description>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS)/PE0305208F is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system architecture for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT network linked weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites, and other collection systems. AF DCGS is designed to support joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements. Currently, the AF DCGS worldwide architecture is composed of two worldwide core sites, three regional core sites, two remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, four National Mission Partner (NMP) sites, three support sites, and multiple National Guard Bureau (NGB) sites. Currently, AF DCGS is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance by providing quality and fused Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.  

AF DCGS is transforming by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs. These efforts will also integrate commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as enhance interoperability by migrating to an Open Architecture (OA) to improve data sharing ability per DoD direction.

AF DCGS is managed in eight efforts: GEOINT (GB 4.1), GEOINT Transformation, Systems Release (SR 3.0), SIGINT Transformation, Sensor Integration, Multi-INT, Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT): 

1. GB 4.1: The GEOINT Baseline 4.1 (GB4.1) effort completes the Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system.  It also integrates Airborne Cuing and Exploitation System, Hyper Spectral ACES-HY (MQ-1) and Global Hawk Block 40 capability into AF DCGS.
2. GEOINT Transformation: The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
3. *SR 3.0: The Systems Release (3.0) effort completes SIGINT Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system. Provides the ability to PCPAD the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) family of systems and integrates the Common Intelligence Collections System (CICS) capability. 
4. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrate new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities into the open architecture framework. 
5. Sensor Integration: The Sensor Integration effort rapidly integrates AF, Joint, &amp; Coalition Sensor data into DCGS Enterprise to ingest data, perform sensor planning, and Command &amp; Control.
6. Multiple-Intelligence(Multi-INT): Provides and supports Open Architecture-based Enterprise Services, moves to commodity hardware, a virtual desktop environment, and facilitates enterprise-wide collaborative tools.
7. Network Infrastructure Transformation: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture.
8. DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.

                    <proc:Description>The Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
Furthermore, GEOINT Transformation provides continuous and incremental improvement to the capability for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of advanced imagery intelligence. GEOINT Transformation builds upon GB4.1 to integrate new sensors, provide enhanced processing techniques, and provide imagery analysts the advanced capability to exploit, analyze, produce, and disseminate imagery.

Justification:
AF DCGS's GEOINT program's main focus is the procurement and fielding of proven technologies for multiple programs including GEOINT Transformation.  The GEOINT Transformation leverages an agile infrastructure to use modern information technology (IT) practices and sets the stage from which to accomplish the goals of the AF DCGS architecture roadmap in manageable increments.  GEOINT Transformation builds on the GB4.1 foundation to provide enhanced front-end image processing and advanced exploitation tools, which improve the timeliness and quality of GEOINT products, making them more useful to the war-fighter while simultaneously reducing the workload on the DCGS operator.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture. Furthermore, the Infrastructure Transformation program adds capabilities to the baseline of the FOC weapon system already fielded and does not replace it.

Justification:  
AF DCGS's Network Infrastructure Transformation program's main focus is the procurement and fielding of proven technologies for network communications, centralized storage of imagery and full motion video, communication modernization, demilitarized zone, weapon system trainer, and x86 infrastructure and addresses diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) weapons system issues. This program will continue to deliver an integrated net-centric upgrade to the network communications infrastructure; and address any other DMS issues that are identified with legacy systems/components that AF DCGS must interface with. Additionally, upgrades will meet the operational need to store and disseminate new and/or improved sensor data, and enhance interoperability by migrating to an open architecture construct and improving data sharing ability in compliance with DoD direction.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrates the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities to the open architecture framework.  The SIGINT Segment provides command and control (C2) of ISR sensors, data processing, and data distribution to the customers in near real time from connected sensors at both core and remote sites.

Justification:
AF DCGS SIGINT Transformation's main focus is AF DCGS connectivity to NSANET. In order to accomplish this, SIGINT modernization must take place within the OA DCGS environment. This includes migration of SR3.0 software to an X86 environment and SIGINT workstation modernization. The NSANET project consists of SIGINT Ops on United States Cryptologic System (USCS) network, streaming special signal audio onto NSA domain for DMS sites, AF DCGS near real time tactical capabilities, DCGS/Rivet Joint (RJ) weapons system interoperability, automated language and speaker identification, AF DCGS demultiplexing capability and providing DMS sites with NSANET connectivity.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) reference imagery data.  This effort transitions AF DCGS reference imagery from the Direct Feed Image Product Library (DFIPL) to a centralized storage solution and distributes imagery across the DCGS Enterprise through a cloud architecture consisting of multiple data hubs, known as Data Storage and Dissemination (DSDs). Furthermore, this project will enhance the imagery distribution network of AF DCGS to allow the cloud architecture throughout several sites within the weapon system.

Justification:
The AF DRT effort's main focus is the procurement and fielding of proven technologies to centralize the storage and dissemination of imagery for the AF DCGS weapon system. This effort is necessary to transfer the reference imagery data path from the current retiring data path to the long term ACC vision for the weapon system. This effort also enhances the network backbone for the weapon system as it moves toward a cloud architecture for the distribution of data.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Initial Spares consist of reparable components, assemblies, subassemblies, and consumable items required as initial stock (including readiness spares package requirements) in support of newly fielded vehicles, communications electronics and telecommunications equipment, and other base maintenance and support equipment items.  Requirements are determined by applying established factors against the acquisition cost of the end items.  The factors are based on historical data of similar equipment, employment/deployment concepts, production schedules, and other related information.

The funding for the following programs was transferred to the Space Procurement, Air Force appropriation beginning in FY17:
Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals (FAB-T)
